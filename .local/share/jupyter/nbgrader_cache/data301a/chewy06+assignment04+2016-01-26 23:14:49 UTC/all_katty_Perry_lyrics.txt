I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything
You held me down, but I got up (hey!)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, your hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake your ground
You held me down, but I got up
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am the champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar!
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar!
Now I'm floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero
You held me down, but I got up (hey!)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, your hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am the champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar!
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar!
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar!
Roar, roar, roar, roar, roar!
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am the champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar!
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar!
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar!
Do you ever feel
Like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind
Wanting to start again
Do you ever feel
Feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards
One blow from caving in
Do you ever feel
Already buried deep
Six feet under
Screams but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's
Still a chance for you
'Cause there's a spark in you
You just gotta
Ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show them what you're worth
Make them go, "Oh, oh, oh"
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on let your colors burst
Make them go, "Oh, oh, oh"
You're gonna leave them all in awe
You don't have to feel
Like a waste of space
You're original
Cannot be replaced
If you only knew
What the future holds
After a hurricane
Comes a rainbow
Maybe the reason why
All the doors are closed
So you could open one
That leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt
Your heart will glow
And when it's time you know
You just gotta
Ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show them what you're worth
Make them go, "Oh, oh, oh"
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on let your colors burst
Make them go, "Oh, oh, oh"
You're gonna leave them all in awe
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show them what you're worth
Make them go, "Oh, oh, oh"
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on let your colors burst
Make them go, "Oh, oh, oh"
You're gonna leave them all in awe
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
Yeah you, PMS
Like a bitch
I would know
And you over think
Always speak
Cryptically
I should know
That you're no good for me
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really want to stay, no
(You) But you don't really want to go-o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
We used to be
Just like twins
So in sync
The same energy
Now's a dead battery
Used to laugh bout nothing
Now you're plain boring
I should know that
You're not gonna change
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really want to stay, no
(You) But you don't really want to go-o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bi-polar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride
You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really want to stay, no
(You) But you don't really want to go-o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down, down.
Summer after high school when we first met
We made out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you
In another life I would be your girl
We keep all our promises, be us against the world
And in other life I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away!
I was June and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, (whoa)
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse
In another life I would be your girl
We keep all our promises, be us against the world
And in another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
The o-o-o-o-one
The o-o-o-o-one
The o-o-o-o-one
The one that got away
All this money can't buy me a time machine, (Nooooo)
Can't replace you with a million rings, (Nooooo)
I should've told you what you meant to me, (whoa)
'Cause now I pay the price
In another life I would be your girl
We keep all our promises, be us against the world
And in another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
The o-o-o-o-one
The o-o-o-o-one
The o-o-o-o-one
And in another life I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away!
You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil, could you be an angel
Your touch magnetizing
Feels like I'm floating, leaves my body glowing
They say be afraid
You're not like the others, futuristic lovers
Different DNA, they don't understand you
You're from a whole other world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light
Kiss me, k-k-kiss me
Infect me with your love and fill me with your poison
Take me, t-t-take me
Wanna be a victim, ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign
Its supernatural, extraterrestrial
You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers, stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic, every move is magic
You're from a whole other world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light
Kiss me, k-k-kiss me
Infect me with your love, and fill me with your poison
Take me, t-t-take me
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign
Its supernatural, extraterrestrial
There is this transcendental, on another level
Boy, you're my lucky star
I wanna walk on your wave length
And be there when you vibrate
For you I risk it all, all
Kiss me, k-k-kiss me
Infect me with your love and fill me with your poison
Take me, t-t-take me
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign
It's supernatural, extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial, extraterrestrial
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign
Its supernatural, extraterrestrial
You think I'm pretty without any make-up on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me, so I let my walls come down, down
Before you met me, I was all right
But things were kinda heavy, you brought me to life
Now every February you'll be my valentine, valentine
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, will be young forever
You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now baby I believe
This is real, so take a chance
And don't ever look back, don't ever look back
We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever
You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now baby I believe
This is real, so take a chance
And don't ever look back, don't ever look back
I'ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Youuuu You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's runaway and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now baby I believe
This is real, so take a chance
And don't ever look back, don't ever look back
I'ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
I knew you were
You were gonna come to me
And here you are
But you better choose carefully
'Cause I'm capable of anything
Of anything and everything
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy, your enemy, your enemy
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for
Baby do you dare to do this
'Cause I'm coming atcha like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, a perfect storm
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back
Mark my words
This love will make you levitate
Like a bird
Like a bird without a cage
But down to earth
If you choose to walk away, don't walk away
It's in the palm of your hand now baby
It's a yes or no, no maybe
So just be sure before you give it up to me
Up to me, give it up to me
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for
Baby do you dare to do this
'Cause I'm coming atcha like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, a perfect storm
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back
She's a beast
I call her Karma
She eat your heart out
Like Jeffrey Dahmer
Be careful
Try not to lead her on
Shawty's heart was on steroids
'Cause her love was so strong
You may fall in love
When you meet her
If you get the chance you better keep her
She's sweet as pie, but if you break her heart
She'll turn cold as a freezer
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my Sleeping Beauty
I'm gon' put her in a coma
Woo! Damn I think I love her
Shawty so bad
I'm sprung and I don't care
She got me like a roller coaster
Turn the bedroom into a fair
Her love is like a drug
I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil' mama so dope
I messed around and got addicted
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for
Baby do you dare to do this
'Cause I'm coming atcha like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, a perfect storm
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back
There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbecue
Is this a hickey or a bruise?
Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well
It's a blacked-out blur
But I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn
Last Friday night
Yeah we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a menage a trios
Last Friday night
Yeah I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op
ooh-ohh
This Friday night
Do it all again
This Friday night
Do it all again
Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrants out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail
Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well

Days like this,
I want to drive away
Pack my bags
And watch your shadow fade
You chewed me up
And spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light
You drained me down
But that was then
And this is now
Now look at me!
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and stones,
Throw your bombs and bones,
But you're not gonna break my soul.
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
You ripped me off,
Your love was cheap
It was always tearing at the seams,
I fell deep, you let me down,
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me!
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and stones,
Throw your bombs and bones,
But you're not gonna break my soul.
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no!
Now look at me I'm sparkling,
A firework, a dancing' flame
You won't ever put me out again
I'm glowing', oh woah,
So you can keep the diamond ring,
It don't mean nothing anyway,
In fact you can keep everything, yeah, yeah, yeah
Except for me!
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and stones,
Throw your bombs and bones,
But you're not gonna break my
Soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and stones,
Throw your bombs and bones,
But you're not gonna break my
Soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
no, no
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
Yeah, I was in the dark
I was falling hard
With an open heart
I'm wide awake
How did I read the stars so wrong
I'm wide awake
And now it's clear to me
That everything you see
Ain't always what it seems
I'm wide awake
Yeah, I was dreaming for so long
I wish I knew then
What I know now
Wouldn't dive in
Wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts
You made it so sweet
Till I woke up on
On the concrete
Falling from cloud nine
Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight
I'm falling from cloud nine
I'm wide awake
Not losing any sleep
Picked up every piece
And landed on my feet
I'm wide awake
Need nothing to complete myself, no
I'm wide awake
Yeah, I am born again
Out of the lion's den
I don't have to pretend
And it's too late
The story's over now, the end
I wish I knew then
What I know now
Wouldn't dive in
Wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts
You made it so sweet
Till I woke up on
On the concrete
Falling from cloud nine
Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight
I'm falling from cloud nine
Thunder rumbling
Castles crumbling
I am trying to hold on
God knows that I tried
Seeing the bright side
But I'm not blind anymore
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
Falling from cloud nine
Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight
I'm falling from cloud nine
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
[Snoop Dogg]
Greetings, loved ones
Let's take a journey
[Katy Perry]
I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sippin gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees, undone
The boys, break their necks
Trying to creep a little sneak peek, at us
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close
To the Golden Coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh oh oh oh
California gurls
We're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot
We'll melt your popsicle
Oh oh oh oh
California gurls
We're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce
We got it on lock
West coast represent
Now put your hands up
Oh oh oh oh
Sex on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo, oh oh
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close
To the Golden Coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh oh oh oh
California gurls
We're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot
We'll melt your popsicle
Oh oh oh oh
California gurls
We're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce
We got it on lock
West Coast represent
Now put your hands up
Oh oh oh oh
[Snoop Dogg]
Toned tan, fit and ready
Turn it up 'cause it's getting heavy
Wild, wild, West Coast
These are the girls I love the most
I mean the ones
I mean like she's the one
Kiss her, touch her,
Squeeze her buns
The girl's a freak
She drives a jeep
And live on the beach
I'm okay, I won't play
I love the bait, just like I love L.A.
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summer time is everything
Homeboys bangin' out
All that ass hangin' out
Bikinis, zucchinis, martinis
No weenies
Just a king and a queenie

Comparisons are easily done
Once you've had a taste of perfection
Like an apple hanging from a tree
I picked the ripest one
I still got the seed
You said move on
Where do I go
I guess second best
Is all I will know
Cause when I'm with him
I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one
Who was spending the night
Oh I wish that I
Was looking into your eyes
You're like an Indian summer
In the middle of winter
Like a hard candy
With a surprise center
How do I get better
Once I've had the best
You said there's
Tons of fish in the water
So the waters I will test
He kissed my lips
I taste your mouth
He pulled me in
I was disgusted with myself
Cause when I'm with him
I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one
Who was spending the night
Oh I wish that I
Was looking into your eyes
You're the best
And yes I do regret
How I could let myself
Let you go
Now the lesson's learned
I touched it I was burned
Oh I think you should know
Cause when I'm with him
I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one
Who was spending the night
Oh I wish that I
Was looking into your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Oh won't you walk through
And bust in the door
And take me away
Oh no more mistakes
Cause in your eyes I'd like to stay
This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what, I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chap stick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it
No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what, good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chap stick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it
Us girls we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chap stick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it
Oh no, did I get too close oh?
Oh, did I almost see what's really on the inside?
All your insecurities
All the dirty laundry
Never made me blink one time
Unconditional, unconditionally
I will love you unconditionally
There is no fear now
Let go and just be free
I will love you unconditionally
Come just as you are to me
Don't need apologies
Know that you are all worthy
I'll take your bad days with your good
Walk through this storm I would
I'd do it all because I love you, I love you
Unconditional, unconditionally
I will love you unconditionally
There is no fear now
Let go and just be free
I will love you unconditionally
So open up your heart and just let it begin
Open up your heart, and just let it begin
Open up your heart, and just let it begin
Open up your heart
Acceptance is the key to be
To be truly free
Will you do the same for me?
Unconditional, unconditionally
I will love you unconditionally
And there is no fear now
Let go and just be free
'Cause I will love you unconditionally (oh yeah)
I will love you
I will love you
I will love you unconditionally
I wanna see your peacock, cock, cock
Your peacock, cock
Your peacock, cock, cock
Your peacock
I wanna see your peacock, cock, cock
Your peacock, cock
Your peacock, cock, cock
Your peacock
Word on the street, you got somethin' to show me, me
Magical, colorful, Mr. Mystery, ee
I'm intrigued, for a peek, heard it's fascinating
Come on baby let me see
What you're hiding underneath
Words are mislead
Such a tease
Wanna see the show-ow
In 3-D, a movie
Heard it's beautiful
Be the judge
And my girls gonna take a vote
Come on baby let me see
What you're hiding underneath
I want the jaw droppin', eye popin', head turnin', body shockin'
(Uh, uh, oh, Uh, uh, uh, oh)
I want my heart throbbin', ground shakin, show stoppi'n, amazin'
(Uh, uh, oh, Uh, uh, uh, oh)

I hope you hang yourself with your H&M; scarf
While jacking off listening to Mozart
You bitch and moan about LA
Wishing you were in the rain reading Hemingway
You don't eat meat
And drive electrical cars
You're so indie rock it's almost an art
You need SPF 45 just to stay alive

Was 27 surviving my return to Saturn
A long vacation didn't sound so bad
Was full of secrets locked up tight like iron melting
Running on empty, so out of gas
Thought I wasn't enough and I wasn't so tough
Laying on the bathroom floor
We were living on a fault line
And I felt the fault was all mine
Couldn't take it any more
By the grace of God (there was no other way)
I picked myself back up (I knew I had to stay)
I put one foot in front of the other and I
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out
That way
I thank my sister for keeping my head above the water
When the truth was like swallowing sand
Now every morning
There is no more morning oh I
Can finally see myself again
I know I am enough
Possible to be loved
It was not about me
Now I have to rise above
Let the universe call the bluff
Yeah the truth will set you free
By the grace of God (there was no other way)
I picked myself back up (I knew I had to stay)
I put one foot in front of the other and I
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out
That way no
There ain't no
Not in the name of love
In the name of love (in the name of love)
That way
There ain't no
I'm not giving up
By the grace of God
I picked myself back up
I put one foot in front of the other and I
Looked in the mirror (looked in the mirror)
Looked in the mirror (looked in the mirror)
By the grace of God (there was no other way)
I picked myself back up (I knew I had to stay)
I put one foot in front of the other and I
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out
That way
You make me feel like I'm losing my virginity
The first time, every time when you touchin' me,
I make you bloom like the flower that you never seen
Under the sun we are one buzzin' energy
Let's pollinate, let's create a family tree
This evolution with you comes naturally
Some call it science,
We call it chemistry
This is the story of the birds and the bees
Even the seasons change
Our love still stays the same
You give me that
Hummingbird heartbeat
Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me the hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Flown a million miles just to find the magic seed
Oh I would flower with the power that bring light to me
Your so exotic, my whole body fluttering
Constantly craving for a taste of your sticky sweet
Always on the brink of a heart attack
You keep me alive and keep me coming back
I see the sun rise in your eyes
Your eyes
You gotta future full of blue skies
Blue skies
Even when seasons change
I'm still stay the same
You give me that
Hummingbird heartbeat
Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me the Hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
You love me, you love me never love me not
Not
Oh no
When we're in perfect harmony
You make me sound like, like a symphony
Oh your wings could make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me the hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me the hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Hey yeah
Hummingbird heartbeat
Hey yeah
Hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
You gotta help me out
It's all a blur last night
We need a taxi 'cause you're hung-over and I'm broke
I lost my fake id but you lost the motel key
Spare me your freakin' dirty looks
Now don't blame me
You roll the cash out
And get the hell out of town
Don't be a baby
Remember what you told me
Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Why are these lights so bright
Oh, did we get hitched last night, dressed up like Elvis,
Why, am I wearing your class ring?
Don't call your mother
Cause now we're partners in crime
Don't be a baby
Remember what you told me
Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
You got me into this
Information overload, situation lost control
Send out an S.O.S.
And get some cash out
We're gonna tear up the town
Don't be a baby
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me
Told me, you told me, you told me
Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
That's what you get baby, shake the glitter, shake, shake, shake the glitter
Give me some cash out, baby
Give me some cash out, baby
This is the last time you say
After the last line you break
It's not even a holiday
Nothing to celebrate
You give a hundred reasons why
And you say you're really gonna try
If I had a nickel for every time
I'd own the bank
Thought that I was the exception
I could reroute your addiction
You could've been the greatest
But you'd rather get wasted
You fall asleep during foreplay
Cause the pills you take are more your forte
I'm not sticking around to watch you go down
Wanna be your lover, not your fucking mother
Can't be your savior; I don't have the power
I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain
You say you have to write your rhymes
Whatever helps you sleep at night
You've become what you despise
A stereotype
You think you're so rock and roll
But you're really just a joke
Had the world in the palm of your hands
But you fucking choked
Should've been my team mate
Could've changed your fate
You say that you love me
You won't remember in the morning
You fall asleep during foreplay
Cause the pills you take are more your forte
I'm not sticking around to watch you go down
Wanna be your lover, not your fucking mother
Can't be your savior; I don't have the power
I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain
You fall asleep during foreplay
Cause the pills you take are more your forte
I'm not sticking around to watch you go down
Wanna be your lover, not your fucking mother
Can't be your savior; I don't have the power
I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain
You fall asleep during foreplay
Cause the pills you take are more your forte
I'm not sticking around to watch you go down
[Snoop Dogg]
Greetings loved ones,
Let's take a journey!
[Katy Perry]
I know a place,
Where the grass is really greener!
Warm, wet and wild,
There must be something in the water!
Sippin' gin 'n' juice,
Laying underneath the palm trees!
The boys, break their necks,(and done)
try'na creep a little sneak peek,
at us!
You could travel the world,
But nothin' comes close,
To the golden coast!
Once you party with u-us,
you'll be fallin' in love!
Oh oh oh ohhhhhhh!
California girls, we're unforgettable,
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top!
Sunkissed skin,
So hot we'll melt your popsicle!
Oh oh oh ohhhhhhh!
California girls, we're undeniable,
Fine, fresh, fierce,
We got it on lock!
West coast represent, now put your hands up!
Oh oh oh ohhhhhhh!
Sex, on the beach,
We don't mind sand in our stilettos!
We fre-e-eak in my Jeep,
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo!
You could travel the world,
But nothin' comes close,
To the golden co-oast
Once you party with u-us,
you'll be fallin' in love!
Oh oh oh ohhhhhhh!
California girls, we're unforgettable,
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top!
Sunkissed skin,
So hot we'll melt your popsicle!
Oh oh oh ohhhhhhh!

We got it on lock!

Oh oh oh ohhhhhhh!
[Snoop Dogg]
Toned, tanned fit and ready,
turn it up 'cos it's gettin' heavy,
wild, wild, west coast,
these are the girls I love the most!
I mean the ones,
I mean like she's the one,
Kiss her,
Touch her,
Squeeze her buns...
The girl's a freak,
She drives a Jeep,
And lives on the beach.
I'm okay
I won't play
I love the Bay
Just like I love L.A.
Venice Beach
And Palm Springs
Summertime is everything!
Homeboys
Hangin' out

Never made me blink one time

Let go and just be free

Through the storm

Let go and just be free
Cause I will love you
Unconditionally

Can you tell me
Who called the race?
Can anyone stay in one place?
And when you get to the finish line
Will you wish for more time or say
One day
One day you will
But maybe one day you will find
That you just can't push rewind
All we have is this moment
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
All we have is this moment
To put our love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
Be here with me now
Do you ever think that
We're just chasing our tails?
Like life is one big fast treadmill
And we pop what is prescribed
If it gets us first prize but you know
Who I
Who I think will win
Are the ones that love loving
Are the ones that take the time
All we have is this moment
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
All we have is this moment
To put our love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
Be here with me now
Be here with me now
'Cause refuge check is right now, right in front on you
Don't let the clock, the clock tell you what to do
If you check right now, I'm in front of you
Baby don't blink and miss
This moment
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
All we have is this moment
To put our love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me yeah
Be here with me now
Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air
Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air
You're giving me sweet, sweet ecstasy
Yeah, you take me to utopia
You're reading me like erotica,
Boy, you make me feel exotic, yeah
Just when I think I can't take anymore
We go deeper and harder than ever before
We go higher and higher
I feel like I'm already there
I'm walking on air (tonight)
I'm walking on air
I'm walking, I'm walking on air (tonight)
I'm walking on air
I'm walking on air (tonight)
I'm walking on air
I'm walking, I'm walking on air (tonight)
I'm walking on air
I'm walking on air
This is pure paradise,
Even heaven is jealous of our love
Yes, we make angels cry,
Raining down on earth from up above
Just when I think I can't take anymore
We go deeper and harder than ever before
We go higher and higher
I feel like I'm already there
I'm walking on air (tonight)
I'm walking on air
I'm walking, I'm walking on air (tonight)

Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air
I'm walking on air
Under a silver moon, tropical temperature
I feel my lotus bloom, come closer
I want your energy, I want your aura
You are my destiny, my mantra
Never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your life
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical, tonight (oh, oh)
Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum
Legendary lovers, we could be legendary
Legendary lovers, we should be legendary
Go down in history
Go down together, into infinity, forever
You're Cleopatra
You're blushing Juliet
Anything for your love, a ride or die
Never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your life
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical, tonight (oh, oh)
Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum
Legendary lovers, we could be legendary
Legendary lovers, we should be legendary
Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum
Legendary lovers, we could be legendary
Legendary lovers, we should be legendary
Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum
Legendary lovers, we could be legendary
Legendary lovers, we should be legendary
You send a text
It's like the wind changed your mind
We were best friends
Yeah, we were burning our lives
With every kiss, and every letter
Every promise of forever, oh
But you hit send
And disappeared in front of my eyes
And now you're just a ghost
When I look back never would have known that
You could be so cold
Like a stranger vanish like a vapor
There's just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision's 20/20
I see through you now
Something is tight
Now that I have made up my mind
I'll be alright
It doesn't harm me at night
'Cause every gift, every letter, every promise of forever
Now, it's out of sight
Like you were never alive
And now you're just a ghost
When I look back never would have known that
You could be so cold
Like a stranger vanish like a vapor
There's just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision's 20/20
I see through you now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now
So rest in piece
I see you on the other side
And now you're just a ghost
When I look back never would have known that
You could be so cold
Like a stranger vanish like a vapor
There's just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision's 20/20
I see through you now, now, now, now, now
Oh, now, now, now, now, now
I see through you now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now
I see through you now
He put it on me, I put it on,
Like there was nothing wrong
It didn't fit,
It wasn't right
Wasn't just the size
They say you know,
When you know
I don't know
I didn't feel
The fairytale feeling, no
Am I a stupid girl
For even dreaming that I could
If it's not like the movies,
That's how it should be, yeah
When he's the one,
I'll come undone,
And my world will stop spinning
And that's just the beginning, yeah
Snow white said when I was young,
"One day my prince will come"
So I wait for that date
They say its hard to meet your match,
Find my better half
So we make perfect shapes
If stars don't align,
If it doesn't stop time,
If you cant see the sign,
Wait for it
One hundred percent,
With every penny spent
He'll be the one that,
Finishes your sentences
If it's not like the movies,
That's how it should be
When he's the one,
And my world will stop spinning,
And that's just the beginning
Oh yeah,
Cause I know you're out there,
And your, your looking for me
It's a crazy idea that you were made,
Perfectly for me you'll see
Just like the movies
That's how it will be
Oh but that's how it should be
Cinematic and dramatic with the perfect ending
Oh it's not like the movies,
Oh but that's how it should be
When he's the one,
You'll come undone,
And your world will stop spinning,
And it's just the beginning
I lost myself in fear of losing you
I wish I didn't do, but I did
I lost my own, my own identity
Forgot that you picked me, for me
But now, I don't negotiate with insecurities
They always seem to get the best of me
I found I had to love myself, the way I want you to
Love me, no more second guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining who I'm gonna be
No concealing feelings, or changing seasonally
I'm gonna love myself, the way I want you to love me
Sometimes I wish my skin was a costume
That I could just unzip, and strip
But who I am is who I'm meant to be
And it's who you are in love, in love with
So now, I don't negotiate with insecurities
You're gonna have to take a back seat
I know I have to love myself, the way I want you to
Love me, no more second guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining who I'm gonna be
No concealing feelings, or changing seasonally
I'm gonna love myself, the way I want you to love me
No more standing in my own way
Let's get deeper, let's get closer
No more standing in my own way
(I want you to love me)
No more standing in my own way
Let's get deeper, let's get closer
No more standing in my own way
(I want you to love me)
No more second guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining who I'm gonna be
No concealing my feelings, or changing seasonally
I'm gonna love myself, the way I want you to love me
No more second guessing
No, there's no more questioning
I'll be the one defining who I'm gonna be
No concealing feelings, or changing seasonally
I'm gonna love myself, the way I want you to love me
Yeah, eh yeah yeah
I can feel a phoenix inside of me,
As I march alone to a different beat,
Slowly slowing down my fear,
Yeah, yeah
I am ready for the road less traveled,
Suiting up for my crowning battle,
This test is my own cross to bare,
But I will get there
It's never easy to be chosen,
Never easy to be called,
Standing on the front line when the bombs start to fall,
I can see the Heavens,
But I still hear the flames calling out my name
I can see the writing on the wall,
I can't ignore this war,
At the end of it all,
Who am I living for?
I can feel this light that's inside of me,
Growing fast into a bolt of lightning,
I know one spark will shock the world,
Yeah, yeah
So I pray for favor like Esther,
I need Your strength to handle the pressure,
I know there will be sacrifice,
But that's the price
It's never easy to be chosen,
Never easy to be called,
Standing on the front line when the bombs start to fall,
I can see the Heavens,
But I still hear the flames calling out my name
I can see the writing on the wall,
I can't ignore this war,
At the end of it all,
Who am I living for?
I can see the writing on the wall,
I can't ignore this war,
At the end of it all,
Who am I living for?
At the end, at the end,
Who am I living for?
At the end, at the end,
Who am I living for?
Heavy is the head that wears the crown,
Don't let the greatness get you down
Heavy is the head that wears the crown,
Don't let the greatness get you down
Oh yeah
I can see the writing on the wall,
I can't ignore this war,
At the end of it all,
Who am I living for?
I can see the writing on the wall,
I can't ignore this war,
At the end of it all,
Who am I living for?
At the end, at the end,
Who am I living for?
At the end, at the end,
Who am I living for?
You are my hurt locker lover
Keep me walking on a wire
Don't know when you'll blow
So I tip toe through your triggered mine
You fight me but I'm on your side
Defeated, now retreating
Why you trying to make me your enemy
All I really need is a little peace
I just wanna be your lover
Oh, this is not a competition
So baby why the ammunition
I don't wanna be the last one standing
Choose your battles, babe
Then you win the war
Stop digging your own grave
There's so much to live for
Choose your battles, babe
'Cause I'm not fighting anymore
I am not fighting anymore
I try to pick off your red flags
But dancing up on broken glass
Your mind games hit like glue names
Your course just like the Kennedys
But you somehow get me on my knees, defeated
Not retreated
Why you trying to make me your enemy
All I really need is a little peace
I just wanna be your lover
Oh, this is not a competition
So baby why the ammunition
I don't wanna be the last one standing
Choose your battles, babe
Then you win the war
Stop digging your own grave
Within, so much to live for
Choose your battles, babe
'Cause I'm not fighting anymore, no
I am not fighting anymore
If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay then stay
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more, baby
I am not fighting anymore
If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay then stay
I don't wanna fight no more
Anyway, I am not fighting anymore
If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay then stay
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more, baby
If you wanna go, then go (choose your battle babe)
If you wanna stay then stay (then you win the war)
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more, baby (stop digging your own grave)
If you wanna go, then go (choose your battle babe)
If you wanna stay then stay (then you win the war)
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more, baby
I leave the gas on, walk the alleys in the dark
Sleep with candles burning, I leave the door unlocked
I'm weaving a rope and running all the red lights
Did I get your attention? 'Cause I'm sending all the signs
That the clock is ticking and I'll be giving my two weeks
Pick your favorite shade of black you'd best prepare a speech
Say something funny, say something sweet
But don't say that you loved me
I'm still breathing
But we've been dead for a while
This sickness has no cure, we're going down for sure
Already lost our grip, best abandon ship, oh
Maybe I was too pale, maybe I was too fat
Maybe you had better, better luck in the sack
No formal education, I swore way too much
I swear you didn't care 'cause we were in love
So as I write this letter and shed my last tear
Know it's all for the better that we end this here
Let's close this chapter, say one last prayer
But don't say that you loved me
I'm still breathing
But we've been dead for awhile
This sickness has no cure, we're going down for sure
Oh we've been diagnosed, so let's give up the ghost
'Cause I'm still breathing
But we've been dead for a while
This sickness has no cure, we're going down for sure
Already lost our grip, best abandon ship, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
Oh
Is Mercury in retrograde or is that the excuse that I've always made
'Cause I wanna blame you
But I can only blame myself
Yeah, it's easy to throw you under the bus
I'll call you crazy, while I'm filling my cup
I say these things to hurt you
But I only hurt myself
Oh, I can only take responsibility for me
It takes two, two sides to every story
Not just you
I can't keep ignoring
I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, oh yeah
It takes two, two sides to every story
Not just me
You can't keep ignoring
But let me be first baby to say I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
I face my demons, yeah, I paid my dues
I had to grow up, I wish you could too
I wanted to save you, but I can only save myself
Oh, I can only be the change you want to see
Yeah, to see
It takes two, two sides to every story
Not just you
I can't keep ignoring
I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, oh yeah
It takes two, two sides to every story
Not just me
You can't keep ignoring
But let me be first baby to say I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
I point my finger but it does me no good
I look in the mirror and it tells me the truth, yeah
Why all these lessons always learned the hard way
Is it too late to change
It takes two, two sides to every story
Not just you
I can't keep ignoring
I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, oh
It takes two, two sides to every story
Not just me
You can't keep ignoring
But let me be first baby to say I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
Flowers in her hair, she don't care
Peach pink lips, yeah, everybody stares
You think you've seen her in a magazine
It's like she walked right out of your dreams
Black ray-bans, you know she's with the band
Passport stamps, she's cosmopolitan
Yeah, she runs the place like Penny lane
Yeah you lucky if you're on her plane
From Tokyo, to Mexico, to Rio
That girl's a trip, a one way ticket
Takes you miles high, so high,
'Cause she's got that one international smile
Catch her if you can
Yeah, she's so in demand
Takes you miles high, so high,
'Cause she's got that one international smile
She's got that, je ne sais quoi, you know it
So trÃ¨s chic, yeah, she's a classic
But she's footloose and so fancy free
Yeah, she dances to her own beat
'Cause she's the muse and the artist
Always leaves a trail of stardust
'Cause she's a little bit of Yoko,
And she's a little bit a, oh no
From LA, Miami, to New York City
That girl's a trip, a one way ticket
Takes you miles high, so high,
'Cause she's got that one international smile
Catch her if you can
Yeah, she's so in demand
Takes you miles high, so high,
'Cause she's got that one international smile
Please fasten your seatbelts
And make sure your champagne glasses are empty
We are now approaching the runway
So get ready for take off

Takes you miles high, so high
'Cause she's got that one international smile
Catch her if you can
Yeah, she's so in demand
Takes you miles high, so high,
'Cause she's got that one international smile
You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
Yeah you, PMS
Like a bitch
I would know
And you over think
Always speak
Cryptically
I should know
That you're no good for me
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really want to stay, no
(You) But you don't really want to go-o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
We used to be
Just like twins
So in sync
The same energy
Now's a dead battery
Used to laugh bout nothing
Now you're plain boring
I should know that
You're not gonna change
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really want to stay, no
(You) But you don't really want to go-o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bi-polar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride
You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really want to stay, no
(You) But you don't really want to go-o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down, down.
I saw a spider, I didn't scream
'Cause I can belch the alphabet, just double dog dare me
And I chose guitar over ballet
And I'd take these suckers down 'cause they just get in my way
The way you look at me
Is kinda like a little sister
You high five your goodbyes
And it leaves me nothing but blisters
So I don't wanna be one of the boys, one of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be one of the girls
Pretty in pearls and not one of the boys
So over the summer something changed
I started reading Seventeen and shaving my legs
And I studied Lolita religiously
And I walked right into school and caught you staring at me
'Cause I know what you know
But now you're gonna have to take a number
It's okay, maybe one day
But not until you give me my diamond ring
'Cause I don't wanna be one of the boys, one of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be your homecoming queen
Pin-up poster dream, not one of the boys
I wanna be a flower, not a dirty weed
I wanna smell like roses, not a baseball team
And I swear maybe one day
You're gonna wanna make out, make out, make out with me
Don't wanna be, don't wanna be, don't wanna be
'Cause I don't wanna be one of the boys, one of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be one of the girls
Pretty in pearls and not one of the boys
There's a stranger in my bed,
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbie's on the barbeque
This a hickey or a bruise?
( Pre-Chorus )
Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well
It's a blacked out blur
But I'm pretty sure
It ruled
Damn
( Chorus )
Last Friday night
Yeah we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a menage a trois
Last Friday night
Yeah I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop op, whoa
This Friday night
Do it all again
This Friday night
Do it all again
Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrants out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail
( pre-chorus )
Pictures of last night

This Friday night
Do it all again
You're a one of a one
A one of a kind
That you only find once in a lifetime
Made to fit like a fingerprint
A code that clicks open a gold mine
They say one man's trash is another man's treasure
When I found you, it was all pretty better
Secretly, I hit the lottery 'cause you're
Brighter than all of the Northern the Lights
You speak to me, even in my dreams, wouldn't
Let you go for even the highest price
They say one man's trash is another girl's treasure
So if it's up to me, I'm gonna keep you forever
'Cause I understand you,
We see eye to eye
Like a double rainbow
In the sky
And wherever you go
So will I
'Cause a double rainbow
Is hard to find
Was a phenomenon when you came along, yeah
Chemistry was more than science
It was deafening, loud like
lightning, it was striking, you couldn't deny it
They say one man's trash is another man's treasure
The two of us together, make everything glitter
'Cause I understand you,
We see eye to eye
Like a double rainbow
In the sky
And wherever you go
So will I
'Cause a double rainbow
Is hard to find
To the bottom of the sea, I'd go to find you
Climb the highest peak to be right beside you
Every step I take, I'm keeping you in mind
(Ooh ooh ooh)
'Cause I understand you,
We see eye to eye
Like a double rainbow
In the sky
And wherever you go (I go up for you)
So will I
'Cause a double rainbow
Is hard to find
It's hard to find
Oh it's hard to find
Once in a lifetime ah
Once in a lifetime
Once in a lifetime
You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil?
Could you be an angel?
Your touch magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing
They say be afraid
You're not like the others
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you
You're from a whole other world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch are foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial
You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers
Stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic
You're from a whole other world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch are foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial
There is this transcendental
On another level
Boy, you're my lucky star
I wanna walk on your wave length
And be there when you vibrate
For you I'll risk it all, all
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch are foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch are foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial
Lay me down at your altar, baby
I'm a slave to this luck
Your electric lips have got me speaking in tales
I have prayed for a power like you
To see deep down in my soul
Oh, you make me bloom like a flower at desert road
Magic, or one, or mystery
All of you trying to work on me
I would surrender myself
Holy hell, and heaven high
You will open up my eyes
And I'm finally here
This is spiritual, under your spell
Phenomenon, the way you make me feel
Like an angel, oh, at blow
Like a feather, you make me float
Love you crazy kite on your left
Lost in sweet ecstasy
Found a nirvana finally
Magic, or one, or mystery
All of you trying to work on me
I would surrender myself
Holy hell, and heaven high
You will open up my eyes
And I am finally here
This is spiritual, under your spell
Phenomenon, the way you make me feel
Like an angel, oh, at blow
Like a feather, you make me float
(You make me float, you make me float)
This is spiritual, under your spell
So phenomenon, the way you make me feel
Like an angel, oh, at blow
Like a feather, you make me float
(You make me float, oh, you make me float)
[Intro]
Oh, when we go numb
Oh, when we come down
High up on this chasin', hardly moving but it feels right
[Verse 1]
Drift away
The haze slows down the pulse
Latency
A mind of cruise control
[Pre-Chorus]
What you want?
What you need?
Well I'll give you all or nothing
What you want?
What you need?
Is what I've got, trust me
[Chorus]
Static, static, static, moves, oh
Static, static, stuck on you
Static, static, moves, oh, oh
[Verse 2]
We escape
We're lying on the moon
Stay awake
To see the naked truth
[Pre-Chorus]
What you want?
What you need?
Well I'll give you all or nothing
What you want?
What you need?
Is what I've got, trust me
[Chorus]
Static, static, static, moves, oh
Static, static, stuck on you
Static, static, moves, oh, oh
[Bridge]
Oh, when we go numb
Oh, when we come down
High up on this chasin', hardly moving but it feels right
[Chorus]
Static, static, static, moves, oh
Static, static, stuck on you
Static, static, moves, oh, oh

Every day is a holiday
(ever day now!)
When you're the reason to celebrate
Every day is a holiday
(you're the reason baby!)
When you're the reason
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason to celebrate
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason
We don't need a thing
Under the tree
You're giving me
All I need
Every day is a holiday (holiday)
When you're the reason to celebrate
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason to celebrate (the reason)
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason, you are the reason
(Reason, reason, reason)
Every day is a holiday (every day now)
When you're the reason to celebrate (you're the reason, baby)
Every day is a holiday (oh)
When you're the reason, when you're the reason (whoo!)
Every day is a holiday (holiday)
When you're the reason to celebrate (you're the reason, baby)
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason
If you want me
The cherry on top
The pick of the pack
The crÃ©me de la crop
If you want me you better do better than that tonight
Oh oh
If you want me
It takes more than a wink
More than a drink
More than you think
If you want me you're gonna have to break the bank tonight
Cause some don't have the patience
Some call me high maintenance
But you pay the bill
Cause that's the deal
(Chorus)
If you wanna ride
Just name your price
Dont play cheap with your heart
Dont make a bet
If you cant write the check
For me, for me
Cause I can be bought but youll pay the cost
If you can afford me
If you want me
Im not a piece of ass
A one night stand
A storage shed
I think you better walk by tonight
Oh no
If you want me
Then stop begging
I dont put out for charity
If you want me theres no discount price
Tonight
But I dont need your dollar bills
I just want something real
Cause nothing's free
Except loving me
(Chorus)
If you want me
The cherry on top
The pick of the pack
The crme de la crop
(Chorus) x2
She is a pyramid
But with him she's just a grain of sand
This love's too strong like mice and men
Squeezing out the life that should be let in
She was a hurricane-cane-cane-cane
But now she's just a gust of wind
She used to set the sails of a thousand ships
Was a force to be reckoned with
She could be a Statue of Liberty
She could be a Joan of Arc
But he's scared of the light that's inside of her
So he keeps her in the dark
Oh, she used to be a pearl, oh
Yeah, she used to rule the world, oh
Can't believe she's become a shell of herself
'Cause she used to be a pearl
She was unstoppable
Moved fast as light, like an avalanche
But now she's stuck deep in cement
Wishing that they'd never ever met
She could be a Statue of Liberty
She could be a Joan of Arc
But he's scared of the light that's inside of her
So he keeps her in the dark
Oh, she used to be a pearl, oh
Yeah, she used to rule the world, oh
Can't believe she's become a shell of herself
'Cause she used to be a
Do you know that there's a way out,
There's a way out
There's a way out
There's a way out
You don't have to be held down,
Be held down
Be held down
Be held down
'Cause I used to be a shell
Yeah, I let him rule my world
My world, oh, yeah
But I woke up and grew strong
And I can still go on
And no one can take my pearl
You don't have to be shell, no
You're the one that rules your world, oh
You are strong and you'll learn
That you can still go on
And you'll always be a pearl
She is unstoppable
Remember when I dove into the crowd
And I got a bloody knee under my skin
A mark from wiping out
It brings back the memories
Every bone's been broken
But my heart is still wide open
I can't stop, don't care if I lose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted to
With each scar there's a map
That tells a story, what a souvenir of
Young love's like jumping out an airplane
Riding a tidal wave on an ocean of emotion
My heart rips me wide open
I can't stop, don't care if I lose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted to
And I cover up these scars
We'll make it, we'll make it but we break it
And I can't stop seeing stars
Let's hope not die whenever you're around
Around
I can't stop, don't care if I lose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Oh, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted to, oh
No, I can't stop
Oh, I can't stop
No, I can't stop
And I'm going out in flames
Oh, I'm going down in flames
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
Summer after high school, when we first met
We make-out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you
In another life, I would be your girl
We keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
I was June and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse
In another life, I would be your girl
We keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
The one, the one, the one
The one that got away
All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should'a told you what you meant to me, whoa
Cause now I pay the price
In another life, I would be your girl
We keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
The one (the one)
The one (the one)
The one (the one)
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
Under a silver moon, tropical temperature
I feel my lotus bloom, come closer
I want your energy, I want your aura
You are my destiny, my mantra
Never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your life
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical, tonight (oh, oh)
Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum
Legendary lovers, we could be legendary
Legendary lovers, we should be legendary
Go down in history
Go down together, into infinity, forever
You're Cleopatra
You're blushing Juliet
Anything for your love, a ride or die
Never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your life
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical, tonight (oh, oh)
Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum
Legendary lovers, we could be legendary
Legendary lovers, we should be legendary
Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum
Legendary lovers, we could be legendary
Legendary lovers, we should be legendary
Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum
Legendary lovers, we could be legendary
Legendary lovers, we should be legendary
Voted most likely to end up on the back OK a milk box drink
Looks like I'm letting them down
'Cause seven, seventy-five isn't worth and hour of my hard work and time
When you cant afford half the shit they advertise
Oh I'm worth more then they ask more then the two-tag generation full of regret
Oh I won't settle no, oh I can't settle
I wanna break the mold, I wanna break the stereotype
Fist in the air I'm not going down with out a fight
It's my life
And I'm sitting on the sidelines watching
It pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints on you
Representing you and me
Don't you wanna go down in history?
Rather then end up begging on the streets
Trading under table favors for a place to sleep
'Cause I'm worth more then this so stop writing prescriptions for my Ritalin
I can't focus my attention
I wanna break the mold, I wanna break the stereotype
Fist in the air I'm not going down with out a fight
It's my life
And I'm sitting on the sidelines watching
It pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints
Don't give up
Don't give in
Because your arms on the rock
Oh I'm not innocent, innocent, innocent, innocent
Effortless and I'm sitting on the sidelines watching
It pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
(I want you to remember me)
Effortless and I'm sitting on the sidelines watching
It pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
'Cause I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints, in the end
I'm out on my own again
Face down in the porcelain
Feeling so high but looking so low
Party favors on the floor
Group of girls banging on the door
So many new fair-weather friends
Oh oh oh, have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost?
Caught in the eye of a hurricane
Slowly waving goodbye like a pageant parade
So sick of this town pulling me down, oh
My mother says I should come back home
But can't find the way 'cause the way is gone
So if I pray am I just sending words into outer space?
Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost?
Another night waiting for someone to take me home
Have you ever been so lost?
Is there a light, is there a light
At the end of the road?
I'm pushing everyone away
'Cause I can't feel this anymore
Can't feel this anymore
Have you ever been so lost?
Know the way and still so lost?
Another night waiting for someone to take me home
Have you ever been so lost?
Have you ever been so lost?
How do I get closer to you
When you keep it all on mute?
How will I know the right way to love you?
Usually the queen of figuring out
Breaking down a man is no work out
But I have no clue
How to get through to you
Oh, I wanna hit you just to see if you cry
I keep knocking on wood
Hoping there's a real boy inside
'Cause you're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a man
I wish I could just turn you on
Put a battery in and make you talk
Even pull a string for you to say anything
But with you there is no guarantee
Only expired warranty
A bunch of broken parts
And I can't seem to find your heart
Oh, I'm such a fool, I'm such a fool, I'm such a fool
This one's outta my hands
I can't put you back together again
'Cause you're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a man
You're just a toy
Could you ever be a real, real boy
And understand?
But you're not a man
If the past is the problem
Our future could solve them, baby
I could bring you to life if you let me inside, baby
It will hurt but in the end you'll be a man
You're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
You're a toy
Could you ever be a real, real boy
And understand?
But you're not a man
You're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a man
Saucer of milk
Table for two
You wanna pet my kitty
You're such a dirty doggy.
It's your lucky night
'Cause Im in the mood
Oh, I'm feeling spicy
I'm feeling real naughty.
Pick a part, you dream it up.
A dark vixen, a Lolita.
Oh boy, tell me your fantasy,
Tonight's the night, I'm dressin' up for you.
I can tell you're obsessed
By your shortness of breath.
Ooh, my cookie monster
Wants a taste test.
Be a good boy
And I'll show you the rest
Ooh, my little voyeur
Wants to play explorer.
Pick a part, you dream it up.
Librarian, dominatrix.
Oh boy, tell me your fantasy,
Tonight's the night (Tonight's the night)
Tonight I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your
Nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you (dressin' up)
You're getting hot
So let's call the nurse
Ooh, I feel a fever
Let's take your temperature
Better Behave
Or a police officer
Will have to hold you down
Give you what you deserve
Pick a part, you dream it up.
Use your imagination
Oh boy, I'll be your fantasy,
Tonight's the night (Tonight's the night)
Tonight I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your
Nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise

Make you forget about your
Nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you (dressin' up)
Tide
Tight
Tip
Teasing
Push
Pull
Pressure
Pleasing
Beads of sweat drip down your neck
Breathing deep, gaining speed, about to peak
Trembling
Trembling
Trembling
Tonight I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your
Nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you (dressin' up)
Tonight I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your
Nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you (dressin' up)
Dressin' up
I'm dressin' up for you
I'm dressin' up x5
For you
I'm dressin' up
I'm dressin' up for you
Once upon a time
Yeah I was in the dark
I was in your sight, with an open heart
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care
And now it's clear to me
And when I fell hard
You took a step back
Without me, (Yeah, I was dreaming for so long) , without me, without me
I wish I knew then
And he's long gone
Wouldn't dive in
When he's next to me
Gravity hurts
And I realize
('Till I woke up on)
On the concrete
Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I've never been
'Till you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I've never been
Now I'm lying on the cold (On the concrete) hard ground
Oh, oh, (I'm Wide Awake) trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, (I'm Wide Awake) trouble, trouble, trouble
No apologies
Not losing any sleep
Pretend he doesn't know
That he's the reason why
Im wide awake,
Need nothing to complete myself
You're drowning, you're drowning, (Nooo) you're drowning
And I heard you moved on
Yeah, I am born again
Out of the lion's den
I don't have to pretend
And now I see, now I see, (The end) now I see
I wish I knew then
And he's long gone
Wouldn't dive in
When he's next to me
Gravity hurts
And I realize
('Till I woke up)
The joke is on me
Falling from cloud 9
[It was out of the blue when]
Crashing from the height
Im letting go tonight
[Yeah Im living a cold world]
Im falling from cloud 9
(Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground)
Oh, oh, (I'm Wide Awake) trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, (I'm Wide Awake) trouble, trouble, trouble
Then the saddest fear,(Crumbling) comes creeping in, (Crumbling)
Im wide awake
That you never loved me,
Or her, (Im wide awake) or anyone, (Im wide awake) or anything
Yeah-eah! (Im wide awake)
Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now, (Im wide awake)
Flew me to places I've never been
'Till you put me down oh, (Im wide awake)
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now, (Im wide awake)
Flew me to places I've never been (Then I woke up)
Now I'm lying on the (On the concrete) cold hard ground
Falling from cloud 9 (trouble, trouble, trouble)
Crashing from the height (trouble, trouble, trouble)
Im letting go tonight (trouble, trouble, trouble)
Im falling from cloud 9 (trouble, trouble, trouble)
Trouble,
Im wide awake
I used to know you when we were young
You were in all my dreams
We sat together in period one
Fridays at 8:15
Now I see your face in the strangest places
Movies and magazines
I saw you talkin' to Christopher Walken
On my TV screen
I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you
I used to work in a record store
Now I work for my dad
Scraping the paint off the hard wood floors
The hours are pretty bad
Sometimes I wonder where you are
Probably in L.A.
That seems to be where everybody else ends up these days
I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you
I'm used to opening my own doors and splitting the checks
He introduced me, was always just a friend
I bought a new dress, he never noticed
Always falling for these bad boys, such a challenge
I'm getting tired of cleaning up after them
I think I'm ready to be a woman
Oh love, I think I'm ready, ready for it
You were such a surprise, an unexpected gift
Said I was pretty and I believed it
Not really used to all this attention
Told myself I don't deserve you and this is just a phase
Could I get used to being loved the right way?
I wanna argue but there is nothing to say
Oh love, I think I'm ready, ready for it
Ready for it
Oh love, I think I'm ready
Cause you send me flowers when there's no occasion
Yeah, we talk for hours, you still wanna listen
Won't hold it against me if I just need you to hold me tonight
My mother always told me that you'd show up one day
So scared to feel this way
But love, I think I'm ready, ready for it
Ready for it
Oh love, I think I'm ready, ready for it
Ready for it
Oh love, I think I'm ready
The owl and the pussy cat went to sea in a beautiful pea green boat they took some honey and plenty of money wrapped up in a five pound note. The owl looked up to the stars above, and sang from a small guitar, oh lovely pussy oh pussy my love, what a beautiful pussy you are you are what a beautiful pussy you are. so they sailed away for a year and a day to the land where the palm trees grow, and there in a wood a piggy wig stood with a ring on the end of his nose his nose a ring on the end of his nose. dear pig are you willing to sell for one shilling your ring? said the piggy i will. so they took it away and were married nest day by the turkey who lived on the hill. the dined on mince and slices of quince which they ate with an runcible spoon and hand in hand by the edge of the sand they dance in the light of the moon the moon they danced in the light of the moon.
Ke$ha:
Wake up in the mornin' feelin' like P- Diddy (Hey what's up girl)
Grab ma glasses I'm out the door I'm gonna hit the city (Let's go)
Before I leave brush ma teeth with a bottle of Jack
'Cuz when I leave for the night I ain't comin back

Katy Perry:
I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sippin' gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees
The boys
Break their necks
Try'na to creep a little sneak peek
(at us)
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close
to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oooooh Oh Oooooh
California girls
We're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes
Bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin
So hot

Now put your hands up
Oooooh Oh Oooooh
Justin Bieber:
Oh woooah, oh woooooah, oh wooooah, oh.
You know you love me, I know you care,
you shout whenever and I'll be there.
You are my love, you are my heart
and we will never ever ever be apart.
Are we an item? girl quit playing,
we're just friends, what are you saying.
Said there's another, look right in my eyes,
my first love broke my heart for the first time.
And I was like...
[Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby oooooh,
like baby, baby, baby noooooooo,
like baby, baby, baby, ooooh.
Thought you'd always be mine, mine (repeat)
Milk milk lemonade round the back's where chocolates made. 4x
I know you're thirsty baby standing in the heat.
I got the juicy fruit; the sweet peaches and cream
You wanna wet your whistle, come and have a drink. (Ice cold)
Cool as a cucumber, you're coming on to me.
You say I got the ripest melons on the street.
My honey dew and your banana make a treat.
Cause baby don't you know all the boys are jelly of you?
(The first comes, first serve)
Don't you know that it's so delicious, yummy, and new?
(The first comes, first serve)
So bottoms up!
Milk milk lemonade round the back's where chocolates made. 4x
You'll have to cut your calories when you're with me.
Because my sugar gonna give you cavities.
Don't wanna share me cause I'm such a tasty treat.
(Yum yum)
I'll let you double dip it in your favorite sauce.
I'll even let you eat the cherry on the top.
You'll beg for seconds in a diabetic shock.
(What?)
Cause baby don't you know all the boys are jelly of you?
(The first comes, first serve)
Don't you know that it's so delicious, yummy, and new?
(The first comes, first serve)
So bottoms up!
Milk milk lemonade round the back's where chocolates made. 4x
Open 24-hours, more than 31 flavors to satisfy your craving.
I know you're sick of the Kool-Aid; I've got an upgrade.
One sip you'll be salivating.
Milk milk lemonade round the back's where chocolates made. 5x
(That's more like it, That's more like it)
(That's more like it, That's more like it)
When I wanted you, you would not reciprocate
When I needed you, you would always show up late
But things have changed, and I've got the upper hand
You can run and I've got you eating out of my hand
[Chorus]
That's more like it, yeah
That's more like it
Make my dinner and bring it to me
That's more like it, That's more like it
Yeah, That's more like it
Yeah, That's more like it
Get to work and give me money.
That's more like it!
When my birthday came, you would not remember it
When I got my period, you were inconsiderate.
But tables turn, and it's great to be on top
Got you great to appreciate the good that you've got
[Chorus]
That's more like it, yeah
That's more like it
I say where and when it happens.
That's more like it, That's more like it
Yeah, That's more like it
Yeah, That's more like it
It's great to be the last one laughing.
That's more like it!
[Bridge]
I like chocolate
And I like daisies
Maybe you better write this down
I love cashmere, and I want diamonds
Ready for my massage right now
[Chorus]
That's more like it, yeah
That's more like it
Make my dinner and bring it to me
That's more like it, That's more like it
Yeah, That's more like it
Yeah, it's about time.
You get to work and bring me money.
That's more like it!
(That's more like it, That's more like it)
(That's more like it, That's more like it)
If the fish swam out of the ocean
And grew legs and they started walking
And the apes climbed down from the trees
And grew tall and they started talking
And the stars fell out of the sky
And my tears rolled into the ocean
Now I'm looking for a reason why
You even set my world into motion
'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
That it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really here
Then I don't wanna be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold
I looked up into the gray sky
And see a thousand eyes staring back
And all around these golden beacons
I see nothing but black
I feel the weight of something beyond them
I don't see what I can feel
If vision is the only validation
Then most of my life isn't real
'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
That it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really here
Then I don't wanna be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold
'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
That it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really here
Then I don't wanna be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold
Black and gold, black and gold
Black and gold, black and gold
You're such a poet
I wish I could be Wesley Willis
My words would flow like honey
Sweet and laid on thick
You're so edgy
You don't even need a rhyming dictionary
I wipe my hands on your jeans
'Cause they are more distressed
So they say, you've got OCD
And they claim you can barely read
But you say
"Don't bother me with all of your reality"
But it could be so simple
Life should be that simple
I wish it were just so simple
But the point's been missed
You've made a mess
Who would have guessed
That it's as simple as it seems
So what, you're a genius
But you've got a lot to learn
Like the time you lost your apartment
'Cause you bought too much Vuitton
You park in a loading zone
You sleep with the lights all on
You cross your I's and dot your T's
All it goes to show
That it could be so simple
Life should be that simple
I wish it were just that simple
Forget the point's been missed
We've made a mess
Who would have guessed
And it's as simple as it seems
I'm not saying that it's a piece of cake
Just take a moment to re-evaluate
The possibilities, the situations
The opportunities that are waiting
Oh, the possibilities, oh, I
It could, it could be that simple
Life should be that simple
I wish it were just so simple
You're in a haze
It's just a phase
You know this maze
Is as simple as it seems
We could talk all day
About your eccentricities
What I mean to say
Oh, is that I need you to listen please
And focus on, all life's simplicities
So don't be afraid to strip it away
'Cause at the end of the day
It's still as simple as it seems
It is all so simple
Just deal with it
How could I see you when I was so blind
How could I grasp you when I was far behind
How could I hear you when I was so deaf
How could I get up when I had been left
But You said, "don't worry"
For I've healed the blind man
And I've set the captives free
And You said, "don't worry"
For all you've gotta do
Is put your trust in Me
How could I be clean when I was so dirty
How could I be made whole when I was torn apart
Make me whole, make me whole
Make me whole again
You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
Yeah you, PMS
Like a bitch
I would know
And you over think
Always speak
Cryptically
I should know
That you're no good for me
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really want to stay, no
(You) But you don't really want to go-o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
We used to be
Just like twins
So in sync
The same energy
Now's a dead battery
Used to laugh bout nothing
Now you're plain boring
I should know that
You're not gonna change
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really want to stay, no
(You) But you don't really want to go-o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bi-polar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride
You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really want to stay, no
(You) But you don't really want to go-o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down, down.
Oh my god were you looking at her butt?
You're such a good boy and let's keep it the way
You're going out with your guys tonight
and you can flirt, boy, shut the window displays
they'll get you drunk, misbehave alright? Alright!
Yeah.. I let you walk the line 'cause you come home every time and I won't never give you reasons not to
You're such a good boy and let's keep it the way
yeah, let's keep it the way
Chorus:
You can look, but you can't touch
You can look, don't touch (don't touch), you can look but you can't touch ( aaaaaah)
You can look, but you can't touch, you can look at her butt (her butt)
You can look, but you can't touch her butt (aaaaah)
Dont touch! Don't even think about it!
I'll be your bad girl, when you came later tonight, I can treat you and feed your appetite
You wouldn't dare leave me home alone too long and get me thinking something's really wrong
Yeah, I'll let it you draw my line, you'll be the captain every time
I'll let you think you're in control of this
You're such a good a boy and let's keep it the way
yeah, let's keep it the way
chorus 4
You can look, but you can't touch
You can look, don't touch (don't touch), you can look but you can't touch ( aaaaaah)
You can look, but you can't touch, you can look at her butt (her butt)
You can look, but you can't touch her butt (aaaaah)
Dont touch! Don't even think about it!
Im only saying baby
You can look, but you can't touch her butt (what?)
I saw you looking at her butt, it's a J E L L O
You say you get me another drink, but I saw you say hello
You think I'm blind, you think I'm deaf, and you think that I'm dumb
I aint your Helen Keller, honey !
I'm your number one
Don't you forget
Punk
Chorus 4
You can look, but you can't touch
You can look, don't touch (don't touch), you can look but you can't touch ( aaaaaah)
You can look, but you can't touch, you can look at her butt (her butt)
You can look, but you can't touch her butt (aaaaah)
Dont touch! Don't even think about it!
Look, look, look! Don't touch, don't touch
I saw you at the grocery store
Oh, you both looked happy
Picking out the usual
She's a carbon copy
Of everything you lost
Of everything I'm not
I guess you just forgot
How to pick 'em
If she's the one I've heard about
I'm disappointed
If she's the reason why you left
I'm not impressed at all
Well, this looks like the end
Yeah, we can still be friends
Congratulations
Let me be the first
To wish you the worst
'Cause I think you
Deserve each other
Let me be the curse that creeps
Under your skin
Until your heart caves in
And you wish
She was me again
And again
And again
And again
Well, someone had to tell the truth
And I'm always honest
I read you like an open book
And it's obvious to me
She's just the one between
Heading no where fast
Sure, it's gonna last forever
Let me be the first
To wish you the worst
'Cause I think you
Deserve each other
Let me be the curse that creeps
Under your skin
Until your heart caves in
And you wish she was me
Let me be the first
To wish you the worst
'Cause I think you
Deserve each other
Let me be the curse that creeps
Under your skin
Until your heart caves in
And you wish she was me again
And again
And again
And again
Oh, you wish
You wish
You wish
You do
Got a call from my friend
She saw my picture again
In a magazine
We laughed out loud
'Cuz she said "remeber when...
This was all a silly dream?
Now I wake up every day
In a different city
A smile on my face
Somebody pinch me
She said "all the world's a satge"
But girl you know
Those cameras and lights
Won't ever change me
I don't drink champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We sip on tea on the porch
'Cuz I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour
I slip back into my jeans
'Cuz I'm still the girl next door
It's amazin' to hear people singin' along
Hear the radio playin' my song
I still get butterflies
Still get nervous inside
In the spotlight
Now every now n then
On a friday night
Cruisin' down to the dive bar
We waste the night away
Spend saturday sleepin' in late
Those were the good days
I don't drink champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We sip on tea on the porch
'Cuz I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour
I slip back into my jeans
'Cuz I'm still the girl next door
And even when I'm miles away
I'll always have the roots from where I came
Cuz when it all fades away
My home will still be the same
Yeah eh
Yeah...
I don't drink champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We sip on tea on the porch
'Cuz I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour
I slip back into my jeans
'Cuz I'm still the girl next door
I took advantage of you a stepping stone to my pedestal
When you had enough of it
I said fine good luck replacing this
Cause I seem strong and independent self sufficient, confident
and I'm like mercury rising to the top so selfishly
The better half of me was you
I'm like a hive without a bee without you
I gotta find ya gotta, remind ya
That two is better than one
So please accept my apology cause I'm feeling
like a branch without its tree
It took me a fall to really see
that your the catch I wanna keep
'Cause I get weak thinking about you
living without you life has no value
Baby come back to me
'Cause you're the only missing piece
'Cause the better half of me was you
I'm like the hive without its bee without you
I gotta find ya, gotta remind ya
That two is better than one
Ooh it took a little earthquake
To appreciate the stability you've given me
So consistently
The better half of me was you
I'm like a bird without its wings without you
I gotta find ya, gotta remind ya
That two is stronger than one
The better half of me, oh its you
I'm like a heart without its beat without you
I gotta find ya, gotta remind ya
I promise you that I'm gotta try to
I'm gonna love ya cause two is better than one
(Verse)
You hate the sand between your toes
I like the beach on a sunny day
I like pink margaritas, it appears you like beer
I like a foreign accent
You just say What? What the hell they say?
We got different perspectives
Night and day, but thats okay
(Chorus)
Sometimes I like to trade you in
For someone more like me
You tell me I was right again
We get on famously
Life would be boring without you to disagree
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Verse)
You like to fight in silence
I like to scream while Im breaking plates
You like the heavy metal
But I like songs to sing along to
(Chorus)
Sometimes I like to trade you in
For someone more like me
You tell me I was right again
We get on famously
Life would be boring without you to disagree
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Oh yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
(Bridge)
And I will, but you wont
And I do, but, but you dont
We wont budge either way
But we like it, we like it
(Chorus)
Sometimes I like to trade you in
For someone more like me
You tell me I was right again
We get on famously
Life would be boring without you to disagree
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Lets agree to disagree)
Yeah yeah yeah
(Dressin' up, dressin' up for you, for you, for you)
(Dressin' up, dressin' up for you, for you)
Saucer of milk, table for two
You wanna pet my kitty?
You're such a dirty doggy.
It's your lucky night 'cause I'm in the mood,
Oh, I'm feeling spicy, I'm feeling real naughty.
Pick a part, you dream it up.
A dark vixen, a Lolita.
Oh boy, tell me your fantasy,
Tonight I'm dressing up for you.
I can tell you're obsessed by your shortness of breath
Ooh, my cookie monster wants a taste test.
Be a good boy and I'll show you the rest
Ooh, my little voyeur wants to play explorer.
Pick a part, you dream it up.
Librarian, dominatrix.
Oh boy, tell me your fantasy,
Tonight's the night
Tonight I'm gonna come alive,
Make you forget about your 9 to 5,
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressing up for you.
You're getting hot, so let's call the nurse
Ooh, I feel a fever, let's take your temperature
Better behave, or a police officer will have to hold you down
Give you what you deserve
Pick a part, you dream it up.
Use your imagination
Oh boy, I'll be your fantasy,
Tonight's the night
Tonight I'm gonna come alive,
Make you forget about your 9 to 5,
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressing up for you.
Tonight I'm gonna come alive,
Make you forget about your 9 to 5,
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressing up for you.
Tied, tight, tip, teasing
Push, pull, pressure, pleasing
Beads of sweat drip down your neck,
Breathing deep, gaining speed, about to peak
Trembling, trembling, trembling
Tonight I'm gonna come alive,
Make you forget about your 9 to 5,
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressing up for you.
Tonight I'm gonna come alive,
Make you forget about your 9 to 5,
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressing up for you.
I'm dressin' up
I'm dressin' up for you
I'm dressin' up
I'm dressin' up
I'm dressin' up
I'm dressin' up
I'm dressin' up
For you
I'm dressin' up
I'm dressin' up for you
You would think that I could find a simple song, a photograph of mine
To show this public eye, what I have to offer
I may not have a PHD, or speak in eloquent philosophy!
I'm nothing more than simply me you see!
CHORUS(*1):
What I am trying to say
I'm just a babe in so many ways!
I'm still growing, still stretchin'
Still breaking in these new shoes
Looking for a way to make a mark of my own
I'm just a spring chick, wet behind the ears
It's a part of life so there's no need to fear
These growing pains that I'm going through
I don't regret, I'm not ashamed that I haven't yet begun to speaketh ways...
(As the wisest of men), oh perhaps some day
But for now I'm grateful to be a part of the family tree, while The Man upstairs does His work on me
It's a job that may take eternity to complete
CHORUS(*2):
Just when I've learned all I can, those growing
Pains up and kick on in again!
CHORUS
BRIDGE:
Time after time, one more time and again, will it ever end?
It's the lessons in our lives that make us wise
But young or old I am told it's the same
Oh, these growing pains never go away, so I'll just keep on trying
Music break
CHORUS(*1)
CHORUS

Josie's on a vacation far away
Come around and talk it over
So many things that I wanna say
You know I like my girls a little bit older
I just wanna use your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
I ain't got many friends left to talk to
Nowhere to run when I'm in trouble
You know I'd do anything for you
Stay the night but keep it under cover
I just wanna use your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
Try to stop my hands from shakin'
Somethin' in my mind's not makin' sense
It's been awhile since we've been all alone
I can't hide the way I'm feelin'
As you leave me please would you close the door
And don't forget what I told you
Just 'cause you're right that don't mean I'm wrong
Another shoulder to cry upon
I just wanna use your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
Yeah

I don't wanna lose your love tonight
I just wanna use your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

(Lose your love)
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
(Lose your love)
(Lose your love)
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
(Lose your love)
(Lose your love)
Tonight
I felt it
The wire touched my neck and
Then someone pulled it tighter
I never saw it coming
I started to black out and
Then someone said good morning
I took it as a warning
I should have seen it coming
So now I'll take a chance on
This thing we may have started
Intentional or not I
Don't think we saw it coming
It's all adding up to something
That asks for some involvement
That asks for a commitment
I think I see it coming
If we step out on that limb
My heart beat beats me senselessly
Why's everything got to be so intense with me?
I'm trying to handle all this unpredictability
In all probability
It's a long shot and I say why not
If I say forget it I know that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat the odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it
There's no chance
'Cause you're the best I've got
So take the long shot
I realize that there is all this doubting
Things we're both scared about but
We'll never see 'em coming
Throw caution to the wind and
We'll see which way it's blowing
And do this fully knowing
We'll never see it coming
'Til it's much too close to stop
My heart beat beats me senselessly
Why's everything got to be so intense with me?
I'm trying to handle all this unpredictability
And all probability
It's a long shot but I say why not
If I say forget it I know that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat the odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it
There's no chance
'Cause I'm the best you got
So take the long shot
What a pleasant surprise
What a breath of fresh air
You knock the wind out of me
Blindsided and so unaware
Aha, aha, aha
Oh, I waited for fact to come of fiction
And you fit my description
I never saw you coming
But we'll make it even though
It's a long shot but I say why not
If I say forget it, I know that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat the odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it
There's no chance
'Cause you're the best I got
So take the long shot
You didn't expect this
Oh, you never saw me coming
You didn't expect this
Oh, you never saw this coming
I take the long shot
I take the long shot
Shot, shot, shot, shot
'Cause you're the best I got
Oh, I'm take this chance on you, baby
I'm take this chance on you, baby
I'm taking this chance
