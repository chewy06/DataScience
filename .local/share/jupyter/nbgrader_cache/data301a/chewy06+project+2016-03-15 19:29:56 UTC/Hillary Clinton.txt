Re: Syria aiding Qaddafi
This memo has two parts. Part one is the report that Syria is providing air support for Qaddafi. Part two is a note
to Cody from Lord David Owen, former UK foreign secretary on his views of an increasingly complex crisis. It
seems that the situation is developing into a protracted civil war with various nations backing opposing sides
with unforeseen consequences. Under these circumstances the crucial challenge is to deprive Qaddafi of his
strategic depth—his support both financial and military.
I. Report
During the afternoon of March 3, advisers to Muammar Qaddafi stated privately that the Libyan
Leader has decided that civil war is inevitable, pitting troops and mercenary troops loyal to him
against the rebel forces gathering around Benghazi. Qaddafi is convinced that these rebels are
being supported by the United States, Western Europe and Israel. On March 2 Qaddafi told his
son Saif al-Islam that he believes the intelligence services of the United States, Great Britain,

Egypt, and France have deployed paramilitary officers to Benghazi to assist in organizing,
_raining, and equipping opposition forces. Qaddafi is convinced that the National Libyan Council
:NLC), and its leader, former Minister of Justice Mustafa Mohamed Abdel Gall have been
:thosen by the foreign powers to replace him. On March 1 advisors to Qaddafi stated that
Q,addafi's cousin, Col. Al Qaddafiddam had failed in efforts to recruit fighters among the
Egyptian population living immediately across the border with Libya.
These individuals added that during the week of February 21 the Libyan Leader spoke to Syrian
president Bashir al-Assad on at least three occasions by secure telephone lines. During the
:,onversations Qaddafi asked that Syrian officers and technicians currently training the Libyan
/kir Force be placed under command of the Libyan Army and allowed to fight against the rebel
tbrces.
(Source Comment: Senior Libyan Army officers still loyal to Qaddafi added that On February
23, President Assad told General Isam HaIlaq, the commander in chief of the Syrian Air Force,
:o instruct the pilots and technicians in Tripoli to help the Libyan regime, should full scale Civil
War breaks out in the immediate future.)
On March 2, a military officer with ties to Qaddfi's son Khamis stated privately that the number
Df Libyan pilots defecting to the opposition has destroyed the morale and professional spirit of
,he Libyan Air Force at this critical moment, when Tripoli's air superiority is its principal weapon
against insurgents. In the opinion of this individual Qaddafi and his senior military advisors are
convinced that the European Union and the U.S will impose a no-fly zone over Libya in the
immediate future. These advisors believe that the no fly zone will serve as air support for
Dpposition forces. They are also prepared for the Western allies to bomb anti-aircraft facilities in
and around Tripoli in preparation for the establishment of the no-fly zone. Foreign Minister
Mousa Kousa is convinced that that Russia and Turkey will oppose the move, and may prevent
the implementation of the no fly zone.
The Syrian soldiers in Libya are part of a mission established in 1984 following the signing of a
military agreement between Qaddafi and Syria's long-time ruler and Bashir's father, Hafez al-

SUBJECT: Libya (37)
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional
Council, as well as the highest levels of European Governments, and Western
Intelligence and security services.
THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION COMES FROM AN EXTREMELY
SENSITIVE SOURCE AND SHOULD BE HANDLED WITH CARE,
1. On September 12, 2012 Libyan President Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf
told senior advisors that the death of the U.S. Ambassador at the hands of Islamist
militia forces represents a threat to the future of the newly elected General National
Congress (GNC) Government. According to a sensitive source, el Magariaf
believes that the primary goal of this and other attacks on Western facilities is to
demonstrate that the GNC cannot protect its non-Islamic friends. Libyan security
officials believe that the attack was carried out by forces of the Islamist militia
group calling itself the Ansar al Sharia brigade; working out of camps in the
Eastern suburbs of Benghazi. These officials added that their sources indicate that
this group is led by former members of the old Libyan Islamic Fighting Group
(LIFG), some of whom are loyal to Islamist General Abclelhakim Belhaj. The
same officials were quick to point out that they have no evidence that Belhaj had
any direct involvement in this attack. They also have no direct information as to
whether this assault has anything to do with the death of Libyan born al Qai'da
leader Abu Yahya al- Libi, but they are pursuing this theme. These officials do

believe that the attackers having prepared to launch their assault took advantage of
the cover provided by the demonstrations in Benghazi protesting an internet
production seen as disrespectful to the prophet Mohammed.
2. According to this source, the immediate events were set in motion by a
statement made by a Muslim Cleric in Egypt saying that the interne film was
going to be shown across the United States on September 11 in an effort to insult
Muslims on the anniversary of the attacks on the New York World Trade Center in
2001. This statement inspired increasingly hostile demonstrations at the U.S.
Embassy in Cairo, and at diplomatic facilities in Libya. In Benghazi, reporting
from security sources states, approximately twenty one (21) Ansar al Sharia
fighters left their base in East Benghazi just after sundown infiltrated the crowd of
about 2,000 demonstrators at the U.S. Consulate. These forces, operating under
cover of darkness, opened fire on the consulate, eventually setting it on fire with
rocket propelled grenades. These fighters then withdrew to their camp. El
Magariaf ordered security officials to identify and arrest the attackers, adding that
he had been in touch with Egyptian President Mohmmed Morsi, and the two
agreed that their intelligence and security personnel will cooperate in this matter.
(Note: Some of the Libyan officials believe that the entire demonstration was
organized as cover for the attack, however; they point out that there is no evidence
of such a complex operation at this time.
3. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Libyan security
officers also informed el Magariaf that the attacks had been planned for
approximately one month, based on casing information obtained during an early
demonstration at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. The attackers were, in the
opinion of these individuals, looking for an opportunity to approach the consulate

under cover in a crowd. These officials add that government security officers
admitted to el Magariaf that they do not have the physical capacity to locate,
attack, and destroy the Ansar al-Sharia brigade, among others. They describe these
forces as well-trained, hardened killers; many of whom have spent time in
Afghanistan and Yemen. These fighters are located in camps in Eastern Libya; and
Libyan officials doubt they can penetrate these camps because the militia's are
better armed than the forces of the new National Army.
4. In the opinion of a separate source El Magariaf continues to believe that
the attacks were planned and carried out in a political atmosphere where a portion
of the Libyan population is focused on past cooperation between Western
intelligence and security services, and the regime of former dictator Muammar al
Qaddafi. According to this source, el Magariaf realizes that the death of the U.S.
Ambassador dictates that he must find tangible solutions to the problems tied to
disarming the militias, dealing Salafist violence against the followers of Sufi
beliefs, and efforts to discredit his government through linking him to Western
intelligence services. El Magariaf instructed his security officials to cooperate
with their U.S. counterparts. He also warned all of his advisors to be prepared for
U.S. retaliation against the suspected perpetrators of this attack, and the angry
public reaction that is sure to follow.
5. (Source Comment: A separate, particularly sensitive source added that in
private conversation el Magariaf stated that if his government cannot protect a
senior diplomatic official, foreign businesses will not be willing to risk opening up
new operations in Libya. According to this sensitive source, el Magariaf believes
that a number of the Islamist militias are now being influenced al Qai'da and other
radical groups; working out of camps in the Eastern and Southeastern parts of the

country. These groups are receiving aid and weapons from supporters in Sudan.
In the end, el Magariaf added that while he does not expect U.S. officials to focus
on this point, he believes the attacks against the interests and citizens of the U.S.
and other Western states are aimed first at overthrowing his government, and
replacing it with a strict Islamic Republic dominated by Salafist leaders. Magariaf
also warned that tribal militias loyal to the Qaddafi family continue to present an
equally dangerous threat to the new Government.)

Re: Magariaf and the attack on US in Libya
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as
well as the highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and
security services.
1. During the afternoon of September 11, 2012 new interim President of Libya
Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf spoke in private with senior advisors, including the
members of the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood, to discuss the attacks by demonstrators
on U.S. missions in Tripoli and Benghazi. According to a sensitive source, el Magariaf
was shaken by the attacks, and gave permission to commanders on the ground for
security forces to open fire over the heads of the crowds in an effort to break up mobs
attacking the missions. During this session, a senior security officer told el Magariaf
that the attacks on that day were inspired by what many devout Libyan viewed as a

sacrilegious internet video on the prophet Mohammed originating in America. The
Libyan attacks were also inspired by and linked to an attack on the U.S. mission in
Egypt on the same day. At the same time, el Magariaf noted in strong terms that the
atmosphere that made fostered these incidents in Libya is the product of widespread
publicity regarding the security situation in the country between 2004 and 2010 and
the cooperation that developed between a number of Western Intelligence services and
the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi.
2. This source added that el Magariafs advisors believe that this situation adds
to the President's growing concern over the unpredictable effects that will follow
current covert efforts by his political opponents to link him directly to foreign
intelligence services. According to a separate sensitive source, el Magariaf noted that
his opponents had often tried to connect him to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) through the National Front for the Salvation of Libya (NFSL), a group
established in opposition to former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi, which el Magariaf
led in the 1980s. In the opinion of this individual el Magariaf believes that he can
survive potential negative publicity in this regard, but if this situation continues to
develop in this manner it will complicate his efforts to establish an orderly
administration in the country. Again, he stated that the attacks on the U.S. missions
were as much a result of the atmosphere created by this campaign, as the controversial
internet video.
3. At the same time, this individual noted that several of el Magariafs advisors
share his concerns in this matter, pointing out that the return of Qaddafi's intelligence
chief Abdullah al-Seno-ussi for trial in Libya has heightened public interest in the
liaison relationships conducted by the CIA and British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS)
with Qaddfi's intelligence and security services. These same individuals note that they
believe Islamist militia forces under the command of General Abdelhaldm Belhaj
captured files and documents describing this relationship from Qaddafi's offices in
Tripoli. This fascination with Western intelligence operations in Qaddafi's Libya is also
driven by Human Rights Watch (HRW) and its efforts to tie Western governments to
human rights violations committed under Qaddafi. In this regard HRW has
interviewed at least fourteen (14) individuals claiming that they were turned over to
Qaddafi's forces by the Western powers. Belhaj is included in this group.
4. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el Magariafs
enemies are working to take advantage of his suspected links to the CIA at a time when
Western intelligence services are under scrutiny in Libya. They also fear that this
situation will only grow more complex as Qaddafi's son Saif al Islam Qaddafi and al
Senousi are brought before Libyan courts to answer for their crimes under the old
regime, particularly during the 2011 revolution. These individuals believe both men
will be linked to Western Intelligence during their trials. )
5. According to this individual, el Magariaf is working with the Muslim
Brotherhood and other Islamist groups to defuse this situation. He is particularly

concerned by the level of violence between Sufi Muslims and Salafists, and believes he
must maintain his reputation for impartiality if he is to defuse this growing problem.
As he works to organize the government, and disarm the militias, he cannot afford to
lose the respect and trust of the Libyan people, especially at a time when cultural
clashes between followers of the mystical Sufi tradition and ultra-conservative Salafis
have taken central stage in the new Libya. This source adds that these religious
conflicts were largely unknown during Qaddafi's rule.
6. (Source Comment: This source added that the individuals interviewed for the
HRW report were former members of the Libyan Islamist Fighting Group (LIFG), an
Islamist group formed in opposition to Gaddafi's controversial interpretations of Islam.
These LIFO fighters fled the country in the late 198os and went to Afghanistan to join
the fight against the Soviet Union while also gaining training and experience for their
own struggle. A separate source adds that messages to Libya from the CIA and SIS
were found among the Tripoli Documents published by HRW, indicating that the
United States and Britain were eager to help Libya capture several senior LIFG figures,
including its co-founders, Belhaj and Sarni al-Saadi.)
7. As Libyan authorities struggle to control the armed rings that refuse to
surrender weapons following last year's civil war, Salafis, who say Islam should return
to the simple ways followed by Mohammed, have established their own armed gangs in
post-Gaddafi Libya. They view Sufi practices as idolatrous. Since the start of the Arab
Spring uprising across the region, a number of Sufi sites have been attacked in Egypt,
Mali and Libya. Magariaf is determined to establish a democratic state based on
Islamic principles. This individual adds that Magariaf remains dedicated to the idea of
building a tolerant Islamic state in Libya. El Magariafs opinions continue to be shaped
by his experience with Qaddafl, whom he felt built a cult of personality in violation of
all of the basic ideas of Islam.

Statement on the Attack in Benghazi
September 11, 2012
I condemn in the strongest terms the attack on our mission in Benghazi today. As we work to
secure our personnel and facilities, we have confirmed that one of our State Department officers
was killed. We are heartbroken by this terrible loss. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family
and those who have suffered in this attack.
This evening, I called Libyan President Magariaf to coordinate additional support to protect
Americans in Libya. President Magariaf expressed his condemnation and condolences and
pledged his government's full cooperation.
Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted
on the Internet The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs
of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation.
But let me be clear: There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.
In light of the events of today, the United States government is working with partner countries
around the world to protect our personnel, our missions, and American citizens worldwide.
Statement on the Death of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya
September 12, 2012
It is with profound sadness that I share the news of the death of four American personnel in
Benghazi, Libya yesterday. Among them were United States Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens
and Foreign Service Information Management Officer, Sean Smith. We are still making next of
kin notifications for the other two individuals. Our hearts go out to all their families and
colleagues.
A 21 year veteran of the Foreign Service, Ambassador Stevens died last night from injuries he
sustained in the attack on our office in Benghazi.
I had the privilege of swearing in Chris for his post in Libya only a few months ago. He spoke
eloquently about his passion for service, for diplomacy and for the Libyan people. This
assignment was only the latest in his more than two decades of dedication to advancing closer
ties with the people of the Middle East and North Africa which began as a Peace Corps
Volunteer in Morocco. As the conflict in Libya unfolded, Chris was one of the first Americans
on the ground in Benghazi. He risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to
build the foundation for a new, free nation. He spent every day since helping to finish the work
that he started. Chris was committed to advancing America's values and interests, even when
that meant putting himself in danger.
Sean Smith was a husband and a father of two, who joined the Department ten years ago. Like

Chris. Sean was one of our best. Prior to arriving in Benghazi, he served in Baghdad, Pretoria,
Montreal, and most recently The Hague.
All the Americans we lost in yesterday's attacks made the ultimate sacrifice. We condemn this
vicious and violent attack that took their lives, which they had committed to helping the Libyan
people reach for a better future.
America's diplomats and development experts stand on the front lines every day for our country.
We are honored by the service of each and every one of them.
Remarks on the Deaths of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya
September 12, 2012
Yesterday, our U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya was attacked. Heavily armed militants
assaulted the compound and set fire to our buildings. American and Libyan security personnel
battled the attackers together. Four Americans were killed. They included Sean Smith, a Foreign
Service information management officer, and our Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. We are
still making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals.
This is an attack that should shock the conscience of people of all faiths around the world. We
condemn in the strongest terms this senseless act of violence, and we send our prayers to the
families, friends, and colleagues of those we've lost.
All over the world, every day, America's diplomats and development experts risk their lives in
the service of our country and our values, because they believe that the United States must be a
force for peace and progress in the world, that these aspirations are worth striving and sacrificing
for. Alongside our men and women in uniform, they represent the best traditions of a bold and
generous nation.
In the lobby of this building, the State Department, the names of those vvho have fallen in the line
of duty are inscribed in marble. Our hearts break over each one. And now, because of this
tragedy, we have new heroes to honor and more friends to mourn.
Chris Stevens fell in love with the Middle East as a young Peace Corps volunteer teaching
English in Morocco. He joined the Foreign Service, learned languages, won friends for America
in distant places, and made other people's hopes his own.
In the early days of the Libyan revolution, I asked Chris to be our envoy to the rebel opposition.
He arrived on a cargo ship in the port of Benghazi and began building our relationships with
Libya's revolutionaries. He risked his life to stop a tyrant, then gave his life trying to help build a
better Libya. The world needs more Chris Stevenses. I spoke with his sister, Ann, this morning,
and told her that he will be remembered as a hero by many nations.

Sean Smith was an Air Force veteran. He spent 10 years as an information management officer
in the State Department, he was posted at The Hague, and was in Libya on a brief temporary
assignment. He was a husband to his wife Heather, with whom I spoke this morning. He was a
father to two young children, Samantha and Nathan. They will grow up being proud of the
service their father gave to our country, service that took him from Pretoria to Baghdad, and
finally to Benghazi.
The mission that drew Chris and Sean and their colleagues to Libya is both noble and necessary,
and we and the people of Libya honor their memory by carrying it forward. This is not easy.
Today, many Americans are asking -- indeed, I asked myself how could this happen? How
could this happen in a country we helped liberate, in a city we helped save from destruction?
This question reflects just how complicated and, at times, how confounding the world can be.
But we must be clear-eyed, even in our grief. This was an attack by a small and savage group —
not the people or Government of Libya. Everywhere Chris and his team went in Libya, in a
country scarred by war and tyranny, they were hailed as friends and partners. And when the
attack came yesterday, Libyans stood and fought to defend our post. Some were wounded.
Libyans carried Chris' body to the hospital, and they helped rescue and lead other Americans to
safety. And last night, when I spoke with the President of Libya, he strongly condemned the
violence and pledged every effort to protect our people and pursue those responsible.
The friendship between our countries, borne out of shared struggle, will not be another casualty
of this attack. A free and stable Libya is still in America's interest and security, and we will not
turn our back on that, nor will we rest until those responsible for these attacks are found and
brought to justice. We are working closely with the Libyan authorities to move swiftly and
surely. We are also working with partners around the world to safeguard other American
embassies, consulates, and citizens.
There will be more time later to reflect, but today, we have work to do. There is no higher
priority than protecting our men and women wherever they serve. We are working to determine
the precise motivations and methods of those who carried out this assault. Some have sought to
justify this vicious behavior, along with the protest that took place at our Embassy in Cairo
yesterday, as a response to inflammatory material posted on the intemet. America's commitment
to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear — there is
no justification for this, none. Violence like this is no way to honor religion or faith. And as long
as there are those who would take innocent life in the name of God, the world will never know a
true and lasting peace.
It is especially difficult that this happened on September 1 1th It's an anniversary that means a
great deal to all Americans. Every year on that day, we are reminded that our work is not yet
finished, that the job of putting an end to violent extremism and building a safe and stable world
continues. But September 11th means even more than that. it is a day on which we remember

Statement on the Deaths of Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty in Benghazi, Libya
September 13, 2012
The attack on our diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya on Tuesday claimed the lives of four
Americans. Yesterday, I spoke about two: Ambassador Chris Stevens and Information
Management Officer Sean Smith. Today, we also recognize the two security personnel who died
helping protect their colleagues. Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty were both decorated
military veterans who served our country with honor and distinction. Our thoughts, prayers, and
deepest gratitude are with their families and friends. Our embassies could not carry on our
critical work around the world without the service and sacrifice of brave people like Tyrone and
Glen.
Tyrone's friends and colleagues called him "Rone," and they relied on his courage and skill,
honed over two decades as a Navy SEAL. In uniform, he served multiple tours in Iraq and
Afghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in dangerous posts from
Central America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well as the arm of a warrior,
earning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. All our hearts go out to
Tyrone's wife Dorothy and his three sons, Tyrone Jr., Hunter, and Kai, who was born just a few
months ago.
We also grieve for Glen Doherty, called Bub, and his family: his father Bernard, his mother
Barbara, his brother Gregory, and his sister Kathleen. Glen was also a former Navy SEAL and an
experienced paramedic. And he put his life on the line many times, protecting Americans in Iraq,
Afghanistan, and other hotspots. In the end, he died the way he lived — with selfless honor and
unstinting valor.
We condemn the attack that took the lives of these heroes in the strongest terms, and we are
taking additional steps to safeguard American embassies, consulates, and citizens around the
world. This violence should shock the conscience of people of all faiths and traditions. We
appreciate the statements of support that have poured in from across the region and beyond.

People of conscience and goodwill everywhere must stand together in these difficult days against
violence, hate, and division.
I am enormously proud of the men and women who risk their lives every day in the service of
our country and our values. They help make the United States the greatest force for peace,
progress, and human dignity that the world has ever known. We honor the memory of our fallen
colleagues by continuing their work and carrying on the best traditions of a bold and generous
nation.
Remarks at theOpening Plenary of the U.S.-Morocco Strategic Dialogue
September 13, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good morning. Well, let me welcome our friends and colleagues
from Morocco here to the Benjamin Franklin Room on the eighth floor of the State Department
for this very important first session of the U.S.-Morocco Strategic Dialogue. Before I begin to
address the significance of this Strategic Dialogue and the next step in our long relations with
Morocco, I want to say a few words about the events unfolding in the world today.
We are closely watching what is happening in Yemen and elsewhere, and we certainly hope and
expect that there will be steps taken to avoid violence and prevent the escalation of protests into
violence.
I also want to take a moment to address the video circulating on the Internet that has led to these
protests in a number of countries. Let me state very clearly and I hope it is obvious -- that the
United States Government had absolutely nothing to do with this video. We absolutely reject its
content and message. America's commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very
beginning of our nation. And as you know, we are home to people of all religions, many of
whom came to this country seeking the right to exercise their own religion, including, of course,
millions of Muslims. And we have the greatest respect for people of faith.
To us, to me personally, this video is disgusting and reprehensible. It appears to have a deeply
cynical purpose: to denigrate a great religion and to provoke rage. But as I said yesterday, there
is no justification, none at all, for responding to this video with violence. We condemn the
violence that has resulted in the strongest terms, and we greatly appreciate that many Muslims in
the United States and around the world have spoken out on this issue.
Violence, we believe, has no place in religion and is no way to honor religion. Islam, like other
religions, respects the fundamental dignity of human beings, and it is a violation of that
fundamental dignity to wage attacks on innocents. As long as there are those who are willing to
shed blood and take innocent life in the name of religion, the name of God, the world will never
know a true and lasting peace. It is especially wrong for violence to be directed against
diplomatic missions, These are places whose very purpose is peaceful: to promote better
understanding across countries and cultures. All governments have a responsibility to protect

those spaces and people, because to attack an embassy is to attack the idea that we can work
together to build understanding and a better future.
Now, I know it is hard for some people to understand why the United States cannot or does not
just prevent these kinds of reprehensible videos from ever seeing the light of day. Now, I would
note that in today's world with today's technologies, that is impossible. But even if it were
possible, our country does have a long tradition of free expression which is enshrined in our
Constitution and our law, and we do not stop individual citizens from expressing their views no
matter how distasteful they may be.
There are, of course, different views around the world about the outer limits of free speech and
free expression, but there should be no debate about the simple proposition that violence in
response to speech is not acceptable. We all — whether we are leaders in government, leaders in
civil society or religious leaders — must draw the line at violence. And any responsible leader
should be standing up now and drawing that line.
I wanted to begin with this statement, because, as our Moroccan friends and all of you know, this
has been a difficult week at the State Department. I very much appreciate, Minister, the
condolences your government expressed to our Embassy in Rabat. And even though that tragedy
happened far away in Benghazi, we found a reminder of the deep bounds that connect Morocco
to the United States. It was in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco that one of the Americans
we lost this week, Ambassador Chris Stevens, fell in love with the region when he served as a
Peace Corps volunteer there. That experience set him on a decades-long career of service. So in
the memory of fallen friends and colleagues, let us remind ourselves of the many ways in which
not just our governments but the people of our two nations have worked together to build a better
future.
In many ways, the United States looks to Morocco to be a leader and a model. His Majesty King
Mohammed deserves great credit for the work you've undertaken. In fact, after my visit to Rabat
earlier this year, I told my team: "We need to start a Strategic Dialogue with Morocco." No
country has been a friend of the United States longer than Morocco. You were the first nation to
recognize us back in 1777. But we're not satisfied with simply having a friendship that is
longstanding. We want one that is dynamic, growing, looking toward the future. So let me
highlight a few of the areas we should focus on today.
On political reform, we have all seen remarkable changes taking place across North Africa and
the Middle East. I commend Morocco and your government for your efforts to stay ahead of
these changes by holding free and fair elections, empowering the elected parliament, taking other
steps to ensure that the government reflects the will of the people. Today, our political working
group will discuss how the United States can continue to support your efforts to translate
commitments into actions. Because as we all know, democracy, real reform, require that people
themselves feel the changes in their everyday lives: the courts reformed, the goverment more

open and transparent, universal human rights of all Moroccans -- men and women alike —
respected.
I'm especially pleased by Morocco's commitments to take on the deeply troubling problem of
child marriage. We know that child brides are less likely to get an education, more likely to face
life-threatening problems, particularly around child birth and delivery, which not only
shortchanges them but can even rob them and their communities of their lives and talents. So we
want to encourage the government and civil society to continue their important work together on
this issue.
With regard to the Western Sahara, the United States continues to support efforts to find a
peaceful, sustainable, mutually agreed-upon solution. U.S. policy toward the Western Sahara has
remained consistent for many years. We have made clear that Morocco's autonomy plan is
serious, realistic, and credible, and that it represents a potential approach that could satisfy the
aspirations of the people in the Western Sahara to run their own affairs in peace and dignity. We
continue to support the negotiations carried out by the United Nations and hope parties can work
toward resolution.
With respect to the economy, our second working group will focus on what more can be done to
deliver tangible economic benefits. Morocco's economy is relatively healthy, but you face the
same problem that is now endemic across the world — unemployment is still too high, especially
among young people.
That's why the United States is providing $1.5 million to support an effart to attract foreign
investors, foster local economic development, and combat corruption across the region. And I'm
pleased to announce that later this year we will hold a Morocco business development
conference here in Washington to connect businesses from both countries.
'Today, we should discuss ways to build on all of these efforts by increasing bilateral trade, a
particular goal of mine since so much trade from Morocco goes to Europe. I'd like to increase
the amount of trade coming to the United States, and also to improve economic integration
across North Africa, which could greatly benefit Morocco because of Morocco's stability and
Morocco's very strong economic foundation. The greater integration there is, the greater the
benefits for Moroccans.
Third, the attack in Benghazi this week reminds us that security remains a vital issue. Through
our work together on the Global Counterterrorism Task Force, the United States and Morocco
already share crucial information and best practices, and I thank Morocco for hosting a Global
Counterterrorism Task Force workshop on threats in the South Atlantic next month.

We are also collaborating through USAID, the Peace Corps, and other agencies to help provide
Moroccan youth with alternatives to criminal and extremist organizations. And so we are
partnering to help strengthen Morocco's criminal justice system and law enforcement.
There will be a lot to discuss in the meeting today. And let me add, the United States greatly
appreciates the constructive role Morocco is playing on the UN Security Council, especially your
support for the effort to end the violence and bloodshed in Syria and help to usher in a new
democratic future for that country. I commend Morocco for offering to host the next ministerial
meeting of the Friends of the Syrian People, and we look forward to continuing to work closely
together as close partners even after your term on the Security Council has ended.
Finally, our education and cultural ties are reason for much celebration. This year marks the 30th
anniversary of our official program to facilitate academic exchanges and other bonds between us.
There are more than 5,000 Moroccan alumni of these. programs. Two are with us today — Dr.
Benjciloun and Dr. Ouaouicha — and we thank them. But among all our work on this front from
preserving Morocco's historic sites to empowering youth, there's one area I particularly hope we
can focus on today and receive your advice and counsel — munely, interfaith dialogue.
In these tense and turbulent times, its more important than ever for people of different faiths to
exchange ideas, to build understanding, to promote religious tolerance. It's one of the great
challenges of the 21 century, and it's one that we must address together.
So we have a lot of work to do, Minister, but our friendship runs long and deep, and as the treaty
our nations signed in 1786 says. and I quote, "Trusting in God, it will remain permanent." I'm
confident that we will continue to solve problems and produce results that make our nations
stronger more peaceful, more secure, more prosperous, and also contribute to doing the same Rif
the world.
So again, let me welcome you, Minister. Ifs been a great pleasure for me to get to know you, to
work with you, to be your colleague bilaterally, regionally, and globally, and also welcome your
distinguished delegation.
Thank you. (Applause.)
Remarks at Reception Marking Eid
September 13, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good evening, and although I am many weeks overdue in saying it:
Eid Mubarak. No matter how belated we are honoring Eid and the end of Ramadan, this is a
cherished tradition here at the State Department And I would like to thank all of you for being
here, including the many members of the Diplomatic Corps.

Tonight, our gathering is more somber than any of us would like. This comes during sad and
difficult days for the State Department family, We lost four Americans, They were good and
brave men, They were committed to the cause of building a brighter future for the people of
Libya. And we condemn the violence in the strongest terms, the violence against our posts in
Benghazi, in Egypt, and now in Yemen.
The Libyan ambassador is with us tonight, and I want to take a moment to thank him for the
support that his government and the Libyan people have shown to the United States in this
tragedy, particularly the outpouring of feelings of grief and loss because of the killing of our
ambassador.
Ambassador Aujali, would you mind saying a few words?
AMBASSADOR AUJALI: [redacted}
SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Ambassador. I know that that was a very
personal loss for you, as it was for me. I'm the one who sent Chris to Benghazi during the
revolution to show support and be able to advise our government about what we could do to
bring freedom and democracy and opportunity to the people of Libya.
Religious freedom and religious tolerance are essential to the stability of any nation, any people.
Hatred and violence in the name of religion only poison the well. All people of faith and good
will know that the actions of a small and savage group in Benghazi do not honor religion or God
in any way. Nor do they speak for the more than one billion Muslims around the world, many of
whom have shown an outpouring of support during this time.
Unfortunately, however, over the last 24 hours, we have also seen violence spread elsewhere.
Some seek to justify this behavior as a response to inflammatory, despicable material posted on
the internet. As I said earlier today, the United States rejects both the content and the message of
that video. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of
others. At our meeting earlier today, my colleague, the foreign minister of Morocco, said that all
prophets should be respected because they are all symbols of our humanity, for all humanity,
But both of us were crystal clear in this paramount message: There is never any justification for
violent acts of this kind. And we look to leaders around the world to stand up and speak out
against violence, and to take steps to protect diplomatic missions from attack.
Think about it. When Christians are subject to insults to their faith, and that certainly happens,
we expect them not to resort to violence. When Hindus or Buddhists are subjected to insults to
their faiths and that also certainly happens, we expect them not to resort to violence. The same
goes for all faiths, including Islam.

When all of us who are people of faith — and I am one — feel the pain of insults, of
misunderstanding, of denigration to what we cherish, we must expect ourselves and others not to
resort to violence. That is a universal standard and expectation, and it is everyone's obligation to
meet that, so that we make no differences, we expect no less of ourselves than we expect of
others. You cannot respond to offensive speech with violence without begetting more violence.
And I so strongly believe that the great religions of the world are stronger than any insults. They
have withstood offense for centuries. Refraining from violence, then, is not a sign of weakness in
one's faith; it is absolutely the opposite, a sign that one's faith is unshakable.
So tonight, we must come together and recommit ourselves to working toward a future marked
by understanding and acceptance rather than distrust, hatred, and fear. We can pledge that
whenever one person speaks out in ignorance and bigotry, ten voices will answer. They will
answer resoundingly against the offense and the insult, answering ignorance with enlightenment,
answering hatred with understanding, answering darkness with light; that if one person commits
a violent act in the name of religion, millions will stand up and condemn it out of strength.
In times like these, it can be easy to despair that some differences are irreconcilable, some
mountains too steep to climb; we will therefore never reach the level of understanding and
peacefulness that we seek, and which I believe the great religions of the world call us to pursue.
But that's not what I believe, and I don't think it's what you believe either here tonight. Part of
what makes our country so special is we keep trying. We keep working. We keep investing in
our future. We keep supporting the next generation, believing that young people can keep us
moving forward in a positive direction.
So tonight I think it's important that we talk not just about that better tomorrow that we all seek,
but also about some of the things — the real, practical, tangible things — that young people are
doing to help shape that better future.
Two years ago in this room, at our Eid reception, we launched a program called Generation
Change to lead a grassroots agenda of positive engagement with Muslim communities. And I
asked the young Muslim leaders in the audience that night to be our unofficial ambassadors, to
help build personal connections, seek out partners in other countries. And I can report to you
tonight they did not disappoint. In a few minutes, you're going to meet some of these young
leaders, each with a powerful story to tell.
The Generation Change network that started in this room now circles the globe. We are building
an international alliance of young people who want to drive change in their own communities.
They act as mentors, spark respectful debates, simply offer words of encouragement when
needed. But most importantly, they inspire others to keep expanding the circle of mutual
understanding and respect, one person at a time.

Even as we work to spread tolerance more broadly, we also are working to deepen our
appreciation for the experiences of others. Our 2012 Hours Against Hate initiative encourages
young people to put themselves in another person's shoes through service projects. So far, young
people from all over the world have pledged thousands of volunteer hours to help people from a
different background, to see them as a fellow human being, not a stereotype, not a caricature, but
another real live person — people who don't look like you, live like you, pray like you, but with
whom we will share this planet. And therefore, we have work to do.
People of faith and conscience are called to be the leaders of tolerance. In my tradition, like all
traditions, we are expected to love one another. And together, we have to translate that into better
understanding and cooperation. I'm particularly pleased that the young people you will hear from
tonight are really setting an example, not only for young people elsewhere in the world but,
frankly, for us who are older as well.
Let me now call to the stage someone who has been a tremendous assistance to me in these
efforts. Farah Pandith is the Department's first Special Representative to Muslim Communities.
And from the beginning, she has made reaching out to young people and civil society her top
priority. Farah will introduce you to three young leaders who I am very proud of.
Remarks at the Transfer of Remains Ceremony to Honor Those Lost in Attacks in Benghazi, Libya
September 14, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Chaplain. Mr. President, Mr. Vice President,
Secretary Panetta, Ambassador Rice, Secretary Powell and Mrs. Powell, family members of the
four patriots and heroes we bring home, members of the State Department family, ladies and
gentlemen, today we bring home four Americans who gave their lives for our country and our
values. To the families of our fallen colleagues, I offer our most heartfelt condolences and
deepest gratitude.
Sean Smith joined the State Department after six years in the Air Force. He was respected as an
expert on technology by colleagues in Pretoria, Baghdad, Montreal, and The Hague. He enrolled
in correspondence courses at Penn State and had high hopes for the future. Sean leaves behind a
loving wife Heather, two young children, Samantha and Nathan, and scores of grieving family,
friends, and colleagues. And that's just in this world. Because online in the virtual worlds that
Sean helped create, he is also being mourned by countless competitors, collaborators, and garners
who shared his passion.
Tyrone Woods, known to most as Rone, spent two decades as a Navy SEAL, serving multiple
tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in
dangerous posts from Central America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well
as the arms of a warrior, earning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. Our
hearts go out to Tyrone's wife Dorothy, and his three sons Tyrone, Jr., Hunter, and Kai, born just
a few months ago, along with his grieving family, friends, and colleagues.

Glen Doherty, who went by Bub, was also a former SEAL and an experienced paramedic. He too
died as he lived, serving his country and protecting his colleagues. Glen deployed to some of the
most dangerous places on Earth, including Iraq and Afghanistan, always putting his life on the
line to safeguard other Americans. Our thoughts and prayers are with Glen's father Bernard, his
mother Barbara, his brother Gregory, his sister Kathleen, and their grieving families, friends, and
colleagues.
I was honored to know Ambassador Chris Stevens. I want to thank his parents and siblings, who
are here today, for sharing Chris with us and with our country. What a wonderful gift you gave
us. Over his distinguished career in the Foreign Service, Chris won friends for the United States
in far-flung places. He made those people's hopes his own. During the revolution in Libya, he
risked his life to help protect the Libyan people from a tyrant, and he gave his life helping them
build a better cowl
People loved to work with Chris. And as he rose through the ranks, they loved to work for Chris.
He was known not only for his courage but for his smile — goofy but contagious — for his sense
of fun and that California cool.
In the days since the attack, so many Libyans — including the Ambassador from Libya to the
United States, who is with us today — have expressed their sorrow and solidarity. One young
woman, her head covered and her eyes haunted with sadness, held up a handwritten sign that said
"Thugs and killers don't represent Benghazi nor Islam." The President of the Palestinian
Authority, who worked closely with Chris when he served in Jerusalem, sent me a letter
remembering his energy and integrity, and deploring — and I quote — "an act of ugly terror."
Many others from across the Middle East and North Africa have offered similar sentiments.
This has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We've seen the
heavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We've seen rage
and violence directed at American embassies over an awful internet video that we had nothing to
do with. It is hard for the American people to make sense of that because. it is senseless, and it is
totally unacceptable.
The people of Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Tunisia did not trade the tyranny of a dictator for the
tyranny of a mob. Reasonable people and responsible leaders in these countries need to do
everything they can to restore security and hold accountable those behind these violent acts. And
we will, under the President's leadership, keep taking steps to protect our personnel around the
world.
There will be more difficult days ahead, but it is important that we don't lose sight of the
fundamental fact-that America must keep leading the world. We owe it to those four men to
continue the long, hard work of diplomacy. I am enormously proud of the men and women of the
State Department. I'm proud of all those across our government, civilian and military alike, who

So we will wipe away our tears, stiffen our spines, and face the future undaunted. And we will

did. May God bless them and grant their families peace and solace, and may God continue to
bless the United States of America.

earlier this week to grieve with us. He well understands and values the work that these men were
doing for our country. The President of the United States.
Remarks With Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations Patricia Espinosa After Their
Meeting
September 18, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And it is such a pleasure for me to
welcome my friend and colleague, Secretary Espinosa, along with a very distinguished
delegation of officials from the Mexican Government for this continuation of consultation at the
highest levels of each of our governments.
Before I turn to the matters discussed today, let me give a brief update on the ongoing U.S.
response to the protests in the Middle East and elsewhere. I'm sure as you know already, we are
taking aggressive steps to protect our staffs in embassies and consulates worldwide. That
includes reviewing our security posture at every post and augmenting it where necessary. And
we are working closely with the Libyan Government in our efforts to bring to justice those who
murdered our four American colleagues in Benghazi.
The FBI is now in Tripoli to join the investigation with Libyan officials, and there is nothing
more important to us than ensuring the safety of our American representatives worldwide. At the
same time, as I have said to State Department employees, the incidents of the past week highlight
how important our work is. The United States must and will remain strongly engaged in the
world. Our men and women risk their lives in service to our country and our values, because they
know that the United States must be a force for peace and progress. That is worth striving and
sacrificing for, and nothing that happened last week changes this fundamental fact.
Now, turning to our friends and partners in Mexico, we are always pleased to have a chance to
discuss matters of mutual interest and concern between us. Mexico is one of our closest friends
as well as partner on dozens of critical issues. So we talk about every kind of issue you can
imagine, from education and healthcare to poverty alleviation to the environment. But today, we
focused on a top priority for us both — security.

We just co-chaired the fourth meeting of the U.S.-Mexico Merida High-Level Consultative
Group. This is the last one we will hold during the Calderon Administration. And I want to offer
my personal appreciation to President Calderon and to Foreign Secretary Espinosa for their
leadership and commitment to this partnership and to all on both sides of the border in our
governments who have been deeply engaged and committed to it. The Merida Initiative
represents an unprecedented level of security cooperation between Mexico and the United States.
As our countries continue to deal with the serious challenge of transnational' criminal
organizations, including drug traffickers, illegal arms traffickers, money launderers, and violent
gangs that threaten people on both sides of the border, we well know there is no quick and easy
way to stop these criminals and bring them to justice. But nevertheless, during the past now
nearly four years, our countries have collaborated to an extraordinary and unprecedented degree.
We have brought together policy makers and experts from across our governments and societies
who have worked hand in hand to keep our people safe. And I think the habits of cooperation we
have built are among our most important achievements, and we will rely on them for a long time
to come.
Today, our delegations reviewed the gains we've made on key priorities, including improving
law enforcement coordination, reducing the demand for drugs, modernizing our border
infrastructure, strengthening the rule of law, and building more resilient and empowered
communities. We also discussed the lessons we've learned and the work that lies ahead in these
and other areas. which our joint statement will reflect. I want to underscore how important our
security relationship with Mexico is to the United States.
The Government of Mexico and the Mexican people have faced the threat posed by these
criminals with courage and resolve, and we remain committed to doing everything we can to
support Mexico as it continues to work to bring those criminals to justice. This is a transnational
problem, and it calls for a transnational solution, and the United States believes this is a matter of
shared responsibility. That was the first message I brought as Secretary of State when I came to
Mexico, and it continues to be the hallmark of our efforts together. Making sure our people are
safe and our neighbors are safe is of the utmost importance to us.
Now, our two countries share many other priorities, and one of them, empowering women and
girls, was also addressed today. We took the opportunity, the Foreign Secretary and I, to sign a
Memorandum of Understanding between our countries to work together to advance gender
equality, empower girls and women, promote their human rights, and enhance their security.
So again, Secretary Espinosa, let me thank you for years of work and effort, for our productive
conversations in many places around the world and again today, and for being such a valuable
colleague and partner. The United States deeply, deeply values our relationship with Mexico and
the ties of family and friendship that connect so many millions of our people.

And we look forward to the future. We believe strongly that presidential administrations may
change, elections will come and go, but we have established a firm foundation for cooperation
that has already benefited both our countries and which will continue to benefit both of our
countries for many years ahead. So thank you very much.
MS. NULAND: We'll take (inaudible), Margaret Brennan, CBS News.
QUESTION: Madam Secretary, thanks for your time. Are you any closer to finding who killed
Ambassador Chris Stevens?libya's President says this attack was planned for months. Are you
confident he's wrong and that security measures were appropriate? And will you leave justice to
the Libyans?
SECRETARY CLINTON: As I said at the outset, we are taking aggressive steps to protect our
people and our consulates and embassies around the world. We are reviewing our security
posture at every post and working with host govenunents to be sure they know what our security
needs are wherever necessary. We are also working closely with the Libyan Government to bring
the perpetrators to justice so that we can be assured that we have found who murdered our four
colleagues and under what circumstances. As I said, the FBI has joined the investigation inside
Libya, and we will not rest until the people who orchestrated this attack are found and punished.
It is also important to look at this strategically and understand what is going on across the region.
In a number of places where protests have turned violent, we are seeing the hand of extremists
who are trying to exploit people's inflamed passions for their own agendas. But overwhelmingly,
we have found that the people of Egypt, of Libya, of Yemen and Tunisia are not prepared to
trade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob. They want to turn their attention to the
future to provide better opportunities for themselves and their children, and they want a strong
partnership with the United States and the American people based on mutual interests and mutual
respect.
This is part of a larger debate that is going on inside these societies. In Libya, for example, in
their first free elections, moderates were successful at the polls. But look, there are extremists in
all of these societies and on the outside who are working to take advantage of broad outrage in
order to incite violence and specifically incite violence against Americans and American
facilities.
And as I have said to many of the leaders I have spoken to over the past week, these extremist
efforts are a threat to the people of the societies and the governments of those societies as well as
to the region and the United States. And I think it's important at this moment for leaders to put
themselves on the right side of this debate — to speak out clearly and unequivocally against
violence, whoever incites it or conducts it.
And in a struggle like this, there can he no doubt where the United States must stand. We support
those who are fighting for the same values and rights that we believe in — in democracy, in

freedom, in universal rights for men and women, for justice and accountability, And I want to
underscore that the United States will continue to work with partners and allies in the region and
around the world to help bring security to these nations so that the promise of the revolutions that
they experienced can be realized.
And finally, on your specific point about Benghazi, we obviously never talk publicly about
security at any of our missions for obvious reasons. But that said, let me assure you that our
security in Benghazi included a unit of host government security forces, as well as a local guard
force of the kind that we rely on in many places around the world. In addition to the security
outside the compound, we relied on a wall and a robust security presence inside the compound.
And with all of our missions overseas, in advance of September 11th, as is done every year we
did an evaluation on threat streams. And the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has
said we had no actionable intelligence that an attack on our post in Benghazi was planned or
imminent.
But let me state the obvious again. Our diplomats engage in dangerous work, and it's the nature
of diplomacy in fragile societies and conflict zones to be aware of the necessity for security but
to also continue the important diplomatic work that has to go on. There is risk inherent in what
we do and what these brave men and women representing the United States are up against every
single day, and we do our very best to limit that risk by ensuring that our security protocols
reflect the environments in which diplomats work and the threats that they are presented with.
Thank you.
Remarks With Indonesian Foreign Minister Raderi Mohammad Marty Miliaria
Natalegawa After Their Meeting
September 20, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon. everyone. And it's such a pleasure, as always, to
welcome the Indonesian Foreign Minister, and I believe the largest delegation that has ever come
from Indonesia, for the purpose of our third meeting of the U.S.-Indonesia Joint Commission.
This commission is the result of a vision by our two presidents for a comprehensive partnership,
and the agreement to that effect was signed in 2010. Thanks to this partnership, the United States
and Indonesia are working more closely than ever on a range of issues from global security to
clean energy and climate to regional trade and commerce.
And today, Marty and I had the chance to take stock of where our teams have come in the time
of the last year, because we had our meeting in Bali a year ago. And I must say, I was very
impressed. We covered a great deal today,

But before I start, I'd like to say a few words about the protests in several countries around the
world. We have condemned in the strongest possible terms the violence that has erupted from
these protests. And as I have said, the video that sparked these protests is disgusting and
reprehensible, and the United States Government, of course, had absolutely nothing to do with it.
But there is no justification for violence, and I want to thank the Foreign Minister and his
government for speaking out against violence. We have to look to reasonable people and
responsible leaders everywhere to stand up to extremists who would seek to take advantage of
this moment to commit violent acts against embassies and their fellow countrymen.
Today's meetings have highlighted the strong foundation that we have built together. And one of
our most important concerns is promoting peace and stability in the Asia Pacific. Today, I'm
announcing that the Obama Administration has informed Congress of the potential sale of eight
AH-64D Apache Longbow helicopters to the Indonesian Government. This agreement will
strengthen our comprehensive partnership and help enhance security across the region.
On growth and prosperity, we are increasing our trade relationship that topped $26 billion last
year. Investments in transportation, energy, and infrastructure are creating jobs and supporting
economic growth in both countries. For example, the deal between Lion Air and Boeing alone
represents $21 billion in trade over the next decade. Indonesia's Government has announced half
a trillion dollars in infrastructure improvements, and we recently signed a memorandum of
understanding to make it easier for American companies to bid on these projects.
And yesterday, we signed an agreement for implementing our Millennium Challenge
Corporation Compact with Indonesia. Over the next five years, the United States will invest $600
million in clean energy development, child health and nutrition programs, and efforts to help
make Indonesia's Government more transparent and open.
The United States is also looking forward to Indonesia hosting APEC in 2013, and we are
confident that Indonesia will come to this role with a commitment to promote greater economic
integration across the Asia Pacific.
Both the Foreign Minister and I believe that strong education is essential to compete in a modem
global economy. That's why the United States has expanded the Fulbright Program and
supported partnerships between dozens of American and Indonesian universities. Academic
exchanges between our countries are up and applications from Indonesian students to visit the
United States have increased by one third. USAID has recently expanded its basic education
program to provide $83 million for teacher training and literacy programs for young children.
And we're providing $20 in scholarship funding for Indonesian graduate students.

I also thanked the Minister for Indonesia's leadership in ASEAN. The Foreign Minister's
personal leadership has helped lay the groundwork for diplomacy between ASEAN and China as
it relates to the South China Sea. And we continue to support ASEAN's six-point principles,
which we believe will help reduce tensions and pave the way for a comprehensive code of
conduct for addressing disputes without threats, coercion, or use of force.
Finally, Indonesia and the United States have stood together on a range of global challenges,
from democratic reform in Burma to combating climate change, to working to end the violence
in Syria. We are also coordinating efforts to further develop south-south and triangular
cooperation, such as enhancing disaster preparedness in Burma and convening a conference on
women's empowerment.
We believe that as the second and third-largest democracies in the world, the United States and
Indonesia have a special responsibility to promote democracy and human rights. And for the last
four years, Indonesia has hosted the Bali Democracy Forum to promote peaceful, democratic
transitions through example and open dialogue. Last year, more than 80 countries attended. And
once again, the United States will be sending a high-level delegation.
So, Minister, thank you for everything. Thank you for the great partnership we've had between
us and between our countries.
MS. NULAND: We'll take two questions today,we'll start with Ros Jordan of Al Jazeera
English.
QUESTION: Thank you, Madam Secretary, Mr. Foreign Minister. Madam Secretary, my
question is about the ongoing investigation into last week's attack at the consulate in Benghazi.
You are meeting this afternoon with members of Congress to discuss the progress and the
concerns that they understandably have. First, there is the federal mandate to establish an
accountability review board. Have you done so? Who would you like to see chair it? Are there
certain questions that you desperately want to have answered in order to safeguard the safety of
Foreign Service Officers around the world?
And related to this, given the political instability and the successes of the past year and a half, are
you satisfied that in light of those political changes, enough was done to protect those working in
the Middle East and North Africa? And then finally — and this is perhaps going into the area of
rumor and speculation — but there is at least one report suggesting that Ambassador Stevens felt
that he was on a, quote, "al-Qaida hit list." Is this a scurrilous rumor? Is this gallows humor
when one is working in a period of difficulty and great challenge, or is there something more to
what he allegedly — and I stress that word — said?

SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, first, let me say I'm looking forward to the opportunity to go
up to the Congress today. I will be briefing in two separate sessions, the House and the Senate, in
a classified setting, along with my interagency colleagues, as we continue to work together, and
with governments around the world, to ensure that our people and our facilities are safe. I will be
joined today by the Director of National Intelligence, General Clapper, by the Deputy Secretary
of Defense, Ash Carter, by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Sandy Witmefeld,
along with experts from the FBI, the State Department, and elsewhere in the government.
Now, I anticipate that this briefing will cover our security posture before and during the events,
and the steps we have taken since to do everything we can with host governments to protect our
people and our embassies and consulates. The Director of National Intelligence will speak to the
intelligence issues surrounding these events in Libya. Deputy Secretary Carter will brief on the
superb support we have had from the U.S. military in the wake of these events, and we are at the
very early stages of an FBI investigation. The team from the FBI reached Libya earlier this week.
And I will advise Congress also that I am launching an accountability review board that will be
chaired by Ambassador Thomas Pickering.
I will also talk about the importance of the broader relationships with these countries in light of
the events of the past days. There are obviously very real challenges in these new democracies,
these fragile societies, but as I said last week, the vast majority of the people in these countries
did not throw off the tyranny of a dictator to trade it for the tyranny of a mob. And we are
concerned first and foremost with our own people and facilities, but we are concerned about the
internal security in these countries because ultimately, that puts at risk the men, women, and
children of these societies on a daily ongoing basis if actions are not taken to try to restore
security and civil order.
And let me just conclude by saying that there can be no doubt where the United States stands.
We continue to support those who are fighting for universal values — values that we see at work
in Indonesia — the third largest democracy in the world. We believe that these values of universal
rights, of justice and accountability, of democracy, are there for every person regardless of where
that person might live. So I will look forward to having a chance to talk with members of
Congress.
As to your final question, I have absolutely no information or reason to believe that there's any
basis for that.
QUESTION: Thank you.
MS. NULAND: Last question. Victoria Sidjabat from Tempo Magazine, please.
QUESTION: Yes. Madam, thank you. My question is: Starting today, U.S. Embassy and
Consulate are closed in Indonesia as the Muslim movie become wild fireball, which could be

designed as a weapon to attack U.S. by raising sentiment anti-U.S. from the countries which has
Muslim majority population like Indonesia.
Madam Clinton, how do you see this threat as on the long run? If it's continuing happen, it's
obviously could give impact to the implementation of (inaudible) program in Indonesia. What is
the reason U.S. Government closed the Embassy and Consulate in Indonesia? What is your
expectation from Indonesia Government, for my Minister Marty Natalegawa? How Indonesia
Government respond to the closing of this Embassy and Consulate, it's starting today? Is U.S. -
Indonesia Government has Capability to protect U.S. Embassy and Consulate. So the (inaudible)
program implemented - could be implemented successfidly in Indonesia. Thank you
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, let me begin by saying how grateful we are for the excellent
cooperation we have received from the Government of Indonesia, and in particular, from the law
enforcement and security institutions in Indonesia. We are very grateful for not only the
cooperation and protection that has been provided to our facilities, but also to the strong
statements condemning violence from the President, the Foreign Minister, and others.
In consultation with the Government of Indonesia, we have temporarily, for tomorrow, closed
our facilities. We want to be sure that law enforcement in Indonesia has the ability to do what it
needs to do to make sure that there is no disruption of civil order and security. So we are
cooperating completely, and we're very grateful for the strong leadership provided by Indonesia.
FOREIGN MINIStER NATALEGAWA: Hello, (inaudible), if I may just also respond.
Precisely as the Secretary had said, the decision by the United States Government to close
temporarily its embassies and consulates tomorrow in Indonesia is a decision that's been made
based on communication and conversation between the authorities in Indonesia and the United
States as well. So in other words, it is an informed decision, a decision that is not intended to
show any unfriendly intent on the part of anyone, but it is what it is, and it's quite some - it's the
kind of step that governments actually carry out when situations requires it, even in our case.
Some of our embassies abroad, when the situation requires us to have a temporary closing of the
embassy, we do that as well. So it is something that is quite regular and something that is
actually coordinated as well.
But if I may just broaden the subject matter, I think as our President had said in the past,
Indonesian Government - the Indonesian people, even, obviously cannot and would not condone
the - any acts of violence against diplomatic premises, against diplomatic personnel, because
that is, truly - would be a challenge to the efficient and a proper conduct of relations among
states. So that's our point of departure.
At the same time, of course, beyond the immediate issue of protection of the embassies, we have
still ahead of us the challenge of how to prevent the kind of situations where we are now at in

terms of the kind of incendiary and the kind of statements or, in this instance, films that cause —
that is now we have all deplored and condemned for these kind of activities not to be repeated.
So we have a lot of homework to work towards in the future as well.

Remarks With Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar Before Their Meeting
September 21, 2012
Good afternoon, and let me begin by welcoming Foreign Minister Khar on her first visit to
Washington as foreign minister. We've had the opportunity to meet in Islamabad and other
settings, but I am very pleased that we would have this chance to exchange views on our bilateral
relationship as well as regional and global issues.
I want to begin by addressing the events of the day and the past week. Today, we've once again
seen protests in several cities in Pakistan. Unfortunately, some of those protests have turned
violent and, sadly, resulted in loss of life. I want to thank the Government of Pakistan for their
efforts to protect our Embassy in Islamabad and consulates in Lahore, Peshawar, and Karachi.
And I want to be clear, as I have said on numerous occasions, the violence we have seen cannot
be tolerated. There is no justification for violence. Of course, there is provocation, and we have
certainly made clear that we do not in any way support provocation We found the video that's at
the core of this series of events offensive, disgusting, reprehensible.
But that does not provide justification for violence, and therefore it is important for responsible
leaders, indeed responsible people everywhere, to stand up and speak out against violence and
particularly against those who would exploit this difficult moment to advance their own
extremist ideologies.
Yesterday afternoon when I briefed the Congress, I made it clear that keeping our people
everywhere in the world safe is our top priority. What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist
attack, and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who
murdered four Americans. And we are taking aggressive measures at all of our posts to protect
our staffs and their families along with locally employed people who provide so many important
contributions to the work of our missions.
The Foreign Minister and I will have a chance to cover a full range of subjects today, and it is no
secret that the past year and a half has been challenging for Pakistan and the United States. And
we still have work to do to get our bilateral relationship to the point where we would like it to be,
but ‘ve 1

today is the latest in a series of high-level meetings. Ambassador Marc Grossman has just
returned from consultations in Islamabad. I look forward to seeing President Zardari next week
at the UN General Assembly. At each meeting, we are working to identify the strategic goals we
share — and there are many — and the concrete actions we can each take to accomplish them.
Our number one shared priority remains pursuing our joint counterterrorism objectives to ensure
the security of American and Pakistani citizens alike. We face a common threat from a common
enemy, and we must confront terrorism and extremism together. Earlier this Month, I designated
the Haggani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization so we could make full use of every
available legal authority to end their deadly attacks. Pakistan's parliament has called for
expelling foreign fighters so that Pakistan's territory can be fully under control of the Pakistani
Government and cannot be used to launch attacks against other nations.
And the follow-through on this is challenging but necessary, and we look forward to working
with Pakistan as they continue to address these problems. We have both pledged to support a
secure, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan, which is vital for the security of the region. And I
want to thank Foreign Minister Khar for Pakistan's reopening of the NATO supply lines to allow
the movement of goods to Afghanistan.
We will discuss the successful first meeting of the Safe Passage Working Group in Islamabad
which brought together Afghan, Pakistani, and U.S. representatives to advance the peace process
in Afghanistan. The Pakistani Government's public call for insurgents to come forward and talk
with the Afghan Government was particularly important. We are ready to work together to build
on these steps, and we will continue OUT discussions through bilateral consultations and the U.S.-
Afghanistan-Pakistan Core Group.
Now, of course, our relationship goes far beyond our shared security concerns, and today we will
discuss the many other ways in which we work together, particularly to create economic
opportunity for Pakistanis. Foreign Minister Khar and I agree that we need to shift our economic
relationship front aid to trade and investment. We are working to help Pakistan attract more
private sector investment We hope to finalize a bilateral investment treaty soon. And we've
created a Pakistan private investment initiative to help more of Pakistan's small and medium
sized companies get access to capital.
Over the past few years, we have seen Pakistan's civilian government begin to put down stronger
roots. And if elections proceed as planned next year, it will mark the first time in Pakistan's
history that a civilian-led government has served its full term. The United States supports
Pakistan's economic development, and we have said many times that we want to see democracy
succeed in Pakistan.

We also support Pakistan's sovereignty, but we are clear that all sovereign nations carry certain
obligations to protect the human rights of their citizens, to control their territory, to prevent
threats to their neighbors and the international community.
So we know that there is still much to be done, but I can assure the people of Pakistan that the
United States remains committed to this important relationship and we are confident we can
continue to move forward together one step at a time to reach our shared strategic objectives.
Thank you very much.
Remarks With Tunisian Foreign Minister Rafik Ahdessalem Before Their Meeting
September 21, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good morning. I am pleased to welcome the Foreign Minister from
Tunisia. I'm looking forward to our meeting. We obviously have a great deal to discuss, and I
want to thank the Foreign Minister and the Government of Tunisia for their efforts over the last
week to help secure our Embassy and the American Cooperative School of Tunis following the
violent assaults of last Friday.
We are monitoring events closely today. There is no higher priority for President ()barna and
myself than the safety of our people. We've taken a number of steps around the world to
augment security and to protect our personnel at diplomatic posts. And we are working closely
with host governments in this effort.
As I have said before and as is embodied in the Vienna Convention and other international
agreements, all governments have the duty, the solemn duty, to defend diplomatic missions.
They must be safe and protected places so that governments can exchange views and work on
many important issues, and leaders across the world must stand up and be counted in rejecting
violence and holding violent actors accountable.
We are working closely with the Government of Tunisia. They have assisted us in enhancing the
security of our facilities. We've also discussed with them the imperative of bringing to justice
those responsible for these violent attacks. And we have offered and will continue to look for
ways that we can assist the new Government of Tunisia in ensuring the rule of law throughout
their country, first and foremost for the people of Tunisia themselves. We look forward to
continuing to build our new partnership with the Tunisian Government and people. Our
relationship is built around the shared principles of all democracies — a commitment to
nonviolence, to tolerance, and inelusivity for all people, and to upholding the rule of law.
The Tunisian people have bravely put themselves on the road to democracy. They were the first
of the Arab revolutions and they have made important progress in a very short period of time.
They have worked too hard and sacrificed too much over too many years to see their progress
hijacked or derailed by extremists with their own agenda. And those extremists, not only in

Tunisia but in too many places around the world, look for opportunities to exploit this current
situation or other situations, and all people and leaders must stand against them.
So as the Tunisian Government takes steps to strengthen security and protect the Tunisian people
and economy from extremism and violent agendas, the United States stands ready to help. We
also are working closely with Tunisia on the broader shared threat of terrorism, including from
groups like al-Qaida and its affiliates.
So Minister, please know the United States remains committed to supporting Tunisia as you deal
with this current situation, as you continue your democratic transition, and we want to be with
you as you confront challenges and help seize opportunities together for the betterment of the
future of Tunisia.

GOP's October surprise?
They're calling it the "Jimmy Carter Strategy": Exploit
Libya attack to paint Obama as weak on terrorism
By Craig Unger_
(Credit: AP/A1 Behrman/Salon)
According to a highly reliable source, as Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama prepare for the
first presidential debate Wednesday night, top Republican operatives are primed to unleash a new
two-pronged offensive that will attack Obama as weak on national security, and will be based, in part,
on new intelligence information regarding the attacks in Libya that killed U.S. ambassador Chris
Stevens on September
The source, who has first-hand knowledge of private, high-level conversations in the Romney camp
that took place in Washington, DC last week, said that at various times the GOP strategists referred to
their new operation as the Jimmy Carter Strategy or the October Surprise.
He added that they planned to release what they hoped would be "a bombshell" that would make
Libya and Obama's foreign policy a major issue in the campaign. "My understanding is that they have
come up with evidence that the Obama administration had positive intelligence that there was going
to be a terrorist attack on the intelligence."
The source described the Republicans as chortling with glee that the Obama administration
"definitely had intel" about the attack before it happened. "Intelligence can be graded in different
ways," he added, "and sometimes A and B don't get connected. But [the Romney campaign] will try to
paint it to look like Obama had advance knowledge of the attack and is weak on terrorism."
He said they were jubilant about their new strategy and said they intended to portray Obama as a
helpless, Jimmy Carter-like president and to equate the tragedy in Libya with President Carter's failed

attempt to rescue American hostages in Iran in 1980. "They are so excited about it," he said. "Over
and over again they talked about how it would be just like Jimmy Carter's failed raid. They feel it is
going to give them a last-minute landslide in the election."
The source, however, said he was dubious about the tactic. "To me, it is indicative that they have lost
touch with a huge portion of the electorate," he said.
The source declined to reveal the names of the GOP operatives who were present. But he said, "These
were the top guys in the party, It was a private, unguarded planning conversation." He further
described participants in the meeting as consisting of well-known names tied to the big Republican
super PACs and people who had access to high-level national security intelligence.
"As usual, Karl Rove wasn't present," he said, "but some were close to Rove."
The source said that "there was quite a bit more" to the operation than simply revealing the
intelligence regarding Libya. He declined to discuss what he described as the second phase of the
operation.
However, already there is evidence that the first phase of the operation is underway. On Wednesday,
September 26, on Fox News, Karl Rove called Obarna's reaction to what happened in Libya
"inexplicable" and added that Obama is "more intent on campaigning than meeting his
responsibilities as commander-in-chief." He went on to warn that Obama's policies in Libya
endangered the U.S. with regard to Iran. "I am astonished," Rove said. "We are projecting weakness
when we need to be projecting strength."
Similarly, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a one-time GOP presidential hopeful who
became known as the mayor of 9/11, followed Rove in criticizing Obama on the attack in Libya. "This
is a deliberate attempt to cover up the truth, from an administration that claimed it wanted to be the
most transparent in history," he told Fox News. "And it's the worst kind of cover-up: the kind of
cover-up that involves our national security. This is a cover-up that involves the slaughter of four
Americans."
Giuliani added that the Obama White House wanted to dismiss the role played by al-Qaeda because it
seemed to diminish the triumph of having killed Osama bin Laden. "I think it's because they have this
narrative that they defeated al-Qaeda," he said. "They never say the words 'Islamic fundamentalist
terrorism'. They want to wish it away. The president was moving on to Asia — he was going to declare
this a great victory for himself and unfortunately, this terrible act of terror intervened in their very
convenient narrative."
Likewise, Bob Corker, Republican senator from Tennessee, described the administration's response to
"the terrorist attack" in Libya as laiaarre." And on Sunday, September 30, both Mitt Romney and
vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan joined in the attacks. "I think they want to do their very best to
keep the people of America from understanding exactly what happened. We expect candor, we expect
transparency, particularly as it relates to terrorism," Romney said.
Added Ryan, "Why is he (Obama) not on the same page with his own administration officials who are
saying that this is a terrorist attack? We'll leave it up to you to decide whether it's a cover-up or not."
In an apparently related development, a Politico article posted last night said Romney advisers were
divided over how aggressively to attack President Obama over his handling of the events in Libya. One
unnamed Romney adviser described them as "a huge gift" to the campaign. "Across the board —
domestic, economic and foreign-policy issues — President Obama has been outmatched by events," he
said. "He's an observer of events, not a shaper of events. Everywhere you look, he's been outmatched."
But other Romney advisers, led by media strategist Stuart Stevens, wanted to stick to the economy as
the central issue. "They'll tell you that you've got to focus people on the fact that their economic
prospects are not very good and all that," the aide told Politico. "Well, ROITIlley'S been trying to do that
now since he clinched the nomination at the end of April — and he's failed. The president is better at
deflecting attention from the bad news than Romney is at driving home the impact of the bad news on
individual voters."

Romney has an op-ed in today's Wall Street Journal playing off Stevens' murder to say Obama has put
"security at risk," etc.
According to Politico yesterday, there was an internal argument within the Romney campaign over
Libya. Obviously, the neocons and the Rove oriented faction (Ed Gillespie, Rove's surrogate is now a
Romney campaign adviser) beat Stuart Stevens.
Romney is careening from tactic to tactic, hoping something will catch.
I wouldn't be surprised to see Romney raise the specter of the Muslim Brotherhood in charge of Egypt
& Libya as a bogeyman. I have heard him do this within the last week.

Stephens: Benghazi Was Obama's 3 a.m. Call
Libya was a failure of policy and worldview, not intelligence.
Why won't the Libya story go away? Why can't the memory of U.S. Ambassador Chris
Stevens and his staff be consigned to the same sad-and-sealed file of Americans killed abroad
in dangerous line of duty? How has an episode that seemed at first to have been mishandled by
the Romney camp become an emblem of a feckless and deluded foreign policy?
The story-switching and stonewalling haven't helped. But let's start a little earlier.
The hour is 5 p.m., Sept. 11, Washington time, and the scene is an Oval Office meeting among
President °barna, the secretary of defense, the national security adviser and the chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi has been under assault for
roughly 90 minutes. Some 30 U.S. citizens are at mortal risk. The whereabouts of Ambassador
Stevens are unknown.
What is uppermost on the minds of the president and his advisers? The safety of Americans,
no doubt. So what are they prepared to do about it? Here is The Wall Street Journal's account
of the meeting:
"There was no serious consideration at that hour of intervention with military force, officials
said. Doing so without Libya's permission could represent a violation of sovereignty and

inflame the situation, they said. Instead, the State Department reached out to the Libyan
government to get reinforcements to the scene."
So it did. Yet the attack was far from over. After leaving the principal U.S. compound, the
Americans retreated to a second, supposedly secret facility, which soon came under deadly
mortar fire. Time to call in the troops?
"Some officials said the U.S. could also have sent aircraft to the scene as a 'show of force' to
scare off the attackers," the Journal reported, noting that there's a U.S. air base just 450 miles
away in Sicily. "State Department officials dismissed the suggestions as unrealistic. 'They
would not have gotten there in two hours, four hours or six hours."
The U.S. security detail only left Washington at 8 a.m. on Sept. 12, more than 10 hours after
the attacks began. A commercial jet liner can fly from D.C. to Benghazi in about the same
time.
All this is noted with the benefit of hindsight, and the administration deserves to be judged
accordingly. But it also deserves to be judged in light of what it knew prior to the attack,
including an attack on the mission in June and heightened threat warnings throughout the
summer.
So how did the administration do on that count? "That the local security did so well back in
June probably gave us a false sense of security," an unnamed American official who has
served in Libya told the New York Times last week.
The logic here is akin to supposing that because the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center
failed to bring down the towers, nobody need have been concerned thereafter. But let's still
make allowances for the kind of bureaucratic ineptitude that knows neither administration nor
political party.
The more serious question is why the administration alighted on the idea that the attack wasn't
a terrorist act at all. Also, what did the White House think it had to gain by adopting the
jihadist narrative that a supposedly inflammatory video clip was at the root of the trouble?
Nobody can say. All the administration will acknowledge is that it has "revised [its] initial
assessment to reflect new information that it was a deliberate and organized terrorist attack."
That's from James Clapper, the director of national intelligence. It suggests that our
intelligence agencies are either much dumber than previously supposed (always a strong
possibility) or much more politicized (equally plausible).
No doubt the administration would now like to shift blame to Mr. Clapper. But what happened
in Benghazi was not a failure of intelligence. It was a failure of policy, stemming from a
flawed worldview and the political needs of an election season.
Let's review:
The U.S. ignores warnings of a parlous security situation in Benghazi. Nothing happens
because nobody is really paying attention, especially in an election year, and because Libya is
supposed to be a foreign-policy success. When something does happen, the administration's
concerns for the safety of Americans are subordinated to considerations of Libyan
"sovereignty" and the need for "permission." After the attack the administration blames a
video, perhaps because it would be politically inconvenient to note that al Qaeda is far from

America first. Once that story falls apart, it's time to blame the intel munchkins and move on.

How Our Words Unite, Divide, and Define a Nation," is a regular CAW Belief Blog contributor.
By Stephen Prothero, Special to CNN
What should we make of the attacks on the U.S. consulates in Egypt, Libya and Yemen, and the deaths of
four Americans, including U.S. ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens?
It depends on who you mean by "we."
From the perspective of those who stormed the embassies, taking down the American flag in Egypt and
replacing it with a black flag reading, -'rhere is no God but Allah and Mohammed is his messenger," theirs was
an act of justice on behalf of the One True Faith.
The Americans had it coming, according to this view, because Americans are on the wrong side in the clash of
civilizations between the Judeo-Christian West and the Muslim world. And the creation of an anti-Islamic video
(ironically entitled "Innocence of Muslims") by a producer thought to be an American provided the catalyst
(or excuse) for the protests.
Why Muslims are sensitive about portraying the Prophet Mohammed
Most Americans operate by a different "we.." From our perspective, the assault was an unjust and cowardly
attack on (among other things) the rule of law, the institution of diplomacy and the right of free speech.
Libyan Deputy Prime Minister Mustafa Abushagur gave voice to this perspective when he said on Twitter, "I
condemn these barbaric attacks in the strongest possible terms. This is an attack on America, Libya and free
people everywhere."
"Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the
Internet," Secretary of State Hillary Clinton added. "The United States deplores any intentional effort to
denigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning
of our nation."

In a commencement speech at Kenyon College in 2005, later published as "This Is Water," novelist David
Foster Wallace urged student to scrutinize the "natural, basic self-centeredness" that puts "me" at the center of
the world.
This unconscious "default setting" fosters the sort of "blind certainty" that manifests as arrogant atheism and
fundamentalism alike, Wallace said. And the point of education is to shake us out of that "default setting" — to
begin to see things from the perspectives of others.

Wallace focused in his speech on the individual "I." But his critique can be applied as well to another "default
setting" (this one more cultural than natural): our tendency to understand the world from the perspective of
"we.11
According to those who stormed the embassies, "Innocence of Muslims" was not made by an individual
(whoever the shadowy "Sam Bacile" may — or may not — be). It was made by anAmerican.
Moreover, according to this groupthink, Americans as a group are responsible for the sins of individual
Americans, so it makes perfect sense to strike out at embassy personnel who issued a statement before the
protests turned deadly, condemning "the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious
feelings of Muslims, as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions."
CNN's Belief Blog: The faith angles behind the biggest stories
Meanwhile, the shadowy figures who produced and distributed "Innocence of Muslims" are imprisoned in some
groupthink of their own, which gathers all the world's Muslims under the category of an evil Islamic empire.
Their film doesn't just depict Mohammed as a con man, philanderer, and pedophile. It portrays his followers as
dupes.
Unfortunately, the events of recent days have done nothing to jar the alleged producer out of this default setting.
When questioned about his film in the aftermath of the Libyan and Egyptian attacks, a man identifying himself
as "Sam Bacile" reportedly told the Wall Street Journal that "Islam is a cancer."
You don't need a Kenyon college degree to see how this vicious cycle of provocation and violence is fueled,
and you don't need to be a moral relativist to see that it takes two sides to keep it running.
I am an American who is justly proud of the First Amendment and its protections of freedom of speech and
religion. And I believe that killing your opponents in the name of God or nation is a far greater offense than
offending them with an ignorant movie.
Nonetheless, the root problem on display here is in my view what Wallace denounced as "blind certainty."
Our world is not divided first and foremost along religious or national lines, into Muslims and Christians and
Hindus or Israelis and Americans and Egyptians.
Neither is it divided into secularists and people of faith — the New Atheists and partisans of old-time religion.
The real "red line" in the modern world divides the certain from the uncertain. And in the tragic events of recent
days, those who produced and distributed this hateful movie stand on the same side of this line as the killers of
innocents in Libya and Egypt.
Both groups are possessed by the unholy spirit of "blind certainty," unacquainted with both the complexity and
contradictions of life on Earth and the "cloud of unknowing" that hovers over every major religion.

The great religious thinkers in Judaism, Christianity and Islam always knew enough to know that they did not
know everything.
They knew the difference between the eternal decrees of the God of Abraham and the all-too-flawed thoughts of
ordinary people. They knew, in short, that they are not God, who alone is charged with creating and destroying
the world and discriminating along the way between the real and the illusory.
The killers in Libya have forgotten that. So have the not-so-innocent producers and distributors of "Innocence
of Islam."

Re: Libya cabinet polities
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1.As of October 5, 2012 Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf, the new interim President of Libya
told senior advisors that the abortive efforts to form a cabinet under new Prime Minister Mustafa
Abushagur represent the first step in the next phase of the struggle for control of the new Libyan
Government. According to a sensitive source Magariaf is concerned that Abushagur, supported by the
Muslim Brotherhood's (MB) Justice and Construction Party (JCP), as well as certain of the other
more traditional Islamist groups, is looking to establish day to day administrative control the new
government while defining Magariaf as a ceremonial Head of State.
2. According to this individual, the President, who is not affiliated with a particular party
holding seats in the General National Council (GNC), spoke with the new Prime Minister immediately
after Abushagur was elected by the GNC on September 12. At that time Magariaf advised him to

include in his government members of former Prime Minister Mahmoud 'fibril's National Forces
Alliance (NFA), Abushagar having only narrowly defeated (fibril in the GNC vote. At that time
Magariaf was not aware of the fact that 'fibril had already demanded 9 cabinet seats for the NFA;
however, he did point out that even Jibril's more moderate followers were committed to the idea of a
modern Islamic state and would fit into the new cabinet. The President came away from this
discussion with the impression that Abushagur and his supporters intend to marginalize Jibril and
the 39 Members of Parliament (MP) controlled by the NFA, concentrating instead on working with
the 120 independent MPs in the GNC, looking to establish a more conservative administration. This
individual added that Abushagur made it clear that while the President was free to choose his Vice
President and staff, the Prime Minister would choose the national cabinet, supported by the GNC.
3. (Source Comment: According to this individual, Magariaf is allowing the current crisis in
the Abushagur administration to play out without direct interference. He is convinced that the desire
of the Libyan people for peace and stability, which brought him to power, added to the need to
balance the regional and political rivalries throughout the country, will lead to the formation of a
cabinet that is acceptable to all parties. Magariaf also believes that these developments will eventually
leave him as the dominant figure in the government.)
4. In addition, this individual added that Magariaf is seized with the national security
situation, the ongoing effort to disarm militia units, and the investigation of the murder of the United
States Ambassador. All of these efforts are related to what he sees as his most important role,
rebuilding the confidence of the international business community in its ability to operate in Libya
safely and efficiently. To this end he does agree with Abushagur that it is important to replace the
cabinet of former Prime Minister Abdel Rahman el-Keib, particularly Minister of Oil Abdulrahman
Ben Yazza, whose connections to the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi, and the Italian
Oil firm ENI made him unacceptable to the JCP and other conservative parties. That said, this
individual notes that Magariaf was surprised and not pleased with the appointment to the ministry of
Mabrouk Issa Abu Harrow-a, another technical expert, who previously worked for Libya's Zueitina Oil
Company as well as in the oil sector abroad. Magariaf feels that Abu Harroura does not have the
standing among the foreign oil companies that Ben Yezza enjoyed, although he was more acceptable
to a number of the conservative members of the GNC.
5. Magariaf was pleased that the Prime Minister, after dramatic confrontations with MPs and
demonstrators who entered the GNC chamber, withdrew his cabinet nominations. The President
again advised Abushagur to name former Oil and Finance Minister All Tarhouni to the Oil Ministry
post; however, he fears that that Ali Tarhouni is seen as too close to Western governments to gain

acceptance in the GNC. Magariaf is concerned that, while the new cabinet Abushagur plans to put
forward on October 7 may contain some members of the NFA and other moderate groups, it will still
be dominated by the JCP and conservative elements, and will again fail to gain acceptance, leading to
a real government crisis.
6. According to this individual Magariaf and his advisors knew in advance that more than 100
protesters planned to enter the GNC session on October 4, in an effort to prevent MPs from convening
to vote on the new cabinet. While Magariaf did not directly influence these protesters he did nothing
to warn or advise Abushagur on the developing situation. In particular, the protestors objected to the
failure of the Prime Minister to name any minister from the Zawiya region. Although the
demonstrators eventually left the hall, a number of the independent MPs, who had said they would
support the new cabinet, were shaken by the incident and changed their positions. In the end,
according to this individual, Abushagur's efforts to rally their support failed, and he was forced to
withdraw all of the nominees, promising to submit a new list on October 7, one that would take into
account regional and political considerations.
7. In the opinion of a particularly sensitive source, the failure of Abushagur to name any NFA
ministers to the new cabinet will continue to complicate the matter. For his part Magariaf is
concerned over international perceptions regarding the nature of the new Libyan government. In this
regard, he fears that the Western press is too sharply focused on the fact that the NFA holds the
largest single bloc of votes in the GNC (38), missing the fact that the real power in the parliament lies
with the 120 independent deputies, who tend to be somewhat conservative on religious and social
matters, while focusing primarily on local political issues. Magariaf believes that the appointment of
All Tarhouni, or another liberal not associated with the NFA, would serve to reassure Western
business and government leaders while demonstrating political balance to the Libyan people.
Although he continues to make this point, the President has no indication that Abushagur will follow
his advice. He does expect Abushagur to again select a majority of cabinet ministers associated with
the MB and the JCP.
8. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Magariaf will remain focused on the security
situation, particularly as he is having some success disarming the militias following the death of the U.S.
Ambassador. According to this individual, Magariaf believes he must end the power of the regional militia
forces before the Libyan economy can improve. The President knows that foreign companies are the key to
Libyan oil production, but he fears that they will not increase their commitment to Libya until the government
can insure the security of their personnel and facilities. In a final note, this individual added that the Italian

intend to marginalize Jibril and the 39 Members of Parliament (MP) controlled by the NFA,
concentrating instead on working with the 120 independent MPs in the GNC, looking to
establish a more conservative administration. This individual added that Abushagur made it
clear that while the President was free to choose his Vice President and staff, the Prime Minister
would choose the national cabinet, supported by the GNC.
3. (Source Comment: According to this individual, Magariaf is allowing the current
crisis in the Abushagur administration to play out without direct interference. He is convinced
that the desire of the Libyan people for peace arid stability, which brought him to power, added
to the need to balance the regional and political rivalries throughout the country, will lead to the
formation of a cabinet that is acceptable to all parties. Magariaf also believes that these
developments will eventually leave him as the dominant figure in the government.)
4. In addition, this individual added that Magariaf is seized with the national security
situation, the ongoing effort to disarm militia units, and the investigation of the murder of the
United States Ambassador. All of these efforts are related to what he sees as his most important
role, rebuilding the confidence of the international business community in its ability to operate in
Libya safely and efficiently. To this end he does agree with Abushagur that it is important to
replace the cabinet of former Prime Minister Abdel Rahman el-Keib, particularly Minister of Oil
Abdulrahrnan Ben Yazza, whose connections to the regime of former dictator Muammar al
Qaddafi, and the Italian Oil firm ENI made him unacceptable to the JCP and other conservative
parties. That said, this individual notes that Magariaf was surprised and not pleased with the
appointment to the ministry of Mabrouk Issa Abu Harroura, another technical expert, who
previously worked for Libya's Zueitina Oil Company as well as in the oil sector abroad.
Magariaf feels that Abu Harroura does not have the standing among the foreign oil companies
that Ben Yezza enjoyed, although he was more acceptable to a number of the conservative
members of the GNC.
5. Magariaf was pleased that the Prime Minister, after dramatic confrontations with MPs
and demonstrators who entered the GNC chamber, withdrew his cabinet nominations. The

President again advised Abushagur to name former Oil and Finance Minister Ali Tarhouni to the
Oil Ministry post; however, he fears that that Ali Tarhouni is seen as too close to Western
governments to gain acceptance in the GNC. Magariaf is concerned that, while the new cabinet
Abushagur plans to put forward on October 7 may contain some members of the NFA and other
moderate groups, it will still be dominated by the JCP and conservative elements, and will again
fail to gain acceptance, leading to a real government crisis.
6. According to this individual Magariaf and his advisors knew in advance that more
than 100 protesters planned to enter the GNC session on October 4, in an effort to prevent MPs
from convening to vote on the new cabinet. While Magariaf did not directly influence these
protesters he did nothing to warn or advise Abushagur on the developing situation. In particular,
the protestors objected to the failure of the Prime Minister to name any minister from the Zawiya
region. Although the demonstrators eventually left the hall, a number of the independent MPs,
who had said they would support the new cabinet, were shaken by the incident and changed their
positions. In the end, according to this individual, Abushagur's efforts to rally their support
failed, and he was forced to withdraw all of the nominees, promising to submit a new list on
October 7, one that would take into account regional and political considerations.
7. In the opinion of a particularly sensitive source, the failure of Abushagur to name any
NFA ministers to the new cabinet will continue to complicate the matter. For his part Magariaf
is concerned over international perceptions regarding the nature of the new Libyan government.
In this regard, he fears that the Western press is too sharply focused on the fact that the NFA
holds the largest single bloc of votes in the GNC (38), missing the fact that the real power in the
parliament lies with the 120 independent deputies, who tend to be somewhat conservative on
religious and social matters, while focusing primarily on local political issues. Magariaf believes
that the appointment of Ali Tarhouni, or another liberal not associated with the NFA, would
serve to reassure Western business and government leaders while demonstrating political balance
to the Libyan people. Although he continues to make this point, the President has no indication
that Abushagur will follow his advice. He does expect Abushagur to again select a majority of
cabinet ministers associated with the MB and the JCP.

1.As of October 5, 2012 Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf, the new interim President of Libya
told senior advisors that the abortive efforts to form a cabinet under new Prime Minister Mustafa
Abushagur represent the first step in the next phase of the struggle for control of the new Libyan
Government. According to a sensitive source Magariaf is concerned that Abushagur, supported by the
Muslim Brotherhood's (MB) Justice and Construction Party (JCP), as well as certain of the other
more traditional Islamist groups, is looking to establish day to day administrative control the new
government while defining Magariaf as a ceremonial Head of State.
2. According to this individual, the President, who is not affiliated with a particular party
holding seats in the General National Council (GNC), spoke with the new Prime Minister immediately
after Abushagur was elected by the GNC on September 12. At that time Magariaf advised him to

Magariaf was not aware of the fact that Jibril had already demanded 9 cabinet seats for the NFA;

Subject: Saudi Grand Mufti calls attacks on foreign embassies un-islamic (Reuters)
RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Ara.bia's Grand Mufti, the highest religious authority in the birthplace of Islam, on
Saturday denounced attacks on diplomats and embassies as un-Islamic after deadly protests against a U.S.-made
film mocking Islam's founder.
Sheikh Abdulaziz bin Abdullah Al al-Sheikh also called on governments and international bodies to
criminalise insults against prophets and excoriated the film that has prompted a wave of fury across the Middle
East.
"It is forbidden to punish the innocent for the wicked crimes of the guilty, or to attack those who have been
granted protection of their lives and property, or to expose public buildings to fire or destruction," he said in a
speech carried by state news agency SPA.
Describing the release of the crudely made short film as "miserable" and "criminal", he added that attacks on
the innocent and diplomats "are also a distortion of the Islamic religion and are not accepted by God".
At least nine people were killed after noon prayers on Friday in demonstrations across the Middle East.

Romney to compare Benghazi to original 9111 attacks
Posted: 07Oct 2012 05:01 PM PDT
In a speech Monday, former Governor Mitt Romney will criticize President Barack Obama's handling of the
Sept. it, 2012,attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi and say it was probably the work of aI Qaeda, the same group
that brought down the World Trade Center and struck the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001.
"The attacks on America last month should not be seen as random acts. They are expressions of a larger struggle
that is playing out across the broader Middle East -- a region that is now in the midst of the most profound upheaval
in a century. Arid the fault lines of this struggle can be seen clearly M Benghazi itself," Romney will say in a foreign-
policy-focused address at the Virginia Military Institute, according to excerpts released by his campaign.

"The attack on our consulate in Benghazi on Sept. nth, 2012, was likely the work of the same forces that attacked
our homeland on Sept. nth, 2001. This latest assault cannot be blamed on a reprehensible video insulting Islam,
despite the administration's attempts to convince us of that for so long. No, as the administration has finally
conceded, these attacks were the deliberate work of terrorists who use violence to impose their dark ideology on
others, especially women and girls; who are fighting to control much of the Middle East today; and who seek to
wage perpetual war on the West."
Some in the U.S. intelligence community believe that the attack on the Benghazi consulate that killed Amb.
Chris Stevens and three other Americans was led by the Benghazi chapter of Ansar al-Sharia, an extremist group
thought to have ties to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb (AQIM), al Qaeda's North Africa affiliate.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton suggested that groups with links to AQIM were responsible for the Beghazi
attack in remarks at a U.N. meeting on Sept. 26, but State Department and White House spokepersons have
repeated again and again that the precise identity of the attackers remains unknown pending an FBI investigation.
Romney will invoke the original 9/n attacks as part of his argument that Obama has failed to respond to the rapid
changes in the Middle East with a proactive and coherent strategy to preserve American power and influence in the
region.
"I know the president hopes for a safer, freer, and a more prosperous Middle East allied with the United States. I
share this hope. But hope is not a strategy," Romney will say. "We cannot support our friends and defeat our
enemies in the Middle East when our words are not backed up by deeds, when our defense spending is being
arbitrarily and deeply cut, when we have no trade agenda to speak of, and the perception of our strategy is not one
of partnership, but of passivity.... It is time to change course in the Middle East."
Romney will promise to increase and tighten sanctions against Iran, permanently base one aircraft carrier group
each in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Gulf, condition aid to Egypt, and "recommit America to the goal of a
democratic, prosperous Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with the Jewish state of Israel."
On Syria, Romney will promise to identify opposition groups that share American values and make sure they get
weapons to defeat the Syrian regime's tanks, helicopters, and fighter jets. He won't say that the United States should
arm the rebels directly -- only that it should make sure they get advanced weaponry.
On Afghanistan, Romney will accuse Obama of timing the withdrawal of U.S. forces based on political
considerations, a reference to the fact that Obama withdrew all 30,000 "surge" forces last month. But Romney will
reiterate his call to complete the withdrawal of combat troops by the end of 2014, so long as the conditions on the
ground permit and in consultation with the military chain of command.
"I believe that if America does not lead, others will -- others who do not share our interests and our values -- and the
world will grow darker, for our friends and for us. America's security and the cause of freedom cannot afford four
more years like the last four years," Romney will say. "The 21st century can and must be an American century. It
began with terror, war, and economic calamity. It is our duty to steer it onto the path of freedom, peace, and
prosperity."

The Romney campaign held a conference call for reporters Sunday to preview the speech, which included
participation by campaign foreign-policy coordinator Alex Wong and senior advisors Rich Williamson and
Eliot Cohen.
Wong said that Obama has stepped away from American leadership and undermined the basis of American power.
He also said the standing of the United States has been weakened in every region of the world, and likened Obama's
foreign policy to that of former President Jimmy Carter.
Williamson said that Obama has a policy of weakness that is provocative to enemies and that his administration
hasn't been transparent on the Benghazi attacks.
"The foreign policy of Barack Obama in the Middle East is a mess and is failing, and that should be a part of the
discussion," Williamson said.
The Obama campaign preemptively released a statement calling Romney a neophyte and flip-fiopper on foreign
policy who has fumbled his forays into foreign-policy issues throughout the campaign.
"If Mitt Romney wants to have a debate about foreign policy, we have a message for him: bring it on... To date, all
Mitt Romney has offered is bluster and platitudes. He's erratically shifted positions on every major foreign policy
issue, including intervening in Libya, which he was against before he was for," Obama for America spokeswoman
Liz Smith said in the statement.
"Mainstream' foreign policy isn't what Mitt Romney is putting forward: having plans to start wars but not end
them; wanting to keep 30,000 U.S. troops in Iraq indefinitely; exploding our defense spending to levels the
Pentagon has not asked for, with no way to pay for it; insulting our allies and partners around the world on the
campaign trail; and calling Russia our number-one geopolitical foe. If that's where Mitt Romney thinks the
mainstream is, he needs to find a better compass. It's clear that on every measure, Mitt Romney fails the
commander-in-chief test."

LIBYNGREAT BRITAIN/FRANCE
On the morning of April 8, an individual with direct access to the leadership of the Libyan National Council (LNC) stated in
strictest confidence that members of the Military Committee of the LNC are concerned that despite the involvement of
NATO against the forces of Muammar Qacidafi, the government of Great Britain is using its intelligence services in an
effort to dictate the actions of both the LNC and the Qaddafi regime. These individuals add that they have been informed
by contacts in France and Italy that while they have been engaged in discussions with the LNC regarding possible
assistance, British diplomats and intelligence officers have maintained contact with members of the Qadclafi government,
in an effort to protect the British position in the event the rebellion settles into a stalemate. These LNC officials believe
that the defection of Libyan Minister of Foreign Affairs Mouse Kousa to the United Kingdom was part of this effort By the
same token they believe that British intelligence officers are in discussion with associates of Safi al-Islam Qaddafi,
regarding future relations between the two countries if he takes over power from his father and implements reforms.
According to these individuals, senior LNC military personnel suspect that despite early indications that they would
provide clandestine military support to the rebels; neither the French nor the British government will provide the rebels
with enough equipment and training to defeat Qaddafi's forces. They also believe that the French. British, and other
European countries will be satisfied with a stalemate that leaves Libya divided into two rival entities.
(Source Comment: in the opinion of these individuals the LNC military leaders are considering the possibility of hiring
private security firms to help train and organize their forces_ One of these individuals added that a number of the LNC
members believe that this solution may be best for the rebels; noting that if they accept clandestine aid from France
and/or Great Britain those two countries will be in a position to control the development of post-Qaddafi Libya)

1.With little hope of achieving a quick military victory, the LNC is deploying a three part strategy; leveraging tribal
relationships, oil production and diplomatic pressure to get the better of Qaddafi. A former spokesman for the Libyan
Human Rights League (LHRL) in Europe, Ali Ziciane, is in talks with representatives of tribes in Sebha and Sirte in an
effort to persuade them to rally to the revolution and the LNC before fighting actually reaches their regions. Zidane is a
candidate to be the Minister of the Interior in the "new Libya." Among his close associates is Mohamed Allagui, president
of the LHRL, who is interested in the justice portfolio in the future, transition government
2. At the same time, All Tarhouni, the LNC's financial expert and possibly Finance Minister in post-Qaddafi Libya, is
struggling to get oil exports back on track in eastern Libya, with backing from the United States and Qatar. The LNC
believes that the U.S. will focus on restarting operations at the oil terminal in TGWU*, and an American envoy is expected
in Benghazi in the near future to facilitate this process. For its part, Qatar is advancing cash to the LNG to stimulate the
shipment of oil from eastern Libya. Some commodity traders stepped in recently (under contract from Qatar) to deliver
refined oil products to the insurgents. VITOL and the Swiss firm GLENCORE are operating in the rebel zone, but denied
any involvement in this shipment.
Elsewhere, these sources add that Materna:I Shannmarn is overseeing the information and communications campaign for
the rebels against Qaddafi. Considered one of the LNC most important leaders, Shammam brings to the insurgency the
expertise he acquired while working forVoice of America, Foreign Policy, Newsweek and Al Jazeera. Shammarri lived in
the U.S. for more than twenty years, and he is believed to have excellent connections in the U.S. Government.
3. Islamist activity: Libya's Islamist activists have maintained a low profile since the start of the insurgency in late
February; fearing that their activities would give credence to Qaddafi's claims that the rebels are terrorists. As the LNC is
taking shape, they are now working to make their voice heard, and influence events within the LNC, All Saliabi, Salem Al
Shiki and Mohamed Al Guirtili, leading Islamic figures who had taken refuge in London (and are close to the Moslem
Brotherhood), drafted a "national pact" which looks like a road map for organizing the role of the Islamist movement in the
transition to a post — Qaddafi Libya,
Sallabi and his two associates draw their inspiration from the "February 17 Movement' which helped spark the uprising by
commemorating the massacre of Islamist prisoners at the Abu Salim prison in 1996. Prior to the current rebellion,
Mustapha Abdel Jail!, the President of the LNC and former Minister of Justice called for the release of reformed Islamists.
At present, the Islamists are handicapped by the fact they supported Saifs reform projects before the recent crisis. Saif
played a crucial part in getting the Islamists to sever ties between the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group's and al Qa'ida in the
Islamic Maghreb (AQIM).
EGYPT AND LIBYA:
A source with excellent access to the highest levels of the SUPREME COUNCIL OF THE ARMED FORCES (SCAF)
states that the Egyptian Military has turned its full attention to the crisis in Libya. Traditionally, Egypt is a strong influence
in the eastern Libyan region of Cyrenaica and is now taking advantage of the current crisis to regain that position.
Regardless of whether Muammar Qaddafi remains in power or not, the political division of Libya will give Egypt the
opportunity to fill the void in the east. A senior diplomatic source reported that since the early days of the Libyan crisis, the
Egyptian government has been quietly supporting Libyan opposition forces through training, weaponry, food, and medical
supplies, while attempting to organize a political structure in the east. In addition, Egyptian Special Operations troops are
serving with mitel forces in the eastern part of Libya. Senior Egyptian military officers stated privately that these troops
are responsible for many of the rebel's combat successes.
The following factors are the focus of Egypt's plans for a post-Qaddafi regime:
-Avoiding a refugee crisis. In the event Qaddaffs forces invade the east, Egypt is the most logical destination for
refugees from Libyan. Egypt has an interest in controlling any turmoil in Libya that could harm efforts to restart its
struggling economy.
-Labor market. Libya is an important market for unemployed Egyptian laborers. According to the Egyptian Labor
Ministry, around 1.5 million Egyptians reside and work in Libya, sending home an estimated $254 million in remittances.
In the past few years, Qaddafi has placed heavy restrictions on foreign workers, and Egypt hopes that a new regime will
be more flexible, and open to receiving Egyptian workers.
-Radical Islamists. Traditionally, the eastern part of Libya has been a stronghold for radical Islamist groups, including
the al Qaida-linked Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. While Qadclafi's regime has been successful in suppressing the
jihadist threat in Libya, the current situation opens the door for jihadist resurgence. Egypt has a growing interest in
keeping a close eye on jihadist movements in eastern Libya. This is especially true as the Egyptian Military is already

concerned about Islamist militancy overflow from Gaza, after their forces were pulled back to Cairo during the uprising
against Mubarak.
-Oil and energy resources. Egypt has strong economic interests in the oil rich eastern part of Libya. Any opportunity to
gain direct or indirect access to these energy resources will increase Egypt's wealth.
-Regional power. The Egypt's military-led government is looking to reestablish their country's role in the Arab world. So
far, Egypt has fostered discussions in the Palestinian territories between Fatah and 1-lamas, while reaching out to Syria
and Saudi Arabia on the issue of Iran.
(Source Comment According to a sensitive diplomatic source, the current Egyptian diplomatic strategy is to enhance its
stature by defending the Libyan people against Qaddafi's regime, while at the same time, distancing itself from any
military intervention led by the region's former colonial powers in Europe.)
It should be noted that, in the opinion of knowledgeable sources, Egypt cannot count on the support of every Arab power
in the region. Egypt led the call for imposing the no-fly zone in Libya, while Algeria, while Yemen, and Syria voted against
it. These countries (especially Yemen) fear the precedence that would be created for their own governments in the event
Qaddati is ousted.
(Source Comment: A source with access to the leadership of NATO state in confidence that their information indicates
that Syria and Algeria are concerned with Egypt's revival in the region. This source stated that a de facto split between
eastern and western Libya would give Egypt the opportunity to reassume an influential position in Cyrenaica.)

Subject: McCain update
The Watch received the following readout of CODEL McCain's April 23 meetings in Cairo.
Foreign Minister Alaraby:
McCain discussed his visit to Libya, emphasizing it appeared a stalemate was emerging. McCain supported the
decision to send in predator drones and would like NATO to provide equipment, as well as training, to the rebel
forces. McCain characterized the TNC as "good people," but said its military was far less impressive.
Regarding the possibility of Egypt increasing aid to the TNC, Alaraby said Egypt was reluctant to provide additional
support out of concern for the estimated 1 million Egyptian nationals living in Libya.
Alaraby reiterated Egypt is in no rush to restore diplomatic relations with Iran.
Alaraby said Egypt will abide by all agreements made with Israel. He encouraged the United States to support, or
at least not oppose, recognition of Palestinian statehood in the UN.
McCain said the USG had discussed a modest assistance package for Egypt, but warned it was probably more
modest than Egypt wished given the current economic climate. McCain planned to organize a group of businessmen to
visit Egypt and encouraged Alaraby to create a more pro-business environment.
Defense Minister, Field Marshall Tantawi:
The meeting focused on Libya and strategies to increase U.S. and Egyptian assistance. The discussion was not as in
depth as McCain's meeting with the FM. Tantawi echoed Alaraby's concern about Egyptian nationals in Libya and
request for increased U.S. assistance.

Re: Bin Laden, AQ & Libya
Latest report:
During the early morning of May 2, 2011 sources with access to the leadership of the Libyan rebellion's ruling Transitional
National Council (TNC) stated in confidence that they are concerned that the death of al Qa'ida leader Osama Bin Laden
will inspire al Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) to use weapons they have obtained, which were originally intended
for the rebels in Libya, to retaliate against the United States and its allies for this attack in Pakistan. These individuals fear
that the use of the weapons in this manner will complicate the INC 's relationship with NATO and the United States,
whose support is vital to them in their struggle with the forces of Muarnmar al Qaddafi. In this regard they are concerned
that U.S. officials will believe reports, often created by the Tripoli Government, regarding the degree of influence exercised
by AQIM on the INC.
These individuals note that the TNC officials are reacting to reports received during the week of April 25 from their own
sources of information, the French General Directorate for External Security (DGSE), and British external intelligence
service (MI-6), stating that AQIM has acquired about 10 SAM 7- Grail/Streela man-portable air-defense systems
(MANPADS or MPADS) from illegal weapons markets in Western Niger and Northern Mali. These weapons were
originally intended for sale to the rebel forces in Libya, but AQIM operatives were able to meet secretly with these arms
dealers and purchase the equipment. The acquisition of these sophisticated weapons creates a serious threat to air traffic
in Southern Morocco, Algeria, Northern Mali, Western Niger, and Eastern Mauritania.
(Source Comment. According to very sensitive sources, the Libyan rebels are concerned that AQIM may also obtain
SPIGOTT wire-guided anti-tank missiles and an unspecified number of Russian anti-tank mines made of plastic and
undetectable by anti-mine equipment. This equipment again was coming through Niger and Mali, and was intended for the
rebels in Libya. They note that AQIM is very strong in this region of Northwest Africa.)

In the opinion of these knowledgeable individuals, Libyan rebel commanders are also concerned that the death of Bin
Laden comes at a time when sensitive information indicates that the leaders of AQIM are planning to launch attacks
across North Africa and Eurcipe in an effort to reassert their relevance during the ongoing upheavals in Libya, as well as
the rest of North Africa and the Middle East. They believe the first step in this campaign was the April 30 bombing of a
cafe in Marrakesh, Morocco that is frequented by Western tourists. These individuals point out that AQIM also maintains
a wide reach in Europe.
The TNC leaders are also concerned that, with the death of Saif al-Arab Qaddafi, the youngest son of Muammar Qaddafi,
the Tripoli Government may pursue retaliation against the United States and its Western allies through surrogate terrorist
groups, particularly Hezbollah. While the deaths of Bin Laden and Saif al-Arab are completely unrelated, two separate
and very dangerous groups will now be looking for revenge against the U.S. and its allies.
(Source Comment: These knowledgeable sources believe that the leaders of the INC are also worried about the reaction
to the death of Bin Laden among rebel fighters and their supporters in Libya and Egypt, where the al Qa'ida leader was
very popular. These TNC officials do not want the death of Bin Laden to affect their relations with the West or their
support from NATO, the U.S., France, or Great Britain.)

groups, particularly Hezbollah, While the deaths of Bin Laden and Sag al-Arab are completely unrelated, two separate
and very dangerous groups will now be looking for revenge against the U.S. and its allies.
(Source Comment: These knowledgeable sources believe that the leaders of the INC are also worried about the reaction
to the death of Bin Laden among rebel fighters and their supporters in Libya and Egypt, where the al Qa'ida leader was
very popular. These TNC officials do not want the death of Bin Laden to affect their relations with the West or their
support from NATO, the U.S., France, or Great Britain.)

Re: Bin Laden, AQ & Libya
Latest report:
During the early morning of May 2, 2011 sources with access to the leadership of the Libyan
rebellion's ruling Transitional National Council (TNC) stated in confidence that they are
concerned that the death of al Qa'ida leader Osama Bin Laden will inspire al Qa'ida in the
Islamic Maghreb (AQD/1) to use weapons they have obtained, which were originally intended for
the rebels in Libya, to retaliate against the United States and its allies for this attack in Pakistan
These individuals fear that the use of the weapons in this manner will complicate the TNC's
relationship with NATO and the United States, whose support is vital to them in their struggle
with the forces of Muammar al Qaddafi. In this regard they are concerned that U.S. officials will
believe reports, often created by the Tripoli Government, regarding the degree of influence
exercised by AQIM on the TNC.
These individuals note that the TNC officials are reacting to reports received during the week of
April 25 from their own sources of information, the French General Directorate for External
Security (DGSE), and British external intelligence service (M1-6), stating that AQ1M has
acquired about 10 SAM 7- Grail/Streela man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS or
MPADS) from illegal weapons markets in Western Niger and Northern Mali. These weapons
were originally intended for sale to the rebel forces in Libya, but AQIM operatives were able to
meet secretly with these arms dealers and purchase the equipment. The acquisition of these
sophisticated weapons creates a serious threat to air traffic in Southern Morocco, Algeria,
Northern Mali, Western Niger, and Eastern Mauritania.
(Source Comment. According to very sensitive sources, the Libyan rebels are concerned that
AQLM may also obtain SPIGOTT wire-guided anti-tank missiles and an unspecified number of
Russian anti-tank mines made of plastic and undetectable by anti-mine equipment This
equipment again was coming through Niger and Mali, and was intended for the rebels in Libya.
They note that AQIM is very strong in this region of Northwest Africa.)

In the opinion of these knowledgeable individuals. Libyan rebel commanders are also concerned
that the death of Bin Laden comes at a time when sensitive information indicates that the leaders
of AQIM are planning to launch attacks across North Africa and Europe in an effort to reassert
their relevance during the ongoing upheavals in Libya, as well as the rest of North Africa and the
Middle East They believe the first step in this campaign was the April 30 bombing of a café in
Marrakesh, Morocco that is frequented by Western tourists. These individuals point out that
AQIM also maintains a wide reach in Europe.
The TNC leaders are also concerned that, with the death of Saif al-Arab Qacklafi, the youngest
son of Muammar Qaddafi, the Tripoli Government may pursue retaliation against the United
States and its Western allies through surrogate terrorist groups, particularly Bezbollah. While
the deaths of Bin Laden and Saif al-Arab are completely unrelated, two separate and very
dangerous groups will now be looking for revenge against the U.S. and its allies.

Libyan Ambassador's Death Not a Political Issue, Says Dad

The father of Christopher Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya who was killed in the attack in Benghazi last month, said
his son's death shouldn't be politicized in the presidential campaign.
"It would really be abhorrent to make this into a campaign issue," Jan Stevens, 77, said in a telephone interview from his
home in Loomis. California, as he prepares for a memorial service for his son next week.
Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, has criticized President Barack ()barna for not providing adequate security in
Libya, saying the administration has left the country exposed to a deadly terrorist attack.
The ambassador's father, a lawyer, said politicians should await the findings of a formal investigation before making
accusations or judgments.
"The security matters are being adequately investigated," Stevens said. "We don't pretend to be experts in security. It
has to be objectively examined. That's where it belongs. It does not belong in the campaign arena," Stevens said he has
been getting briefings from the State Department on the progress of the investigation.

'Very Optimistic'
Stevens said while he was dose with his son, "we weren't that familiar with the day-to-day activities' he undertook in
Libya. On the occasions when his son called home, Stevens said, he didn't share many details about his work other than
to say that "he was very optimistic about the results of the election and the new government." They last spoke by phone
in August and by e-mail days before his son's death.
Stevens, a registered Democrat, said he isn't politically active. He declined to say how he'll vote in the presidential
election.
He said his son, who was a career diplomat and had worked for Republican and Democratic presidents, hadn't expressed
concerns to him about security or support from the administration. "He felt very strongly about Secretary Clinton,"
Stevens said, referring to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. "He felt she was an extremely able person."
As for whether he had the tools and protection he needed for his job, Stevens said of his son: "We didn't get into that"
sort of discussion. "I never heard him say a critical word about the State Department or the administration, or any
administration for that matter, He came up through the foreign service, not politics."
Obama Call
Stevens said neither of the two presidential campaigns reached out to him, and that he is grateful for that. He said
Obama telephoned him after his son's death to express his regrets and talk about identifying the perpetrators who
should be brought to justice, and that the conversation was in the context of his presidential duties and not political.
While polls indicate that voters say Obama would do a better job on foreign policy issues, Republicans see an
opportunity to cut into that advantage, pointing to surveys showing that voters have grown less satisfied since the Sept.
11 assault in Libya.
Stevens stopped short of directly criticizing either candidate.
"I'm not sure exactly what he's been saying and not saying, but our position is it would be a real shame if this were
politicized," Stevens said, referring to Romney. Our concern now is memorializing Chris and remembering his
contribution to the country."
Campaign Shift
Romney's current foreign policy position marks a shift in tone from a campaign that has focused almost exclusively on
economic issues arid jobs.
The Romney team is attempting to link two campaign messages by charging Obama with weakening American interests
abroad at the same time as he's failed to boost the economy back home.
Speaking to voters on Oct. 12 in Richmond, Virginia, Romney chastised Vice President Joe Biden for his defense of the
administration's actions in the Libya attack.
"He's doubling down on denial, and we need to understand exactly what happened as opposed to just having people
brush this aside," Romney said.
During last week's vice presidential debate, Biden said the White House wasn't told of a request for additional security
at the mission in Benghazi the month before the incident.

State Department official Eric Nordstrom, who served as a regional security officer in Tripoli until July, told a
congressional committee that he was turned down when he requested an extension of a 16-member security support
team that was scheduled to leave Libya in August.
'Mission Creep'
Romney hasn't specified what he would do differently than the administration In Libya. In a speech at the Virginia
Military Institute earlier last week, he called for support of Libya's "efforts to forge a lasting government" and to pursue
the "terrorists who attacked our consulate."
That view is at odds with the position Romney took more than a year ago, when he opposed expanding the intervention
in Libya to capture Muammar Qaddafi, calling it "mission creep and mission muddle" in April 2011.
Neither the administration's initial public report that the attack began with a spontaneous demonstration against an
anti- Islamic video clip nor Republican suggestions that it was a planned attack tied to al-Qaeda are supported by U.S.
intelligence reports or by accounts of the night provided to a Bloomberg reporter by Benghazi residents.
White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters that "the president wants to get to the bottom of what
happened."
Carney also sought to minimize questions about why the president and other administration officials were slow to
publicly acknowledge the role of terrorism in the attack.
"As time went on, additional information became available," Carney said. "Clearly, we know more today than we did on
the Sunday after the attack. But as the process moves forward and more information becomes available, we will be sure
to continue consulting with you."

Re: Q's secret bid to UK
On the morning of June 2, 2011 sensitive sources with access to the advisors to Muammar Qaddafi's son, Saif
al-Islam, stated in strict confidence that the Libyan government has opened extremely complicated negotiations
with the government of the United Kingdom (UK) in an effort to obtain their support in reaching a ceasefire
agreement with the rebels of the Libyan Transitional National Council (TNC), allowing the Qaddafi's to
maintain some level of control in the country.
This initiative is directed by Saif al-Islam and, according to these sensitive sources, the Libyans have asked the
UK officials to broker a deal with the TNC that will allow some form of power sharing, with the possibility of
Saif al-Islam acting as head of state and the TNC members making up a substantial portion of the cabinet in a
new government. Under the plan Muammar Qaddafi would be allowed to leave the country and go into exile
with no danger of indictment on charges of human rights abuses and corruption by Libyan or international
courts
(Source Comment: In the opinion of these sensitive sources, this initiative reflects the concern of the Qaddafi
government that as a result of continuing NATO air raids against their forces, they can no longer defeat the

rebel army. They add that there has been no firm response from the UK government, and the initial discussions
have been conducted by officers of the British Special Intelligence Service (SIS / In the opinion of these
same sources the initial idea of these talks may have been raised by former Libyan Foreign Minister Mousa
Kousa, after his arrival in London in late March 2011.)
According to these sensitive sources, Saif al-Islam and his advisors realize that there is little chance the TNC
will agree to such an offer, and that SIS may be using this contact as a means of collecting intelligence while
protecting British interests in Libya. Notwithstanding this concern, in the opinion of these individuals, Saif al-
Islam believes that introducing the possibility of a ceasefire and the subsequent negotiations may create
divisions within NATO and weaken their military operations against Qaddafi's forces.
(Source Comment. These sources add that many of Saif al-Islam's advisors do not know if, or to what extent,
the UK Government has shared knowledge of this initiative with the governments of the United States and the
other NATO allies.)
At the same time, sources with access to the operations of the TNC military committee state privately that on
June 1, 2011 Libyan intelligence officers detonated a car bomb outside the Tibesti Hotel in the TNC capital of
Benghazi. One person was injured in the blast and a number of nearby vehicles were damaged. TNC security
officers occupied the hotel and the surrounding area immediately after the attack, but were not able to identify
any of the attackers. The Tibesti Hotel is an important landmark in the heart of Benghazi and is used by the
INC government, as well by foreign journalists and diplomats. Hotel security has been heightened in the hours
following the attack and all foreign residents are under surveillance by TNC security officers, looking for
suspicious activities and contacts.

Romney's current foreign policy position marks a shift in tone from a campaign that has focused almost exclusively on
economic issues and jobs.
The Romney team is attempting to link two campaign messages by charging Obama with weakening American interests
abroad at the same time as he's failed to boost the economy back home.
Speaking to voters on Oct. 12 in Richmond, Virginia, Romney chastised Vice President Joe Biden for his defense of the
administration's actions in the Libya attack.
"He's doubling down on denial, and we need to understand exactly what happened as opposed to just having people
brush this aside," Romney said.
During last week's vice presidential debate, Biden said the White House wasn't told of a request for additional security
at the mission in Benghazi the month before the incident.
State Department official Eric Nordstrom, who served as a regional security officer in Tripoli until July, told a
congressional committee that he was turned down when he requested an extension of a 16-member security support
team that was scheduled to leave Libya in August.
'Mission Creep'
Romney hasn't specified what he would do differently than the administration in Libya. In a speech at the Virginia
Military Institute earlier last week, he called for support of Libya's "efforts to forge a lasting government" and to pursue
the "terrorists who attacked our consulate."
That view is at odds with the position Romney took more than a year ago, when he opposed expanding the intervention
in Libya to capture Muammar Qaddafi, calling it "mission creep and mission muddle" in April 2011.
Neither the administration's initial public report that the attack began with a spontaneous demonstration against an
anti- Islamic video clip nor Republican suggestions that it was a planned attack tied to al-Qaeda are supported by U.S.
intelligence reports or by accounts of the night provided to a Bloomberg reporter by Benghazi residents.
White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters that "the president wants to get to the bottom of what
happened."
Carney also sought to minimize questions about why the president and other administration officials were slow to
publicly acknowledge the role of terrorism in the attack.
"As time went on, additional information became available," Carney said. "Clearly, we know more today than we did on
the Sunday after the attack. But as the process moves forward and more information becomes available, we will be sure
to continue consulting with you."

Dear Mr. Sullivan,
As per your request, here is the transcript from Ambassador Rice's appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press." We will
forward the transcripts from the other Sunday morning shows as we receive them. Thank you.
Announcer: From NBC News in Washington, MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory.
GREGORY: And good morning. Relative calm this morning in the Middle East after several days of
intense anti-American protests raged across many parts of the Islamic world. But word this morning
that the Obama administration has ordered the evacuation of all but emergency personnel from
diplomatic missions in Tunisia and Sudan. And defense secretary Leon Panetta saying this morning,
the Pentagon has deployed forces to several areas in an increased effort to protect U.S. personnel
and property from the potential of violent protests, the latest consequences, of course, of this
troubling unrest. Joining me now for the very latest, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
Susan Rice. Ambassador Rice, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS.
MS. SUSAN RICE (U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations): Thank you, good to be here.
GREGORY: The images as you well know are jarring to Americans watching all of this play out this
week, and we'll share the map of all of this turmoil with our viewers to show the scale of it across not
just the Arab world, but the entire Islamic world and flashpoints as well. In Egypt, of course, the

protests outside the U.S. embassy there that Egyptian officials were slow to put down. This weekend
in Pakistan, protests as well there. More anti-American rage. Also protests against the drone
strikes. In Yemen, you also had arrests and some deaths outside of our U.S. embassy there. How
much longer can Americans expect to see these troubling images and these protests go forward?
MS. RICE: Well, David, we can't predict with any certainty. But let's remember what has transpired
over the last several days. This is a response to a hateful and offensive video that was widely
disseminated throughout the Arab and Muslim world. Obviously, our view is that there is absolutely
no excuse for violence and that-- what has happened is condemnable, but this is a-- a spontaneous
reaction to a video, and it's not dissimilar but, perhaps, on a slightly larger scale than what we have
seen in the past with The Satanic Verses with the cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. Now, the
United States has made very clear and the president has been very plain that our top priority is the
protection of American personnel in our facilities and bringing to justice those who...
GREGORY: All right.
MS RICE: ...attacked our facility in Benghazi.
GREGORY: Well, let's talk-- talk about-- well, you talked about this as spontaneous. Can you say
definitively that the attacks on-- on our consulate in Libya that killed ambassador Stevens and others
there security personnel, that was spontaneous, was it a planned attack? Was there a terrorist
element to it?
MS. RICE: Well, let us-- let me tell you the-- the best information we have at present. First of all,
there's an FBI investigation which is ongoing. And we look to that investigation to give us the
definitive word as to what transpired. But putting together the best information that we have available
to us today our current assessment is that what happened in Benghazi was in fact initially a
spontaneous reaction to what had just transpired hours before in Cairo, almost a copycat of-- of the
demonstrations against our facility in Cairo, which were prompted, of course, by the video. What we
think then transpired in Benghazi is that opportunistic extremist elements came to the consulate as
this was unfolding. They came with heavy weapons which unfortunately are readily available in post
revolutionary Libya. And it escalated into a much more violent episode. Obviously, that's-- that's our
best judgment now. We'll await the results of the investigation. And the president has been very
clear--we'll work with the Libyan authorities to bring those responsible to justice.
GREGORY: Was there a failure here that this administration is responsible for, whether it's an
intelligence failure, a failure to see this coming, or a failure to adequately protect U.S. embassies and
installations from a spontaneous kind of reaction like this?

MS. RICE: David, I don't think so. First of all we had no actionable intelligence to suggest that-- that
any attack on our facility in Benghazi was imminent. In Cairo, we did have indications that there was
the risk that the video might spark some— some protests and our embassy, in fact, acted accordingly,
and had called upon the Egyptian authorities to-- to reinforce our facility. What we have seen as--
with respect to the security response, obviously we had security personnel in Benghazi, a-- a
significant number, and tragically, among those four that were killed were two of our security
personnel. But what happened, obviously, overwhelmed the security we had in place which is why
the president ordered additional reinforcements to Tripoli and-- and why elsewhere in the world we
have been working with governments to ensure they take up their obligations to protect us and we
reinforce where necessary.
GREGORY: The president and the secretary of state have talked about a mob mentality. That's my
words, not their words, but they talked about the— the tyranny of mobs operating in this part of the
world. Here's the reality, if you look at foreign aid--U.S. direct foreign aid to the two countries
involved here, in Libya and Egypt, this is what you'd see: two hundred million since 2011 to Libya,
over a billion a year to Egypt and yet Americans are seeing these kinds of protests and attacks on our
own diplomats. Would-- what do you say to members of congress who are now weighing whether to
suspend our aid to these countries if this is the response that America gets?
MS. RICE: Well, first of all. David, let's put this in perspective. As I said, this is a response to a-- a
very offensive video. It's not the first time that American facilities have come under attack in the
Middle East, going back to 1982 in-- in Beirut, going back to the Khobar Towers in-- in Saudi Arabia,
or even the attack on our embassy in 2008 in Yemen.
GREGORY: Or Iran in 1979.
MS. RICE: This has-- this has happened in the past, but there-- and so I don't think that-- that we
should misunderstand what this is. The reason we provide aid in Egypt and in Libya is because it
serves American interests because the relationships...
GREGORY: But— but our Americans are not being served if this is the response.
MS. RICE: It serves our interests to have Egypt willing and able to— to maintain its peace treaty with
Israel, it servers our interest for Egypt to continue to be a strong partner. Now, let's be clear, the
government, once President Obama called President Morsi, immediately in Egypt the security forces
came out and have provided very significant protection. Same in Tunisia, same in Libya, same in
Yemen. And all of these leaders have very forcefully conveyed their condemnation of what has
transpired.

GREGORY: But there were conflicting messages from the Morsi government. In Arabic they
encourage protests, in English they said stop the protests. This from an ally that we give over a
billion dollars?
MS. RICE: What has happened in fact is that the Egyptian government has come out and protected
our facilities. Our embassy is open today, things are calm. And Morsi has repeatedly been clear in
his condemnation of-- of what has occurred. We-- we are in these partnerships, David, over the long-
term. We think that-- that— despite this very bumpy path we're on and the very disturbing images
we've seen, it's in the United States fundamental interest that people have the ability to choose their
own governments, that the governments be democratic and free. That's in our long-term best
interest.
GREGORY: You know that this„.
MS. RICE: We need to reinforce that with our assistance.
GREGORY: We are in the middle of a heated presidential campaign, there are different foreign
policy visions. That's why we wanted to dedicate the hour to this today to really understand these
different views, Mitt Romney spoke out this week, he criticized the administration, talked about
whether the United States was apologizing for some of the initial response to this. These were his
comments this week.
(Videotape; Wednesday)
MR. MITT ROMNEY: The administration was wrong to stand by a statement sympathizing with those
who had breached our embassy in Egypt instead of condemning their actions. I think it's a-- a-- a
terrible course to-- for America to-- to stand in apology for our values.
(End videotape)
GREGORY: Our embassies did not stand up for speech— free speech in this initial response to this
violence. And the Republican charge is that it's weakness on the part of this administration that
invites this kind of chaos, that the administration has not been tough enough on radical extremists
that are beginning to take root in these countries. How do you respond to that
MS. RICE: First of all, I think the American people and certainly our diplomats and-- and
development experts who are putting their lives on the line around the world every day expect from
our leadership unity in times of challenge and strong, steady, steadfast leadership of the sort that
President Obama has been providing. With respect to this, I think, vacuous charge of weakness,

lets— lets recall, I think, the American people fully understand that this is an administration led by a
president who said when he ran for office that he would take the fight to at Qaeda. We have
decimated at Qaeda. Osama bin Laden is dead. He said we would end the war responsibly in
Iraq. We've done that. He has restored relationships around the world. I spend every day up at the
United Nations where I have to interact with 192 other countries. I know how well the United States is
viewed. I know that our standing is much improved and it's translated into important support for
strong American positions, for example with sanctions against Iran.
GREGORY: Was it inappropriate for Governor Romney to level the criticism he leveled?
MS. RICE: I'm not going to get into politics, David. That's not my role in this job. But I think the
American people welcome and appreciate strong, steady, unified leadership, bipartisan in times of
challenge. And for those men and women in our diplomatic service, including those we tragically lost,
they look to our leadership to be unified and responsible.
GREGORY: Let's talk about another area where the administration is on the defensive in terms of
leadership in the world, and that is the nuclear threat from Iran. Another area of tension between the
United States and Israel. In just a couple of minutes we will show our interview with the prime
minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu. And our viewers will see that. One aspect is how close Iran
is getting to becoming a nuclear power. I asked him about that. I want to show you a piece of the
interview and get your reaction to it.
(Videotape)
PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU (Prime Minister of Israel): I can tell you, David, that Iran
has been placed with some clear red lines on a few matters, and they have avoided crossing
them. So I think that as they get closer and closer and closer to the achievement of the weapons-
grade material, and they're very close, they're six months away from being about 90 percent of
having the enriched uranium for an atom bomb, I think that you have to place that red line before
them now, before it's— it's too late.
GREGORY: As the prime minister of Israel, has Iran crossed your red line?
MR. NETANYAHU: Well, the way I would say it, David, is they are in the red zone. You know, they
are in the last 20 yards. And you can't let them cross that goal line. You can't let them score a
touchdown, because that would have unbelievable consequences, grievous consequences, for the
peace and security of us all-- of the world really.

GREGORY: What is President Obama's line in the sand, the point at which he says to Iran don't
cross this with your nuclear program or there's going to be a military consequence?
MS. RICE David, the president has been very, very clear. Our bottom line, if you want to call it a red
line, president's bottom line has been that Iran will not acquire a nuclear weapon and we will take no
option off the table to ensure that it does not acquire a nuclear weapon, including the military option.
GREGORY: The prime minister says...
MS. RICE: But...
GREGORY: ...they are acquiring.
MS. RICE: ...he's talking about a-- a red zone which is a new concept...
GREGORY: No, no, but he's talking about how close they are to actually becoming a nuclear power--
having to develop a capacity to become a nuclear power.
MS. RICE: They're not there yet. They are not there yet. And our assessment is, and-- and we
share this regularly with our Israeli counterparts in the intelligence and defense community, that there
is time and space for the pressure we are mounting, which is unprecedented in terms of sanctions, to
still yield results. This is not imminent. The window is not infinite, but let's be clear—the sanctions
that— that are now in place reached their high point in July. The-- the Iranian economy is
suffering. It's shrinking for the first time. Negative one percent growth. The amount of production of
Iranian oil has dropped 40 percent over the last several months. Their currency has plummeted 40
percent over the last several months. This pressure is even to use the Iranian's own words crippling.
GREGORY: But can you say...
MS. RICE: And we think...
GREGORY: ...that President Obama's strategy to keep Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon almost
at the end of his first term is succeeding or failing?
MS. RICE: David, what is clear is Iran does not have a nuclear weapon. And that Iran is more
isolated than ever internationally. The economic pressure it is facing is much greater than
ever. When President Obama came to office the international community was divided about
Iran. And Iran was internally very united. The exact opposite is the case today. The international
community is united. We just had another strong resolution out of the IAEA Board of Governors. And

the internal dynamics in Iran are-- are fracturing and the leadership is divided. We are committed and
President Obama is committed to preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. It is not a policy
of containment. But, David; the most difficult and profound decision that any president has to make is
the decision to go to war. And this president is committed to exhausting pressure, economic
pressure, and diplomacy while there is— is still time before making a decision of such consequence.
GREGORY: Ambassador Rice, the debate continues. Thank you very much...
MS. RICE: Thank you.
GREGORY: ...for your views this morning.
Now to this looming nuclear threat from Iran from the Israeli perspective, There were new tensions
between the °barna administration in Israel this week. Earlier, I spoke with the prime minister of
Israel Benjamin Netanyahu about where things stand and whether he is trying to influence the
outcome of our presidential campaign.

It is almost inevitable in an election year that Republicans use every possible opportunity to attack the Obama
Administration. Part of these attacks have been effort to embarrass the President by turning the killing of
Ambassador Stevens into a "goteha" contest where the President is somehow blamed for largely local security
decisions and "intelligence failures." The Administration, in turn, has fumbled the situation by going into a state
of confused denial -- focusing on the uncertain chronology of events that led to Ambassador Chris Stevens'
death.

The Republicans seem to be "winning" in political terms, largely because so few Americans in think tanks and
the media realize that virtually all intelligence and security post-mortems on such events uncover the same
problems. Once the event is over and clear patterns emerge, there are always warning indicators that could have
been heeded in retrospect. If one ignores that vast amount of "noise" from other conflicting indicators, and
looks back with 20-20 hindsight, every such event is always an "intelligence" failure.
Moreover, competent security officers always are asking for more support and coverage in any area where risks
exist. There is never enough security even in the best funded times, and these are not the best funded times.
Almost every aspect of U.S. diplomacy has been subject to budget cuts at a time of upheaval in the Arab world
and global economic crisis.
A recent article by Dana Milbank in the Washington Post notes that the same Republican dominated House that
now critiques events in Libya cut State Department operations by $300 million in 2009 and eliminated funds for
some 30 more security positions along with it. The House cut security funding by $128 million in FY2011 and
$331 million in FY2012, although the Senate restored $88 million. Under at least one of Congressman Ryan's
proposals to amend the budget, State Department funding would be cut by an additional 20% million in 2014 –
which means another $400 million cut in security.
It is no tribute to the Obama Administration that it did far too little to push back against these cuts, and even
less to articulate the need to fund stronger U.S. "expeditionary diplomacy" efforts. Indeed, at a time when far
too many countries are in crisis and the U.S. faces increased challenges to its regional goals, more funds,
stronger country teams, increased humanitarian aid, beefed-up military assistance, and on-the-scene diplomacy
is needed to support U.S. interests.
In fairness to Secretary Clinton and the large number of dedicated diplomatic professionals, State has tried to
deal with these challenges by refocusing its diminishing resources, strengthening its ability to provide on-the-
scene aid, and creating civil efforts that can deal with crises like Syria and the need to provide stronger U.S. aid
and advisory teams if dictators like Assad fall.
So far, both the Republican "gotcha" efforts and the Administration's failure to make the case for strong
"expeditionary diplomacy" have totally failed to serve the U.S. national interest, and have been the worst
possible memorial to Ambassador Chris Stevens, a man who clearly knew that America's success required risk
taking and action in the field.
It is time we come to grips with the world we actually live in. We can't deal with the political upheavals in a
single Arab country, the impact of Transition in Afghanistan, the internal struggle for the future of Islam,
energy and trade security, the various national crises in Latin America and Africa, or the competition for the
future of Asia by speeches in the U.S., quick visits by senior U.S. officials, outside radio and TV programs, and
empty rhetoric about taking stronger stands or exporting U.S. values.
We need strong country teams, and teams that are active and take risks. We need men and women on the scene
who accept the realities on the ground in the countries they operate in. We need strong country teams that can
work with the full range of factions, provide help in forming political parties and changing governance, provide
carefully selected aid and advisory efforts to catalyze reform, and provide military and security advisors that
can help countries move towards stability without excessive repression and threatening their neighbors.
We need to protect our embassies, consulates, and military advisory groups, but we cannot afford to turn them
in to fortresses that lock our diplomats, aid teams, and military on the scene away from events and the people
they are trying to influence. If there are any real lessons from Libya —or Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Yemen,
Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and all the other nations on the long list of cases where
American diplomats, advisors and security teams died to serve their country —it is that projecting any form of

smart power is done on the ground, is done by moving throughout the country, is done by taking risks, and will
inevitably incur casualties.
Some will be ambassadors, some will be aid team personnel or experts in public diplomacy, and some will be
CIA or men and women in uniform. Every one of them will be a tragedy. But we cannot let either false
economies or extremist and terrorist threats defeat such efforts. The cost of properly funded expeditionary
diplomacy —people, military and civil aid funds, and fully funded security efforts —is going to be cheaper
even on a global level than losing contact and U.S. influence in a single country like Egypt, or being unprepared
to deal with the flow of events in a nation like Syria or Iraq.
It is also already all too clear that extremist elements throughout the world realize that attacks on U.S. diplomats
and military advisors or partners are one of the cheapest and most effective ways to gain immediate visibility,
strike at the heart of U.S. public opinion, drive the U.S. out of a country, or limit its influence. No one needs to
defeat U.S. military forces — which can only be deployed to a handful of countries at most —if they can expel
or paralyze American diplomacy, support for U.S. businesses and investment, support for U.S. NG0s, and
effective U.S. military and security advisory efforts.
This threat is already all too real in far too many parts of the world, and it has effectively eliminated one of the
key differences between "hard" and "soft" power. "Soft" power cannot survive where it is not protected by
"hard" power. Moreover, there are few if any crises cases where advice and aid in politics, governance,
economics and rule of law can be separated from a matching need for advice and aid in addressing military,
security, counterterrorism, and national police concerns.
In short, we do not need "gotcha" post-mortems or half-formed defenses. The tribute we really owe
Ambassador Chris Stevens is to undertake the following eight steps:
• Understand that diplomacy will often be a form of asymmetric warfare in crisis countries, particularly
those with crumbling regimes or new unstable governments. Accept the fact there can be no success
without taking increased risk and suffering casualties.
• Set realistic and achievable goals country-by-country and give the ambassador and country team as
much discretion as possible. Don't set impossible goals for instant democracy, human rights, rule of law
or stability. Accept the need for evolutionary action and "doing it their way." Don't try one size fits all
ideological solutions or efforts from Washington.
• Stop focusing on narrow budget cuts and examine the costs and benefits of effective, well-funded
country team efforts. If properly funded diplomacy and country team efforts only win support for the
U.S. in one crisis country over the next decade, or avoid even one armed intervention, they will still
more than pay for their costs in terms of the U.S. budget, and the overall effort will be immensely more
valuable in terms of gains (and tax revenues) in U.S. trade and investment.
• Reexamine how to create all of the elements of "expeditionary diplomacy" efforts, including strong
country teams, and the ability to suddenly boost teams in countries in crises, with the full range of tools
an ambassador needs. This includes adequate staff, operating and security funds, and flexible aid funds
that can be applied quickly to deal with changing needs and circumstances.
• Fully fund security but find the best ways to change existing procedures to emphasize mobility and
move to high-risk areas. Refocus intelligence to help reduce risks, and restructure protection efforts to
provide specially trained and equipped U.S. and foreign national security. Stop doing pointless security
post-mortem blame games and focus on the future.
• Reward and encourage necessary risk taking. Make it clear that this is a key part of a successful career
path, that it will be fully supported by State and other agencies deploying U.S. personnel, and reorient
security efforts in country to protect such efforts in the best ways possible rather than creating rules that
either make effective action impossible or force diplomats and advisors to violate such rules without
protection. Anyone who works with U.S. diplomats, aid workers, and military advisory teams overseas

Reexamine the insurance coverage, benefits, and salaries of such risk takers. Don't sustain the present
situation in Afghanistan and earlier in Iraq where contractors get massive wage increases and diplomats
and aid workers lack the full equivalent of combat pay and protection for them and their families if they
are killed or disabled. Ensure adequate lasting medical care for lasting injuries.
Finally, see if there is some way the U.S. Congress can address these issues realistically in a way that actually
focuses on U.S. national interests even in a time of petty partisan feeding frenzies. These efforts not only need
the next Administration to fully fund and support them at a time of growing budget pressures, they need
bipartisan support in both Houses of Congress.
There will be a need for outside review, for new reporting requirement and for hearings. But, they need to look
forward. U.S. efforts must serve national interests rather than personal or partisan advantage, accept the
complexity and time needed to deal with country-by-country efforts, and focus on pragmatic ways of dealing
with the future rather than dissecting the past.

It is almost inevitable in an election year that Republicans use every possible opportunity to attack the Obama.
Administration. Part of these attacks have been effort to embarrass the President by turning the killing of
Ambassador Stevens into a "goteha" contest where the President is somehow blamed for largely local security
decisions and "intelligence failures." The Administration, in turn, has fumbled the situation by going into a state
of confused denial – focusing on the uncertain chronology of events that led to Ambassador Chris Stevens'
death.

The Republicans seem to be "winning" in political terms, largely because so few Americans in think tanks and
the media realize that virtually all intelligence and security post-mortems on such events uncover the same
problems. Once the event is over and clear patterns emerge, there are always warning indicators that could have
been heeded in retrospect. If one ignores that vast amount of "noise" from other conflicting indicators, and
looks back with 20-20 hindsight, every such event is always an "intelligence" failure.
Moreover, competent security officers always are asking for more support and coverage in any area where risks
exist. There is never enough security even in the best funded times, and these are not the best funded times.
Almost every aspect of U.S. diplomacy has been subject to budget cuts at a time of upheaval in the Arab world
and global economic crisis.
A recent article by Dana Milbank in the Washington Post notes that the same Republican dominated House that
now critiques events in Libya cut State Department operations by $300 million in 2009 and eliminated funds for
some 30 more security positions along with it. The House cut security funding by $128 million in FY2011 and
$33! million in FY2012, although the Senate restored $88 million. Under at least one of Congressman Ryan's
proposals to amend the budget, State Department funding would be cut by an additional 20% million in 2014 –
which means another $400 million cut in security.
It is no tribute to the Obama Administration that it did far too little to push back against these cuts, and even
less to articulate the need to fund stronger U.S. "expeditionary diplomacy" efforts. Indeed, at a time when far
too many countries are in crisis and the U.S. faces increased challenges to its regional goals, more funds,
stronger country teams, increased humanitarian aid, beefed-up military assistance, and on-the-scene diplomacy
is needed to support U.S. interests.
In fairness to Secretary Clinton and the large number of dedicated diplomatic professionals, State has tried to
deal with these challenges by refocusing its diminishing resources, strengthening its ability to provide on-the-
scene aid, and creating civil efforts that can deal with crises like Syria and the need to provide stronger U.S. aid
and advisory teams if dictators like Assad fall.
So far, both the Republican "gotcha" efforts and the Administration's failure to make the case for strong
"expeditionary diplomacy" have totally failed to serve the U.S. national interest, and have been the worst
possible memorial to Ambassador Chris Stevens, a man who clearly knew that America's success required risk
taking and action in the field.
It is time we come to grips with the world we actually live in. We can't deal with the political upheavals in a
single Arab country, the impact of Transition in Afghanistan, the internal struggle for the future of Islam,
energy and trade security, the various national crises in Latin America and Africa, or the competition for the
future of Asia by speeches in the U.S., quick visits by senior U.S. officials, outside radio and TV programs, and
empty rhetoric about taking stronger stands or exporting U.S. values.
We need strong country teams, and teams that are active and take risks. We need men and women on the scene
who accept the realities on the ground in the countries they operate in. We need strong country teams that can
work with the full range of factions, provide help in forming political parties and changing governance, provide
carefully selected aid and advisory efforts to catalyze reform, and provide military and security advisors that
can help countries move towards stability without excessive repression and threatening their neighbors.
We need to protect our embassies, consulates, and military advisory groups, but we cannot afford to turn them
in to fortresses that lock our diplomats, aid teams, and military on the scene away from events and the people
they are trying to influence. If there are any real lessons from Libya —or Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Yemen,
Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and all the other nations on the long list of cases where
American diplomats, advisors and security teams died to serve their country it is that projecting any form of

1.On October 15, 2012, new Libya Prime Minister All Zidan discussed the future structure of
his cabinet and administration with senior advisors to interim President Yussef el Magariaf.
According to a sensitive source, Zidan stated that he intends to draw on all sectors of the Libyan
political world to form his cabinet. He also advised that while be must proceed with caution he will
have at least one and possibly as many as three members of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) and its
Justice and Construction Party (JCP) included M the cabinet. Zidari believes that he can find
members of the JCP and other Islamist groups who support his plan for establishing a moderate
Islamic state, while maintaining good working relations with the United States and Western Europe.
Zidan also plans to reach out to the supporters of Islamist General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj, who
he believes can be used as a balance against al Qafda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and Ansar al
Sharia as they attempt to undermine the new administration,
2. In the opinion of this individual Zidan is committed to Magariafs policy of seeking

individual to serve as Minister of Oil who has the appropriate experience and reputation in the
International Oil industry, while maintaining Islamic credentials that will allow the Minister to work
with the JCP and conservative independent members of the General National Congress (GNC). Zidan
believes this will be among his greatest challenges. At the same time, this individual notes that Zidan

Brotherhood Government of Egypt to use Egyptian oil service firms to replace Western firms in
supporting the Libyan oil industry. Zidan is skeptical about this idea, fearing that Libya could become
too dependent on Egypt for technical expertise. He believes that Western firms provide the
opportunity to maintain independence and balance in the oil sector.
3.(Source Comment: In the opinion of this source, Zidan, who served at the Libyan Mission to
India for two years before defecting to the West in 1980, joining Magariaf and his anti- Qadd.afi
National Front for the Salvation of Libya (NFSL), plans to work with all of the parties and groups in
the GNC. At the same time his history gives the Prime Minister a relationship with the President and
a degree of credibility that will be helpful as he forms his cabinet. According to this source, Zidan
wants to move quickly to name a cabinet. His position is also strengthened by the fact that he worked
on behalf of the National Transitional Council (NTC) during the 2011Civil War, organizing
international support for the rebels. According to this sensitive source, Ziclan's immediate concerns
include organizing the investigation of the September ii attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi,
and the resulting assassination of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Zidan
is already under pressure from the U.S. Government to move the investigation along as quickly as
possible.)
4. In the opinion of this individual Zidan realizes that the attack on the U.S. consulate is now
an international symbol of the security issues at play in Libya, and that the use of pro-government
militias to provide security is not a long term solution to the problem. Zidan believes that the idea
that the government must ask for support from the powerful militias from Misrata and Zintan
undermines his efforts to bring order and centralized authority to the country. Zidan believes that he
can address this problem in part by developing a working majority in the GNC drawing on moderates
and independents, who will support his efforts to establish a modern Islamic regime that can work
with the West, particularly International Oil Companies. That said, he cautions his advisors that he
does not anticipate real success in this regard until the latter part of 2013.

Subject: FW: Benghazi update (1200 local)
Update from Rep. Stevens in Benghazi, based on largely on info from acting PM Ali Tarhouni and acting FM
Salah Bishari:
• TNC caretaker cabinet/members were up until 4am following events in Tripoli and discussing plans for
the coming days. Tarhouni said the TNC has been in constant communication with its people in Tripoli,
including both fighters and those entrusted with implementing the stabilization plans. Rebels in Tripoli,
in coordination with the TNC, have begun to set up checkpoints inside the city and guard public
buildings.
• TNC chairman Abd al Jalil and PM Jibril made statements to the media last nigh urging people to
refrain from revenge attacks and destruction of public buildings.
• There has so far been "no bloodbath" or serious looting.
• The capture of Saif al-Islam al-Qadhafi and Mohamed al-Qadhafi is significant. The TNC, including
Abd al-Jalil himself, intervened with rebels surrounding Mohamed's house to ensure that they did not
harm him. They understood that it would be harmful to the revolution and the TNC if he were
killed. These events were captured live by Al Jazeera in interviews with Mohamed. Both brothers are
in rebel custody (at this time, it is unclear to us exactly who is holding them, however).
• Per Tarhouni, the next steps are: 1) find Muammar Qadhafi; 2) issue a statement announcing the end of
the Qadhafi regime and the start of the interim period under the mic (TNC staff have begun drafting
this statement already); 3) insure the delivery of essential services and commodities (esp addressing the
acute shortages of fuel, children's milk, and medication for blood pressure and diabetes); and 4) move
the TNC to Tripoli.
• Regarding the move to Tripoli, Tarhouni said security arrangements would need to be made before they
could send the TNC leadership to the capital. We have heard from another contact that some TNC
members are already making plans to fly to Misurata and the Western Mountains, possibly as early as
today, and from there drive to Tripoli.

At Andrews Air Force Base on Friday, a military band played "Nearer, My God, to Thee." Marines in dress uniforms
carried to four black hearses the flag-draped caskets of the Americans, including Winchester native Glen Doherty, killed
at our consulate in Libya. President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton led the solemn ceremony, Clinton
speaking before him.
"If the last few days teach us anything, let it be this: that this work and the men and women who risk their lives to do it
are at the heart of what makes America great and good," said Clinton, her voice at times uneven with emotion for the
dead men she had employed.
Then she said: "So we will wipe away our tears, stiffen our spines, and face the future undaunted."
It was a perfect line for America and for Americans who try to keep peace in a smoldering Middle East. It was a line, too,
that captured — unwittingly or not — how Clinton has lived her life. How many times since this woman took center
stage in this country nearly 20 years ago has she, privately and publicly, wiped away her tears, stiffened her spine, and
faced the future undaunted.
Clinton appeared to be crying again as she listened to Obama, seeming stricken himself. And when Obama finished and
walked back behind the podium, Clinton reached for his hand like an older sister or even a mother, and held it for a
second or two. It was a moment the history books will remember.
There was the first black president on the verge of re-election, or not. There was the woman expected to be the first
female president, until he showed up out of nowhere. There was the rivalry and tortured history, Bill Clinton ever the
third actor in the shadows. But all of it was put aside for something bigger than politics or egos: their country. We don't
see enough of that anymore.
When her husband was president, I made a career out of trashing Hillary Clinton's hairdos, pantsuits, her attempted
health care coup, her right-wing conspiracy theories, her staying with that slippery serial philanderer. Four years ago in
the presidential primary I rooted for Obama over her.
Yet when she finally conceded a totally unexpected defeat, a different Hillary Clinton began to emerge. She surprised us
by accepting a consolation prize, secretary of state. She then went on to perform it so ably that nearly two-thirds of
Americans, an almost unprecedented percentage, approve of her and her rehabilitated — or so we hope — spouse.
More than once since 2008 I've wondered: Would she have done a better job than Obama? I don't know. But I do know I
sold this woman short.
In awful moments in history, some leaders rise to the occasion, and some don't. Think Ronald Reagan's reassurance
after the Challenger disaster. Or George Bush on the rubble of Ground Zero after 9/11, telling the world we'd never
forget. Friday, by comparison, was a tiny moment. Still, Hillary Clinton rose to meet it.

It is almost inevitable in an election year that Republicans use every possible opportunity to attack the Obama
Administration. Part of these attacks have been effort to embarrass the President by turning the killing of
Ambassador Stevens into a "gotcha" contest where. the President is somehow blamed for largely local security
decisions and "intelligence failures," The Administration, in turn, has fumbled the situation by going into a state
of confused denial -- focusing on the uncertain chronology of events that led to Ambassador Chris Stevens'
death.

The Republicans seem to be "winning" in political terms, largely because so few Americans in think tanks and
the media realize that virtually all intelligence and security post-mortems on such events uncover the same
problems. Once the event is over and clear patterns emerge, there are always warning indicators that could have
been heeded in retrospect. If one ignores that vast amount of "noise" from other conflicting indicators, and
looks back with 20-20 hindsight, every such event is always an "intelligence" failure.
Moreover, competent security officers always are asking for more support and coverage in any area where risks
exist. There is never enough security even in the best funded times, and these are not the best funded times.
Almost every aspect of U.S. diplomacy has been subject to budget cuts at a time of upheaval in the Arab world
and global economic crisis.
A recent article by Dana Milbank in the Washington Post notes that the same Republican dominated House that
now critiques events in Libya cut State Department operations by $300 million in 2009 and eliminated funds for
some 30 more security positions along with it. The House cut security funding by $128 million in FY2011 and
$331 million in FY2012, although the Senate restored $88 million. Under at least one of Congressman Ryan's
proposals to amend the budget, State Department funding would be cut by an additional 20% million in 2014 –
which means another $400 million cut in security.
It is no tribute to the Obama Administration that it did far too little to push back against these cuts, and even
less to articulate the need to fund stronger U.S. "expeditionary diplomacy" efforts. Indeed, at a time when far
too many countries are in crisis and the U.S. faces increased challenges to its regional goals, more funds,
stronger country teams, increased humanitarian aid, beefed-up military assistance, and on-the-scene diplomacy
is needed to support U.S. interests.
In fairness to Secretary Clinton and the large number of dedicated diplomatic professionals, State has tried to
deal with these challenges by refocusing its diminishing resources, strengthening its ability to provide on-the-
scene aid, and creating civil efforts that can deal with crises like Syria and the need to provide stronger U.S. aid
and advisory teams if dictators like Assad fall.
So far, both the Republican "gotcha" efforts and the Administration's failure to make the case for strong
"expeditionary diplomacy" have totally failed to serve the U.S. national interest, and have been the worst
possible memorial to Ambassador Chris Stevens, a man who clearly knew that America's success required risk
taking and action in the field.
It is time we come to grips with the world we actually live in. We can't deal with the political upheavals in a
single Arab country, the impact of Transition in Afghanistan, the internal struggle for the future of Islam,
energy and trade security, the various national crises in Latin America and Africa, or the competition for the
future of Asia by speeches in the U.S., quick visits by senior U.S. officials, outside radio and TV programs, and
empty rhetoric about taking stronger stands or exporting U.S. values.
We need strong country teams, and teams that are active and take risks. We need men and women on the scene
who accept the realities on the ground in the countries they operate in. We need strong country teams that can
work with the full range of factions, provide help in forming political parties and changing governance, provide
carefully selected aid and advisory efforts to catalyze reform, and provide military and security advisors that
can help countries move towards stability without excessive repression and threatening their neighbors.
We need to protect our embassies, consulates, and military advisory groups, but we cannot afford to turn them
in to fortresses that lock our diplomats, aid teams, and military on the scene away from events and the people
they are trying to influence. If there are any real lessons from Libya —or Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Yemen,
Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and all the other nations on the long list of cases where
American diplomats, advisors and security teams died to serve their country —it is that projecting any form of

smart power is done on the ground, is done by moving throughout the country, is done by taking risks, and will
inevitably incur casualties.
Some will be ambassadors, some will be aid team personnel or experts in public diplomacy, and some will be
CIA or men and women in uniform. Every one of them will be a tragedy. But we cannot let either false
economies or extremist and terrorist threats defeat such efforts. The cost of properly funded expeditionary
diplomacy —people, military and civil aid funds, and fully funded security efforts —is going to be cheaper
even on a global level than losing contact and U.S. influence in a single country like Egypt, or being unprepared
to deal with the flow of events in a nation like Syria or Iraq.
It is also already all too clear that extremist elements throughout the world realize that attacks on U.S. diplomats
and military advisors or partners are one of the cheapest and most effective ways to gain immediate visibility,
strike at the heart of U.S. public opinion, drive the U.S. out of a country, or limit its influence. No one needs to
defeat U.S. military forces — which can only be deployed to a handful of countries at most —if they can expel
or paralyze American diplomacy, support for U.S. businesses and investment, support for U.S. NG0s, and
effective U.S. military and security advisory efforts.
This threat is already all too real in far too many parts of the world, and it has effectively eliminated one of the
key differences between "hard" and "soft" power. "Soft" power cannot survive where it is not protected by
"hard" power. Moreover, there are few if any crises cases where advice and aid in politics, governance,
economics and rule of law can be separated from a matching need for advice and aid in addressing military,
security, counterterrorism, and national police concerns.
In short, we do not need "gotcha" post-mortems or half-formed defenses. The tribute we really owe
Ambassador Chris Stevens is to undertake the following eight steps:
• Understand that diplomacy will often be a form of asymmetric warfare in crisis countries, particularly
those with crumbling regimes or new unstable governments. Accept the fact there can be no success
without taking increased risk and suffering casualties.
• Set realistic and achievable goals country-by-country and give the ambassador and country team as
much discretion as possible. Don't set impossible goals for instant democracy, human rights, rule of law
or stability. Accept the need for evolutionary action and "doing it their way." Don't try one size fits all
ideological solutions or efforts from Washington.
• Stop focusing on narrow budget cuts and examine the costs and benefits of effective, well-funded
country team efforts. If properly funded diplomacy and country team efforts only win support for the
U.S. in one crisis country over the next decade, or avoid even one armed intervention, they will still
more than pay for their costs in terms of the U.S. budget, and the overall effort will be immensely more
valuable in terms of gains (and tax revenues) in U.S. trade and investment.
• Reexamine how to create all of the elements of "expeditionary diplomacy" efforts, including strong
country teams, and the ability to suddenly boost teams in countries in crises, with the full range of tools
an ambassador needs. This includes adequate staff, operating and security funds, and flexible aid funds
that can be applied quickly to deal with changing needs and circumstances.
• Fully fund security but find the best ways to change existing procedures to emphasize mobility and
move to high-risk areas. Refocus intelligence to help reduce risks, and restructure protection efforts to
provide specially trained and equipped U.S. and foreign national security. Stop doing pointless security
post-mortem blame games and focus on the future.
• Reward and encourage necessary risk taking. Make it clear that this is a key part of a successful career
path, that it will be fully supported by State and other agencies deploying U.S. personnel, and reorient
security efforts in country to protect such efforts in the best ways possible rather than creating rules that
either make effective action impossible or force diplomats and advisors to violate such rules without
protection. Anyone who works with U.S. diplomats, aid workers, and military advisory teams overseas

knows that we have strong cadres ready and willing to take such risks. The challenge is to properly
support them in county and reward them for their service.
• Reexamine the insurance coverage, benefits, and salaries of such risk takers. Don't sustain the present
situation in Afghanistan and earlier in Iraq where contractors get massive wage increases and diplomats
and aid workers lack the full equivalent of combat pay and protection for them and their families if they
are killed or disabled. Ensure adequate lasting medical care for lasting injuries.
Finally, see if there is some way the U.S. Congress can address these issues realistically in a way that actually
focuses on U.S. national interests even in a time of petty partisan feeding frenzies. These efforts not only need
the next Administration to fully fund and support them at a time of growing budget pressures, they need
bipartisan support in both Houses of Congress.
There will be a need for outside review, for new reporting requirement and for hearings. But, they need to look
forward. U.S. efforts must serve national interests rather than personal or partisan advantage, accept the
complexity and time needed to deal with country-by-country efforts, and focus on pragmatic ways of dealing
with the future rather than dissecting the past.

Here is Susan on this week. She wasn't asked about whether we had any Intel. But she did make clear our
view that this started spontaneously and then evolved. The only troubling sentence relates to the
investigation, specifically: "And we'll see when the investigation unfolds whether what was — what
transpired in Benghazi might have unfolded differently in different circumstances." But she got pushed
there.
Waiting on other transcripts.
For more on what happened and why, lees bring in the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Dr. Susan
Rice. Dr. Rice, thank you for joining us.
RICE: Good to be with you, Jake.
TAPPER: So, first of all, what is the latest you can tell us on who these attackers were at the embassy or at
the consulate in Benghazi? We're hearing that the Libyans have arrested people. They're saying that some
people involved were from outside the country, that there might have even been Al Qaida ties. What's the
latest information?
RICE: Well, Jake, first of all, ifs important to know that there's an FBI investigation that has begun and
will take some time to be completed. That will tell us with certainty what transpired.
But our current best assessment, based on the information that we have at present, is that, in fact, what
this began as, it was a spontaneous -- not a premeditated — response to what had transpired in Cairo.In
Cairo, as you know, a few hours earlier, there was a violent protest that was undertaken in reaction to this
very offensive video that was disseminated.

We believe that folks in Benghazi, a small number of people came to the embassy to -- or to the consulate,
rather, to replicate the sort of challenge that was posed in Cairo. And then as that unfolded, it seems to
have been hijacked, let us say, by some individual clusters of extremists who came with heavier weapons,
weapons that as you know in -- in the wake of the revolution in Libya are -- are quite common and
accessible. And it then evolved from there.
We'll wait to see exactly what the investigation finally confirms, but that's the best information we have at
present.
TAPPER: Why was there such a security breakdown? Why was there not better security at the compound
in Benghazi? Why were there not U.S. Marines at the embassy in Tripoli?
RICE: Well, first of all, we had a substantial security presence with our personnel...
TAPPER: Not substantial enough, though, right?
RICE: ... with our personnel and the consulate in Benghazi. Tragically, two of the four Americans who
were killed were there providing security. That was their function. And indeed, there were many other
colleagues who were doing the same with them.
It obviously didn't prove sufficient to the -- the nature of the attack and sufficient in that -- in that
moment. And that's why, obviously, we have reinforced our remaining presence in Tripoli and why the
president has very -- been very clear that in Libya and throughout the region we are going to call on the
governments, first of all, to assume their responsibilities to protect our facilities and our personnel, and
we're reinforcing our facilities and our -- our embassies where possible...
TAPPER: But why...
RICE: ... and where needed.
TAPPER: Why would we not have Marines at the embassy in Tripoli to begin with? It would seem like this
-- this is obviously an unstable country. This is a region where U.S. interests have been attacked in
previous months. Why were there not Marines there to begin with?
RICE: First of all, there are Marines in some places around the world. There are not Marines in every
facility. That depends on the circumstances. That depends on the requirements. Our presence in Tripoli,
as in Benghazi, is relatively new, as you will recall. We've been back post-revolution only for a matter of
months.
But I've visited there myself, both to Tripoli and Benghazi. I was very grateful to have a strong security
presence with me as part of our -- our embassy detachment there. So we certainly are aware that Libya is a
place where there have been increasingly some violent incidents. The security personnel that the State

Department thought were required were in place. And we'll see when the investigation unfolds whether
what was -- what transpired in Benghazi might have unfolded differently in different circumstances.
But the president has been very clear. The protection of American personnel and facilities is and will
remain our top ptiority. That's why we've reinforced our presence in Tripoli and elsewhere.
TAPPER: Look at this map, if you would. There have been protests around the world over the last several
days. And President Obama pledged to repair America's relationships with the Muslim world. Why does
the U.S. seem so impotent? And why is the U.S. even less popular today in some of these Muslim and Arab
countries than it was four years ago?
RICE: Jake, we're not impotent. We're not even less popular, to challenge that assessment. I don't know
on what basis you make that judgment. But let me -- let me point...
TAPPER: It just seems that the U.S. government is powerless as this — as this maelstrom erupts.
RICE: It's actually the opposite. First of all, let's be clear about what transpired here. What happened this
week in Cairo, in Benghazi, in many other parts of the region...
TAPPER: Tunisia, Khartoum...
RICE: ... was a result -- a direct result of a heinous and offensive video that was widely disseminated, that
the U.S. government had nothing to do with, which we have made clear is reprehensible and disgusting.
We have also been very clear in saying that there is no excuse for violence, there is -- that we have
condemned it in the strongest possible terms.
But let's look at what's happened. It's quite the opposite of being impotent. We have worked with the
governments in Egypt. President Obama picked up the phone and talked to President Morsi in Egypt. And
as soon as he did that, the security provided to our personnel in our embassies dramatically increased.
President Morsi...
TAPPER: It took two days for President Morsi to say anything about this.
RICE: President Mani has been out repeatedly and said that he condemns this violence. He's called off —
and his people have called off any further demonstrations and have made very clear that this has to stop,
(CROSSTALK)
RICE: Now, and -- and same, frankly, in Tunisia, in Yemen, and, of course, in Libya, where the
government has -- has gone out of its way to try to step up security and express deepest remorse for what
has happened. We are quite popular in Libya, as you might expect, having been a major partner in their
revolution. What transpired outside of our consulate in Benghazi was not an expression of deep-seated

anti-Americanism on the part of the Libyan people. Quite the contrary. The counter-demonstrations, the
outpouring of sympathy and support for Ambassador Stevens and for the United States, the government
of Libya and -- and the people on the street saying how pained they are by this, is much more a reflection
of the sentiment towards the United States than a small handful of heavily armed mobsters.
TAPPER: That certainly, according to polling, is the case in Libya. Not the case in Egypt. And since you
brought up President Morsi, let me try to get some clarification on something. President Obama was asked
about the relationship with Egypt on Wednesday, and this is what he said.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
OBAMA: I don't think that we would consider them an ally, but we don't consider them an enemy. They
are a new government that is trying to find its way.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
TAPPER: The United States has sent billions of dollars of U.S. taxpayer money to Egypt over the last few
decades. And by definition, as you know, according to the State Department, Egypt is a major non-NATO
ally of the United States. Why would President Obama say Egypt is not an ally?
RICE: Well, first of all, the president has been very clear and -- and everybody understands that Egypt is a
very critical partner of the United States, has long been so. That relationship remains the same, and the
president wasn't signaling any change in -- in the nature...
TAPPER: Was he trying to nudge Morsi?
RICE: The president wasn't signaling any change in the nature of our relationship. Obviously, the
president had a conversation with President Morsi and a very productive one, in which he underscored
that it's, of course, the responsibility of the Egyptian government as host to protect diplomatic personnel
and facilities, including our own, and we saw that President Morsi, immediately after that, took dramatic
steps to improve the security of our facilities in Cairo and elsewhere, and then went out and repeatedly
made a number of very important and powerful statements condemning the violence and conveying the
message that, however hateful such a video may be, there is absolutely no justification for violence against
the United States or other Western partners.
So what we've seen is that the president has been incredibly calm, incredibly steady, and incredibly
measured in his approach to this set of developments. And his interventions, his leadership has ensured
that in Egypt, in Yemen, in Tunisia, in Libya, and many other parts of the world, that leaders have come
out and made very plain that there's no excuse for this violence. We heard Prime Minister Erdogan of
Turkey say the same, we heard the Grand Mufti in Saudi Arabia say the same, that there's no excuse for
violence, that violence is to be condemned, and that governments have a responsibility to protect United
States personnel and facilities and those of all foreign diplomats.

TAPPER: I know you have to go, but very quickly, was the president in that interview trying to nudge
President Morsi, "Get your act together'?
RICE: No. I think that the president communicated directly with — with President Morsi and had the
opportunity to -- to understand our expectation that Egypt will do what it can to protect our facilities. So
that -- that was conveyed very directly, and the results were immediate and quite satisfactory.
TAPPER: Dr. Rice, thank you so much for coming here today and answering our questions.

Secretary Clinton's leadership on Libya
HRC has been a critical voice on Libya in administration deliberations, at NATO, and in contact group
meetings — as well as the public face of the U.S. effort in Libya. She was instrumental in securing the
authorization, building the coalition, and tightening the noose around Qadhafi and his regime.
February 25 — HRC announces the suspension of operations of the Libyan embassy in Washington.
February 26 — HRC directs efforts to evacuate all U.S. embassy personnel from Tripoli and orders the closing of
the embassy.
February 26 HRC made a series of calls to her counterparts to help secure passage of UNSC 1970, which
imposes sanctions on Gaddafi and his family and refers Qadhafi and his cronies to the ICC
February 28 — HRC travels to Geneva, Switzerland for consultations with European partners on Libya. She
gives a major address in which she says: "Colonel Qadhafi and those around him must be held accountable for
these acts, which violate international legal obligations and common decency. Through their actions, they have
lost the legitimacy to govern. And the people of Libya have made themselves clear: It is time for Qadhafi to go
— now, without further violence or delay." She also works to secure the suspension of Libya from membership
in the Human Rights Council.

March 14 - HRC travels to Paris for the G8 foreign minister's meeting. She meets with TNC representative
Jibril and consults with her colleagues on further UN Security Council action. She notes that a no-fly zone will
not be adequate.
March 14-16 - HRC participates in a series of high-level video- and teleconferences with
She is a leading voice for strong UNSC action and a NATO civilian B5
protection mission.
March 17- HRC secures Russian abstention and Portuguese and African support for UNSC 1973, ensuring that
it passes. 1973 authorizes a no-fly zone over Libya and "all necessary measures" - code for military action - to
protect civilians against Gaddafi's army.
March 24 - HRC engages with allies and secures the transition of command and control of the civilian
protection mission to NATO. She announces the transition in a statement.

operations. Over the course of several days, all three devote aircraft to the mission.
March 19 - HRC travels to Paris to meet with European and Arab leaders to prepare for military action to
protect civilians. That night, the first U.S. air strikes halt the advance of Gaddafi's forces on Benghazi and
target Libya's air defenses.
March 29 - HRC travels to London for a conference on Libya, where she is a driving force behind the creation
of a Contact Group comprising 20-plus countries to coordinate efforts to protect civilians and plan for a post-
Qadhafi Libya. She is instrumental in setting up a rotating chair system to ensure regional buy-in.
April 14 - HRC travels to Berlin for NATO meetings. She is the driving force behind NATO adopting a
communiqué that calls for Qadhafi's departure as a political objective, and lays out three clear military
objectives: end of attacks and threat of attacks on civilians; the removal of Qadhafi forces from cities they
forcibly entered; and the unfettered provision of humanitarian access.
May 5 - HRC travels to Rome for a Contact Group meeting. The Contact Group establishes a coordination
system and a temporary financial mechanism to funnel money to the TNC.
June 8 - HRC travels to Abu Dhabi for another Contact Group meeting and holds a series of intense discussions
with rebel leaders.

of Libya. She also secures recognition from the other members of the Contact Group.
Late June - HRC meets with House Democrats and Senate Republicans to persuade them not to de-fund the
Libya operation.
July 16 - HRC sends Feltrnan, Cretz, and Chollet to Tunis to meet with Qadhafi envoys "to deliver a clear and
firm message that the only way to move forward, is for Qadhafi to step down".

Re: Latest Libyan Leadership Private Discussions & Plans

highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. During mid-October 2012 Libyan President Yussef el Magariaf stated in private that he and
Prime Minister Ali Zidan have ordered National Libyan Aimy (NLA) Chief of Staff General Youssef al
Mangoush to establish a more coordinated operational relationship with Misrata and Zintan militias
in order to support expanded army operations throughout the country. According to a sensitive
source, prior to the death of the United States Ambassador on September 11, 2012 Mangoush resisted
greater reliance on these specific large militias believing that such a move undercuts the
government's efforts to disarm and demobilize all of the militias left over from the 2011civil war. At
this point, however, Mangoush agreed with Magariaf that the situation in the country is becoming
increasingly dangerous and unmanageable. Accordingly, the Chief of Staff stated that he will work
with Ousama al Jouwali, the leader of the Zintan forces to step up operations against the other
militias, (supported by the Misrata troops), that also come from the mountainous region of Western
Libya. At the same time he will instruct NLA troops under ground force commander General IChalifa
Belqasirn Haftar to pursue operations against tribal forces fighting on behalf of the Qaddafi family in

2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Magariaf and Zidan agree that Libya's
future depends on the success of their efforts in this militia demobilization operation over the next six
months. While they believe that the involvement of Ansar al Sharia forces, with the assistance of al
Qai'da in the Islamic Magreb (AQIM), in the assassination of the U.S. Ambassador has focused the
world business and diplomatic community on the reality of the security issues surrounding the
militias, the President and Prime Minister also fear that the situation is far worse than Western
sources realize. Mangoush informs them that AQIM and radical Sala.fist groups are increasing their
efforts to take advantage of the frustrations of the various militias with the government, using the
attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi as an inspiration for their activities. Just as Ansar at Sharia
began as a militia supporting the federalist claims of Eastern tribal leaders, and was then infiltrated
by AQIM radicals, Mangoush believes many of the other regional and ethnic militias around the
country could follow the same path, if his troops do not succeed in the disarmament program. He
also agrees with Zidan that they must move quickly since Libya's tradition of avoiding the Sunni-Shia
conflict that dominates most of Middle East is beginning to erode during this period of chaos.)
3. A particularly sensitive source noted that NLA operations have already begun against Ansar
at Sharia forces south of Benghazi, after members of that militia/terrorist group killed four national
policemen during a grenade attack at a roadblock in the Sousa Mountains. Under orders from Haftar
Libyan troops surrounded more than 100 Ansar al Sharia fighters in the region of the town of Sousa.
According to this sensitive source, the NLA. suffered relatively heavy casualties in the fighting, but
believe they captured a number of AQIM operatives and one of Ansar at Shaaia's senior commanders,
Sufian bin Qamu, who they believe ordered the attack on the police. Mangoush also reported to Zidan
that Qamu had been previously captured by United States forces and imprisoned at the Guantanamo
Bay facility.
4. At the same time the Libyan army and forces from the Misrata militia entered the town of
Bani Walid approximately mot miles south of Tripoli, in an area still loyal to the Qaddafi family,
engaging in close fighting with pro-Qadclafi forces. During the fighting Haftar dispatched troops with
heavier arms to support the Misrata forces. According to this source, the NTLA downplayed the level of
the fighting, in an effort to reassure the supporters of the Government. That said the NLA/Misrata
force had captured the city center and the airport after suffering significant casualties. The
Government forces entered the city after shelling opposition positions around the city hospital, using
heavy mortars and motorized guns.
5. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this knowledgeable individual, while Magariaf and
Zidan remain optimistic about the future of Libya, they believe that the security situation will remain
tenuous throughout 2013. Magariaf also sees the national election scheduled for mid-2013 as a
potentially complicating factor. According to this source, Mangoush and Haftar focused on Rani
Walid under pressure from the Misrata commanders. These militia leaders were, according to a
knowledgeable source, angered over the death of one of their senior officials, Omran Shaban, at the
hands of pro-Qaddafi forces in Bani Walid. The Misrata commanders report that Shaban was one of
the organizers of the Misrata militia unit that captured and executed Qadclafi in 2011 outside of the
town of Sirte. The Misrata leaders, supported by the General National Council (GNC), demanded the
surrender of the men who arrested and killed Shaban. As the fighting expanded through late
September and early October, Magariaf and his advisors came to see Bani Walid as an important
symbol of their commitment to disarm the militias and anti-government groups, and increased their
involvement accordingly.)

1. During mid-October 2012 Libyan President Yussef el Magariaf stated in private that he and
Piime Minister Ali Zidan have ordered National Libyan Army (NIA) Chief of Staff General Youssef al
Mangoush to establish a more coordinated operational relationship with Misrata and Zintan militias
in order to support expanded army operations throughout the country. According to a sensitive
source, prior to the death of the United States Ambassador on September 11, 2012 Mangoush resisted
greater reliance on these specific large militias, believing that such a move undercuts the
government's efforts to disarm and demobilize all of the militias left over from the 2011 civil war. At
this point, however, Mangoush agreed with Magariaf that the situation in the country is becoming
increasingly dangerous and unmanageable. Accordingly, the Chief of Staff stated that he will work
with Ousama al Jouwali, the leader of the Zintan forces to step up operations against the other
militias, (supported by the Misrata troops), that also come from the mountainous region of Western
Libya. At the same time he will instruct NLA troops under ground force commander General Khalifa
Belgasina Haftar to pursue operations against tribal forces fighting on behalf of the Qaddafi family in
Southern and Southeastern Libya.

2- (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Magariaf and Zidan agree that Libya's
future depends on the success of their efforts in this militia demobilization operation over the next six
months. While they believe that the involvement of Ansar al Sharia forces, with the assistance of al
Qafda in the Islamic Magreb (AQIM), in the assassination of the U.S. Ambassador has focused the
world business and diplomatic community on the reality of the security issues surrounding the
militias, the President and Prime Minister also fear that the situation is far worse than Western
sources realize. Mangoush informs them that AQIM and radical Salafist groups are increasing their
efforts to take advantage of the frustrations of the various militias with the government, using the
attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi as an inspiration for their activities. Just as Amax al Sharia
began as a militia supporting the federalist claims of Eastern tribal leaders, and was then infiltrated
by NEVI radicals, Mangoush believes many of the other regional and ethnic militias around the
country could follow the same path, if his troops do not succeed in the disarmament program. Be
also agrees with Zidan that they must move quickly since Libya's tradition of avoiding the Sunni-Shia
conflict that dominates most of Middle East is beginning to erode during this period of chaos.)
3. A particularly sensitive source noted that NLA operations have already begun against Ansar
al Sharia forces south of Benghazi, after members of that militia/terrorist group killed four national
policemen during a grenade attack at a roadblock in the Sousa Mountains. Under orders from Haftar
Libyan troops surrounded more than 100 Ansar al Sharia fighters in the region of the town of Sousa.
According to this sensitive source, the NIA suffered relatively heavy casualties in the fighting, but
believe they captured a number of AQIM operatives and one of Ansar al Sharia's senior commanders,
Sufian bin Qamu, who they believe ordered the attack on the police. Mangoush also reported to Zidan
that Qamu had been previously captured by United States forces and imprisoned at the Guantanamo
Bay facility.
4. At the same time the Libyan army and forces from the Misrata militia entered the town of
Bani Walid approximately 100 miles south of Tripoli, in an area still loyal to the Qaddafi family,
engaging in close fighting with pro-Qaddafi forces. During the fighting Haftar dispatched troops with
heavier arms to support the Misrata forces. According to this source, the NLA downplayed the level of
the fighting, in an effort to reassure the supporters of the Government. That said the NLA/Misrata
force had captured the city center and the airport after suffering significant casualties. The
Government forces entered the city after shelling opposition positions around the city hospital, using
heavy mortars and motorized guns.
5. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this knowledgeable individual, while Magariaf and
Zidan remain optimistic about the future of Libya, they believe that the security situation will remain
tenuous throughout 2013. Magariaf also sees the national election scheduled for mid-2013 as a
potentially complicating factor. According to this source, Mangoush and Haftar focused on Bani
Walid under pressure from the Misrata commanders. These militia leaders were, according to a
knowledgeable source, angered over the death of one of their senior officials, Omran Shaban, at the
hands of pro-Qaddafi forces in Bani Walid. The Misrata commanders report that Shahan was one of
the organizers of the Misrata militia unit that captured and executed Qaddafi in 2011 outside of the
town of Sirte. The Misrata leaders, supported by the General National Council (GNC), demanded the
surrender of the men who arrested and killed Shahan. As the fighting expanded through late

symbol of their commitment to disarm the militias and anti-government groups, and increased their
involvement accordingly.)

Jake I was so moved by Hillary's powerful presence today on the screen as I watched along with millions in America
and around the world. She was emphathetic and unflinching and inspiring; she was wise and steady and strong. My 80
year old mother called from LA to say "She was like our rock of Gibraltar". What greater compliment for the Secretary of
State on such an awful day? l salute her as well as you and your colleagues who crafted her remarks under tremendous
time and factual constraints. it really showed everyone the stuff of which she's made. With admiration and affection --

Re: Morsi's private conversations & coordination with Magariaf
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. Late in the day on September 14, 2012, Egyptian President Moharriad. Morsi told senior
European diplomats that he is increasingly concerned the current anti-U.S. and anti-Western violence
spreading through Cairo and into the rest of Egypt may be part of an effort by his Salafist political
rivals to destabilize his government, which many of them believe is too moderate in its positions
regarding Islam, Israel, and the non-Muslim world. According to this source, Morsi, who is in
Brussels for meetings with the European Union (EU), was particularly concerned over a message from
Army commander General Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, that Islamist guerrillas, believed to be drawn
primarily from the Sawarki Bedouin tribe, had launched an attack on a base of the International
Peacekeeping Force (IPF) in the Sinai. The General reported that the 1500 United Nations troops at
the base, including some U.S. forces, were under heavy attack and casualty figures were not yet
known. Morsi stated that this fight was an example of radical anti-government forces and Salafist
Islamist dissidents taking advantage of the current situation to carry out attacks that demonstrate his
government is unable to protect Western personnel and facilities in Egypt. Morsi stated that the
success or failure of his regime is directly tied to his ability to establish a moderate Islamic state that
can work with western business interests.

2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, the current wave of violence is related
to an ongoing struggle between Salafist and Sufi Muslims throughout Egypt. What makes it more
frustrating for Morsi is that much of the violence appears to be inspired by members of the Salafist al
Nour Party, the coalition partner of Morsi's Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) in the new Egyptian
Parliament. According to this individual, Morsi delayed condemning the initial attacks on the U.S.
Embassy out of concern that his opponents would use such a statement to move against his
government. Late on the evening of September 13, 2012, Mohammed Badie, the Supreme Guide of
the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood (MB), sent a message to Morsi warning that he and the Supreme
Guidance Council were concerned that the situation around the U.S. Embassy was getting out of
control and that, difficult as it might seem, he had to take tough measures against the demonstrators,
and protect the interests of the U.S. and other Western Governments. In a telephone discussion with
Saadi al-Katany, the MB/Freedom and Justice Party (MB/FJP) Speaker of the lower house of
parliament, Morsi admitted that he had felt constrained from acting, given his past history of poor
personal relations with the leaders of al Nour. Al-Katany urged him to gain control of the situation.)
3. On September 14, Morsi also stated to an EU official that he had received extremely forceful
messages from both the U.S. State Department and the Office of the U.S. President, leaving no doubt
in his mind that the U.S. —Egyptian relations and more than $ibillion in U.S. aid were at stake in this
matter. Morsi added that since much of this aid goes to the Egyptian Army, he and al-Katany agreed
that actions that put it in jeopardy would also damage the new Egyptian administration's current
good relationship with the Army. Accordingly, Morsi instructed the military and security forces to use
all necessary force short of lethal measures to protect U.S. and Western facilities. In a private
conversation, Morsi stated that he felt he is losing control of the political situation and fears that if the
current fighting results in deaths, either of demonstrators, U.S. diplomats, Egyptian security
personnel, or UN peacekeepers, the situation may spin out of control and his government could fall.
Al-Katany agreed, but said that taking no action would guarantee disaster. They agreed that when the
situation calms down they will have to deal with the al Nour party, which they fear will, in the future,
take advantage of circumstances to try to destabilize Morsi's administration. With this in mind, Morsi
ordered al-Sissi to direct the commanders of Military Intelligence (MI -Mukhabarat el-Khabeya) to
step up operations collecting information on the activities of the al Nour leadership, focusing on any
contacts with potentially violent Salafist dissidents.
4.(Source Comment: A separate sensitive source also noted that General al-Sissi is warning
Morsi about press reports that the person who made the controversial internet film at the heart of this
situation is an Egyptian Coptic Christian. The General cautioned that as this report gains wider
circulation, the government and the Army must prepare for violent attacks by Islamists against that
community, which makes up ten (10) percent of the Egyptian population.)
5. A separate sensitive source noted that for his part, al-Sissi is prepared to to have his troops
take harsh measures against any demonstrators who attack Western personnel and facilities. The
General is also concerned that the al Nour leaders are even more dangerous than Morsi realizes, and
he has ordered the MI to increase technical and physical surveillance of these individuals. In
addition, he stated in private that Morsi and al-Katany spoke with Libyan President Mohammed
Yussef el Magariaf, and they had all agreed that military and security officials in Egypt and Libya will
cooperate in an effort to track links between the violence in Cairo and Benghazi. Al-Sissi has ordered
Special Forces units to step up patrols in the Egypt-Libya border region, while the MI will monitor
communications between dissidents; primarily Salafists, in both countries. According to this source
the General is convinced that these dissidents are seizing the opportunity presented by the current
unrest to move against the governments of Morsi and al-Magariaf. He also received permission from
Morsi to step up cooperation with his counterparts in the U.S. and Western Europe to deal with this

situation and al-Sissi believes al-Magariaf has given similar instructions to Libyan military and
security officials.
6. (Source Comment: According to a separate sensitive source, al-Sissi believes that, given his
new orders from Morsi, the Army can, for the most part, protect Western facilities and personnel in
Egypt. But the General is concerned that the security services can never completely eliminate the
threat from small well organized bands looking to carry out terrorist attacks. Following discussion
with Libyan security officials he believes they have the same concerns.)

Re: Libyan leadership and militias
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. During the last week of December 2011, and the first week of 2012, Libya's Prime Minister
Abdurrahim el-Keib and President Mustafa Abdul Jail engaged in a series of emergency planning
meetings attempting to deal with specific issues threatening the stability of the new National
Transitional Council (NTC) Government. According to extremely sensitive sources speaking in strict
confidence, paramount among these issues are the questions of disarming and rewarding the regional
militias who bore the majority of the fighting against the regime of Muaimnar al Qaddafi, as well as
the related issue of finding ministers and senior administrators for the new government who are
acceptable to these revolutionary forces. These individuals noted that on four occasions, beginning on
December 23, 2011, groups or angry militiamen came to el-Keib's office and demanded better
treatment, a clear message of support for the role of Islamic law, and the removal of former Qaddafi
advisors from the new government.
2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib is genuinely concerned
that this situation could spiral out of control and threatens the regime. He also suspects that much of
the unrest is being stirred by General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj and his conservative Islamist
supporters. By staying out of the new government, Belhaj has established a position from which he
can criticize their actions and appointments without concern or control,. That said, el — Keib has been

told by his contacts in the Moslem Brotherhood (MB) that even Belhaj has been surprised that the
unrest in the militias has begun to manifest itself in fighting between groups that previously shared
the same goals and operated under Belhars loose command. This is particularly true in the case of
the increasingly violent conflicts between the Misrata and Zintan regional militias.)
3. In an effort to address these problems el-Keib is making changes in his new administration,
removing Minister of Economics Taher Sherkaz, who, as a former economic advisor to Qaddafi, was a
particular target of the militiamen. In the opinion of well informed individuals, el-Keib's closest and
most influential advisors are experts with economic backgrounds and experience dealing with
Western firms and governments. The most influential of this group are Minister of Oil Abdulrahman
Ben Yezza, Minister of Finance Hassan Ziglam, National Oil Company chief Nuni Berrusien, and Nge,b
Obeda from the Libyan Stock Exchange.
4. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib and Jail are also very
concerned over growing criticism that these technocrats are puppets of various Western governments
and firms. Belhaj and the militiamen appear intent on limiting the influence of these Western
entities, using them as a weapon to weaken the el-Keib regime. This trend is also affecting national
security, where, despite el-Keib's efforts to maintain a balance between the Islamists, regional
commanders, and the national army, a potentially dangerous conflict has arisen over the position of
Chief of Staff of the National Army. El-Kieb, according to this individual, believes that he must settle
this matter in short order to avoid provoking security concerns among foreign allies and businesses
contacts.)
5. According to a knowledgeable individual, in late December 2011e1-Kieb resisted efforts by
General Khalifa Belqasim Haftar to establish himself as the Chief of Staff of the National Army.
Haftar, who lived in the United States for many years and is believed by Belhaj and others to have a
relationship with the U.S. Government, is using his popularity among the officer corps of the regular
NTC army to support his claim to be Chief of Staff. This produced heated protests from militia
leaders and in late December 20liel-Keib named deputy Minister of Defense Colonel Yussef al-
Mangoush, to be Chief of Staff. In the opinion of one source, this is a problematic choice, since el-
Keit) is replacing the supposedly pro-American Haftar with al-Mangoush who commanded one of
Qaddafi's elite Special Forces units, even after the revolution began. This individual believes that el-
Keib's decision was driven by personal animosity toward Haftar, and the influence of Minister of
Defense Osama al-Juwali. The situation is far from resolved, as Haftar and his supporters,
particularly in the Benghazi garrison, continue to claim that the General is the true Chief of Staff. El-
Keib and al-Juwali are working to reconcile all of the elements in this conflict as quickly as possible,
before the supporters of the two claimants begin fighting. In the meantime, el-Keib has stated in
private that he fully expects Belhaj to attack al-Mangoush, but the Prime Minister believes that the
Colonel is the only officer strong enough to disarm the militias and avoid a civil war.
6. At the same time, a very sensitive source added that el-Keib and Jalil are attempting to
reconcile the fighting between Misrata and Zintan forces in Tripoli by naming Misrata leader Fawzi
Abd All as Minister of the Interior and al-Juwali, who was commander of the Zintan militia, as
Minister of Defense. To date, according to this individual, this effort has met with limited success, as
the fighting has continued and the militias are refusing to disarm until their demands regarding living
standards are met.
7, (Source Comment: One very sensitive source noted, that el-Keib is aware of the fact that he
is running out of time to stabilize the situation in Libya. He believes that if he does not disarm the
militias and meet their demands in the next six months there is a good chance of increased fighting
among rival groups that could lead to civil war. In any event, he realizes that the ongoing instability
will cause Western governments, firms, and banks, to hesitate before committing themselves to long
term relationships with Libya. El-Keil3 believes that Belhaj and his advisors have made the same
judgment, and are waiting to fill any vacuum created by this violence, by establishing a conservative
Islamic Republic.)

heated protests from militia leaders and in late December 2011el-Keib named deputy Minister of
Defense Colonel Yussef al-Mangoush, to be Chief of Staff. In the opinion of one source, this is
a problematic choice, since el-Keib is replacing the supposedly pro-American Haftar with al-
Mangoush who commanded one of Qaddafrs elite Special Forces units, even after the revolution
began. This individual believes that el-Keib's decision was driven by personal animosity toward
Haftar, and the influence of Minister of Defense Osama al-Juwali. The situation is far from
resolved, as Haftar and his supporters, particularly in the Benghazi garrison, continue to claim
that the General is the true Chief of Staff, El-Keib and al-Juwali are working to reconcile all of
the elements in this conflict as quickly as possible, before the supporters of the two claimants
begin fighting. In the meantime, el-Keib has stated in private that he fully expects Belhaj to
attack al-Mangoush, but the Prime Minister believes that the Colonel is the only officer strong
enough to disarm the militias and avoid a civil war.
6. At the same time, a very sensitive source added that el-Keib and Jalil are attempting to
reconcile the fighting between Misrata and Zintan forces in Tripoli by naming Misrata leader
Fawzi Abd Ali as Minister of the Interior and al-Juwali, who was commander of the Zintan
militia, as Minister of Defense. To date, according to this individual, this effort has met with
limited success, as the fighting has continued and the militias are refusing to disarm until their
demands regarding living standards are met
7. (Source Comment: One very sensitive source noted, that el-Keib is aware of the fact
that he is running out of time to stabilize the situation in Libya. He believes that if he does not
disarm the militias and meet their demands in the next six months there is a good chance of
increased fighting among rival groups that could lead to civil war. In any event, he realizes that
the ongoing instability will cause Western governments, firms, and banks, to hesitate before
committing themselves to long term relationships with Libya. El-Keib believes that Belhaj and
his advisors have made the same judgment, and are waiting to fill any vacuum created by this
violence, by establishing a conservative Islamic Republic.)

Re: Libyan leadership and militias
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. During the last week of December 2011, and the first week of 2012, Libya's Prime Minister
Abdurrahim el-Keib and President Mustafa Abdul Jalil engaged in a series of emergency planning
meetings attempting to deal with specific issues threatening the stability of the new National
Transitional Council (NTC) Government. According to extremely sensitive sources speaking in strict
confidence, paramount among these issues are the questions of disarming and rewarding the regional
militias who bore the majority of the fighting against the regime of Muammar al Qaddafi, as well as
the related issue of finding ministers and senior administrators for the new government who are
acceptable to these revolutionary forces. These individuals noted that on four occasions, beginning on
December 23, 2011, groups or angry militiamen came to el-Keib's office and demanded better
treatment, a clear message of support for the role of Islamic law, and the removal of former Qaddafi
advisors from the new government.
2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib is genuinely concerned
that this situation could spiral out of control and threatens the regime. He also suspects that much of
the unrest is being stirred by General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj and his conservative Islamist
supporters. By staying out of the new government, Belhaj has established a position from which he
can criticize their actions and appointments without concern or control. That said, el — Keib has been
told by his contacts in the Moslem Brotherhood (MB) that even Belhaj has been surprised that the

unrest in the militias has begun to manifest itself in fighting between groups that previously shared
the same goals and operated under Belhaj's loose command. This is particularly true in the case of
the increasingly violent conflicts between the Misrata and Zintan regional militias.)
3. In an effort to address these problems el-Keib is making changes in his new administration,
removing Minister of Economics Taher Sherkaz, who, as a former economic advisor to Qaddafi, was a
particular target of the militiamen. In the opinion of well informed individuals, el-Keib's closest and
most influential advisors are experts with economic backgrounds and experience dealing with
Western firms and governments. The most influential of this group are Minister of Oil Abdulrahman
Ben Yezza, Minister of Finance Hassan Ziglam, National Oil Company chief Nuni Berrusien, and Ngeb
Obeda from the Libyan Stock Exchange.
4. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib and Jalil are also very
concerned over growing criticism that these technocrats are puppets of various Western governments
and firms. Belhaj and the militiamen appear intent on limiting the influence of these Western
entities, using them as a weapon to weaken the el-Keib regime. This trend is also affecting national
security, where, despite el-Keib's efforts to maintain a balance between the Islamists, regional
commanders, and the national army, a potentially dangerous conflict has arisen over the position of
Chief of Staff of the National Army. El-Kieb, according to this individual, believes that he must settle
this matter in short order to avoid provoking security concerns among foreign allies and businesses
contacts.)
5. According to a knowledgeable individual, in late December 2011e1-Kieb resisted efforts by
General Khalifa Belqasim Haftar to establish himself as the Chief of Staff of the National Army.
Haftar, who lived in the United States for many years and is believed by Belhaj and others to have a
relationship with the U.S. Government, is using his popularity among the officer corps of the regular
NTC army to support his claim to be Chief of Staff. This produced heated protests from militia
leaders and in late December 2011e1-Keib named deputy Minister of Defense Colonel Yussef al-
Mangoush, to be Chief of Staff. In the opinion of one source, this is a problematic choice, since el-
Keib is replacing the supposedly pro-American Haftar with al-Mangoush who commanded one of
Qaddafi's elite Special Forces units, even after the revolution began. This individual believes that el-
Keib's decision was driven by personal animosity toward Haftar, and the influence of Minister of

particularly in the Benghazi garrison, continue to claim that the General is the true Chief of Staff. El-
Keib and al-Juwali are working to reconcile all of the elements in this conflict as quickly as possible,

private that he fully expects Belhaj to attack al-Mangoush, but the Prime Minister believes that the
Colonel is the only officer strong enough to disarm the militias and avoid a civil war.

Libyans march against Islamist militias in Benghazi
By Peter Graff and Suleiman Al-Khalidi
BENGHAZI, Libya l Fri Sep 21, 2012 2:23pm EDT
(Reuters) - Thousands of Libyans marched in Benghazi on Friday in support of democracy and against the
Islamist militias that Washington blames for an attack on the U.S. consulate last week that killed four
Americans including the ambassador.
The "Rescue Benghazi day" demonstration called for the government to disband armed groups that have refused
to give up their weapons since the NATO-backed revolution that toppled Muammar Gaddafi last year
Marchers headed for a main square where a much smaller counter demonstration of hundreds of supporters of
hardline Islamist group Ansar al-Sharia were waiting.
"Ifs obvious that this protest is against the militias. All of them should join the army or security forces as
individuals, not as groups," medical student Ahmed Sanallah, 27, said. "Without that there will be no prosperity
and no success for the new Libya."
The late afternoon demonstration had a cheerful atmosphere as families marched with small children on their
shoulders.
Fighter jets and helicopters roared overhead in a show of official support for the demonstration, which has been
enthusiastically promoted by the city's authorities.

"Those military battalions that want to impose their ideology on the people of Libya will be confronted," Saleh
Gaouda, a member of new ruling national congress, said.
"This city wants to go back to stability and participate in building the state."
In a sign of the cheerful atmosphere, one car had a giant cardboard model of Benghazi's landmark lighthouse
strapped to the roof. As the sun set and the crowd began to disperse, someone shot fireworks into the air.
"DEFEND BENGHAZI"
Although the main demands of the marchers did not mention the attack on the U.S. consulate, it seems to have
provided a strong impetus for the authorities to rally support behind the country's weak government.
U.S. ambassador Christopher Stevens was well liked in Libya, and many people who were angered by an anti-
Islamic film made in the United States consider the attack on the embassy to have been excessive. Some
placards in English, intended for international news cameras, read: "We demand justice for Stevens" and "Libya
lost a friend".
"I am out today to defend Benghazi. Killing the ambassador is a completely separate thing," 26-year-old Amjad
Mohammed Hassan, a network engineer, said. "I don't give a damn about the killing of the ambassador because
the Americans offended the Prophet. I am just here for Benghazi."
Benghazi, 1,000 km (600 miles) from Tripoli across largely empty desert, is controlled by various armed
groups, including some comprised of Islamists who openly proclaim their hostility to democratic government
and the West.
Some of these have been identified by local people as being among those who were at the consulate protest last
week. U.S. officials have described the violence as a "terrorist attack".
One group linked to the attack is Ansar al-Sharia, which has denied involvement in the violence.
Abu Al-Qaa, a demonstrator at the Ansar al-Sharia counter demonstration, said Stevens "was preparing for the
entry of American troops into Libya".
"The will of the Prophet was to expel infidels from Muslim lands so that Muslims prevail. Terrorizing your
enemy is one of Islam's tenets."
He said he had fought against American troops in Iraq where he was arrested and sent back to Gaddafi's Libya
and jailed for three years.
One banner at that demonstration read: "Day to rescue Benghazi or day to rescue America?"
In southern Libya, at least six people were killed and 12 injured in clashes between security forces and a local
group, a security official and a resident said on Friday.
Security forces were sent to the town of Brak, 700 km (400 miles) south of Tripoli, on Wednesday to stop a
group broadcasting songs about Gaddafi on the radio, the official said. The security forces, made up of former
rebel fighters, came under attack upon arrival.

David Petraeus told Congress Friday in closed hearings that the CIA believed from the start that the September
1 attacks on the U_S. consulate in Benghazi o,,ere by terrorists. That leaves one VIP xvho'S snil missing from
Congressional serAny: Hillary Clinton.
GOP Congressman Peter Kin!! said Mr. Petracits`s testimony differed from what the former CIA director told
Congress itnim2diately after the attacks. Mr. King also said Mr. Petraeus said that the CIA's orig.inal talking
poii t. on the attacks were cditt.d. The. 21t.,::'red version beealrie the basis '.or U.N., Ambassador Susan Rice's
misieading and now infamotis comm<iints hiamino the aitacks on a YouTube video. Both that discrepancy aild
the :Sate of the altered talking points need further digt:iing. especially if Ms. Rice is nominated to be the next
Secretary of State.
But Mr. Petraeus wasn't responsible for lax consulate security or the U.S, policy that led to the Libya debacle.
That's Mrs, Clinton's bailiwick. Last month in interviews from deepest Peru_ the Secretary of State said "1 take

responstbility" for Benghazi.

Except she hasn't. She was conveniently out of the country for this week's House Foreign Affairs hearing, and
Senate Foreign Relations Chairman John Kerry refuses to hold any hearings on Benghazi. His loyalty may get
him a cabinet job, while Carl Levin's Armed Services Committee also pretends nothing much happened in
Libya.
The targets of the attacks and its first victims were diplomats. Chris Stevens died of smoke inhalation in the
blaze, becoming the first American ambassador killed in the line of duty in over 30 years. A junior colleague
also died. These men were Mrs. Clinton's "responsibility." Several hours after the assault on the consulate,
members of the jihadist militia Ansar al-Shariah turned on the CIA compound about a mile away, killing two of
Mr. Petraeus's men.
In Congressional hearings last month, career State officials admitted that threat warnings from Benghazi were
overlooked and requests for better security turned down. They said Foggy Bottom misjudged the ability of a
weak Libyan state to protect them. It's not clear how high up the chain these concerns went, but over to you,
Mrs. Clinton.
For over a week after the attacks, the Administration blamed the YouTube video. Mrs. Clinton didn't push this
misleading narrative in public as enthusiastically as Ms. Rice. Still, she bought into it. The father of Tyrone
Woods, a CIA contractor who was killed in Benghazi, told media outlets last month that Mrs. Clinton tried to
comfOrt 'him by promising that the U.S.-based maker of the video would be "prosecuted and arrested"—though
terrorists killed his son.
Beyond the Benghazi attacks is the larger issue of the Administration's Libya policy, a failure that Mrs. Clinton
should also answer for. At the start of the Libya uprising, Washington hid behind the U.N. Security Council to
resist calls for intAentions Mrs. Clinton's department then made the mistake of agreeing to a U.N. arms
embargo on both the Gadhafi regime and the rebels. This blunder forced the rebels to look elsewhere for
weapons and .cash, particularly Gulf states like Qatar that favored Islamist militias.
As Gadhafi's threes were about to overrun Benghazi in March, the Arab League, Britain and France called for
military intervention. Only after the Security Council gave the green light--when Russia abstained—did NATO
launch air strikes, American cruise missiles and bombers led the way, but efs_ iiiseef, President Obarna pulled
the U.S. out of a leadership combat role.
The U.S. also waited until July to recognize the Benghazi rebel opposition as "the legitimate governing
authority," after Luxembourg and 25 other countries had already done so. The war lasted until October. much
longer than necessary.

American disengagement continued after Gadhafi fell. Though rich in oil, Libya's well-intentioned new leaders
needed advice and encouragement to build a functioning state. The most pressing need was to rein in the anti-
Gadhafi militias and stand up a national army. But the U.S. was reluctant to follow up with aid or know-how.
(See our December 24, 2011 editorial, 'MIA on the Shores of Tripoli.") Qatar and the United Arab Emirates
stepped in with money and weapons, again favoring Islamist groups.
The Libyan people nonetheless voted in elections this summer for secular, pro-Western leaders. Yet the
government has limited powers and lacks a proper army. The militias have stepped into the vacuum, while al
Qaeda-style training camps proliferate in the hills around Benghazi.
This abdication is the backdrop to what happened on September 11. The large CIA outpost in Benghazi was
supposed to monitor jihadists and work with State to round up thousands of mobile surface-to-air missiles in
Libya. Yet it turns out that it's hard to fight terrorists on the ground with drones from remote bases. Without a
functioning government or broader U.S. aid, a small Islamist militia was able to target foreign diplomats and
eventually lay siege to the U.S. compound. The CIA closed its entire Benghazi shop that very morning--an
abject retreat.
For weeks, the Administration has tried to shift blame for Benghazi to the "intelligence community." Mr.
Petraeus's fall makes him an easy scapew.oat, even as Mrs. Clinton takes a valedictory lap at State and sets her
sights on a 2016 Presidential run.
But U.S. Libya policy has been her handiwork, and with the exception of the fall of Gadhafi it is a notable
failure. Mrs. ClinA is also a main architect of U.S. policy in Syria. which continues to descend into disorder
that may engulf the region, She shouldn't get a free pass from Congress.

jeff thanks for reminding me. The Al-Keeb government is clearly facing many crises, the major one being the inability so
far to implement what appeared to be fairly detailed plans by Minister of Interior Fauzi and Minister of Defense Juwaili to
incorporate 25k thuwar each (total 75k) into the security forces, armed forces and into the private sector (jobs, training,
education). the main obstacles appear to be inability to implement plans by any of the GOL ministers so far and lack of
funds although we hope there will be a solution to that soon. Also, none of the militias appears willing to budge without
seeing some proof that others are also willing to do so.
I am not sure about HRC contact ascribing these problems mainly to Bel-Haj, whose star we believed had fallen over the
past several weeks. The Islamists are demanding their share of the political pie like everyone else-no more and no less. I
met with a Libyan contact yesterday who had just met with an Islamist-led militiaman from Zintan. The leader of this group
demanded that women's role be inscribed in the constitution as per Sharia'-if that did not happen this guy threatened to
take up arms again. Sarkis-the new but now deposed Economy Minister is an example of the power of the street and
different voices clamoring for different things. He was a technocrat whom we dealt with in the past but because of the
perception that he was "part of the old regime" he had to go even though al-Keeb regretted the decision since Sarkis was
an able technocrat. So, the bottom line is that the disarming and reintegration of the militias is not going as well as we
would have liked though the Minister of Interior told me on the margins of the PM discussion with DDCI Morrell today that
things on that score were going "well." One positive ray of light is that Tripoli Local Council reps told us today that they
had begun registering thuwar to determine which of the three possible categories they could stream into. Another
disturbing trned which may be happening is the emergence of organized crime perhaps fueled by old regime elements
including Snussi and al-Baghdadi. According to MOI sources have expressed real concern about an unholy
alliance of former Qadhafi loyalists, criminals who escaped from prison, and odd assortments of different thuwar. They are
apparently getting money, terrorizing the cities by night and engaging in human trafficking, drugs, gunrunning and alcohol
backed by old regime money. The motivation would be economic and political (creating chaos and undermining
stability). Our Legatt reps will meet with the e the Brits tomorrow to see if we can respond to MOI request for help in
training a team to deal with this possible new and troubling phenomenon. Not sure whether this crime phenomenon is
connected to the murder of my good friend Hugo deSamie, a french businessman who had been involved in deals with
the old regime and was back trying his hand with the new group.
It is not clear whether he will survive given the
intense pressure the PM is coming under from the eastern Obeidi tribes-they want one of theirs in the position as
compensation for the murder of Yusuf Obeidi.

So bottom line, there is ferment and things are not progressing as fast and as far as we would like. But let's not panic yet-
the PM is well-intentioned and the ministers are able people if they can get the means to implement their plans. Itold the
PM today that we could help in various areas and that we could be as discrete as need be in light of his formidable
political vulnerabilities. By the way, he may be planning to visit Washington and NY end of January-ealry February period.

Another friend of 1-111Cs offers the following assessment/report from a source. HRC interested in your views.
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels
of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1.During the last week of December 2011, and the first week of2012, Libya'sPrime Minister
Abdurrahim el-Keib and President Mustafa Abdul Jai engaged in a series of emergency planning meetings
attempting to deal with specific issues threatening the stability of the new National Transitional Council (NTC)
Government. According to extremely sensitive sources speaking in strict confidence, paramount among these
issues are the questions of disarming and rewarding the regional militias who bore the majority of the fighting
against the regime of Muammar al Qaddafi, as well as the related issue of finding ministers and senior
administrators for the new government who are acceptable to these revolutionary forces. These individuals
noted that on four occasions, beginning on December 23, 2011, groups or angry militiamen came to el-Keib's
office and demanded better treatment, a clear message of support for the role of Islamic law, and the removal
of former Qaddafi advisors from the new government.
2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib is genuinely concerned that this
situation could spiral out of control and threatens the regime. He also suspects that much of the unrest is being
stirred by General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj and his conservative Islamist supporters. By staying out of the
new government, Belhaj has established a position from which he can criticize their actions and appointments
without concern or control. That said, el — Keib has been told by his contacts in the Moslem Brotherhood (MB)
that even Belhaj has been surprised that the unrest in the militias has begun to manifest itself in fighting
between groups that previously shared the same goals and operated under Belhaj's loose command. This is
particularly true in the case of the increasingly violent conflicts between the Misrata and Zintan regional
militias.)
3. Inan effort to address these problems el-Keib is making changes in his new administration, removing
Minister of Economics Taher Sherkaz, who, as a former economic advisor to Qaddafi, was a particular target of
the militiamen. In the opinion of well informed individuals, el-Keib's closest and most influential advisors are
experts with economic backgrounds and experience dealing with Western firms and governments. The most
influential of this group are Minister of Oil Abdulrahman Ben Yezza, Minister of Finance Hassan Ziglam,
National Oil Company chief Nuni Berrusien, and Ngteb Obeda from the Libyan Stock Exchange.
4. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib and Jalil are also very concerned
over growing criticism that these technocrats are puppets of various Western governments and firms. Belhaj

and the militiamen appear intent on limiting the influence of these Western entities, using them as a weapon to
weaken the el-Keib regime. This trend is also affecting national security, where, despite el-Keila's efforts to
maintain a balance between the Islamists, regional commanders, and the national army, a potentially
dangerous conflict has arisen over the position of Chief of Staff of the National Army. El-Kieb, according to this
individual, believes that he must settle this matter in short order to avoid provoking security concerns among
foreign allies and businesses contacts.)
5. According to a knowledgeable individual, in late December aotiel-Kieb resisted efforts by General
Khalifa Belgasint Hefter to establish himself as the Chief of Staff of the National Army. Hefter, who lived in the
United States for manyyears and is believed by Belhaj and others to have a relationship with the U.S.
Government, is using his popularity among the officer corps of the regular NTC army to support his claim to be
Chief of Staff. This produced heated protests from militia leaders and in late December 2011e1-Keib named
deputy Minister of Defense Colonel Yussef al-Mangoush, to be Chief of Staff. In the opinion of one source, this
is a problematic choice, since el-Keib is replacing the supposedly pro-American Haftar with al-Mangoush who
commanded one of Qaddafi's elite Special Forces units, even after the revolution began. This individual
believes that el-Keib's decision was driven by personal animosity toward Haftar, and the influence of Minister
of Defense Osama alehiwali. The situation is far from resolved, as Haftar and his supporters, particularly in
the Benghazi garrison, continue to claim that the General is the true Chief of Staff. El-Keib and aleruwali are
working to reconcile all of the elements in this conflict as quickly as possible, before the supporters of the two
claimants begin fighting. In the meantime, el-Keib has stated in private that he fully expects Belhaj to attack
al-Mangoush, but the Prime Minister believes that the Colonel is the only officer strong enough to disarm the
militias and avoid a civil war.
6. At the same time, a very sensitive source added that el-Keila and Jalil are attempting to reconcile the
fighting between Misrata and Zintan forces in Tripoli by naming Misrata leader Fawzi Abd All as Minister of
the Interior and alsJuwali, who was commander of the Zintan militia„ as Minister of Defense. To date,
according to this individual, this effort has met with limited success, as the fighting has continued and the
militias are refusing to disarm until their demands regarding living standards are met.
7. (Source Comment: One very sensitive source noted, that el-Keib is aware of the fact that he is
running out of time to stabilize the situation in Libya. He believes that if he does not disarm the militias and
meet their demands in the next six months there is a good chance of increased fighting among rival groups that
could lead to civil war. In any event, he realizes that the ongoing instability will cause Western governments,
firms, and banks, to hesitate before committing themselves to long term relationships with Libya. El-Keib
believes that Belhaj and his advisors have made the same judgment, and are waiting to fill any vacuum created
by this violence, by establishing a conservative Islamic Republic.)

Re: Libya internal strife
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of
European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. On the evening of January 22, 2012, according to an official with access to the leadership of the National
Transitional Government (NTC), Libyan President Mustafa Abdul &rill spoke at length with Prime Minister Abdurrahim el-
Keib, stating in a heated exchange that el-Keib's government must take the steps necessary to address the complaints of
the demobilized fighters from the 2011revolution. Jai pointed out that the new government has been discussing this
situation since it was formed in October 2011, and matters have now reached a crisis point, with a group of more than
2,000 disgruntled veterans, supported by students, attacking the NTC offices in Benghazi on January 21, destroying
computer equipment and NTC files. These demonstrators, some of whom threw Molotov cocktails at the NTC
headquarters building, continue to demand better medical care, jobs, payment for their time in the revolutionary army, and
a commitment to transparency on the part of the el-Keib regime; particularly the appointment of cabinet members and
senior officials.
2. According to this source, when el-Keib replied, pointing out that demonstrators were camped outside of his
office in Tripoli. He added that the government had to proceed in a measured and professional manner, Jalil stated in
angry tones, that NTC staffers were beaten and could have been killed during the January 21 incident, pointing out that
this is how the rebellion against IVIuammar al Qaddair began in February 2011. Jalil also warned that Islamist leader
General Abdel Hakim Alamin Beittaj and his supporters, particularly militia commanders from Zintan, Misrata, and other
western regions, are anxiously waiting for the NTC government to collapse. Their goal, in the opinion of this individual, is
to eventually move in and establish a strict Islamic state. Jalii, added that his contacts in the Egyptian Muslim
Brotherhood had been in touch during the preceding week, warning that the threat from Belhaj is very real. El-Keib stated
that he must press Minister of Defense Osama al-Juwafi and Interior Minister Fawzi Abd Ali to be more efficient in
administering their positions. According to this individual, el-Keib fears that al-Juwali, who was a western commander
during the revolution, may be maintaining a secret relationship with Belhaj and his allies. In response, Jalil warned el-Keib

to avoid trying to use the regular military forces posted around Benghazi under General Khalifa Belqasim Halter in an
effort to restrain the former militia troops as such a step could lead to civil war.
3.(Source Comment: In the opinion of an extremely well placed individual, el-Keib is, in fact, increasingly
frustrated by the inefficiency in his regime and the inability of his ministers and administrators to arrange contracts with
foreign firms. He complains that his principal advisors, Minister of Oil Abdulrahrnan Ben Yezza and Minister of Finance
Hassan Ziglam, have been too timid in resolving the questions associated with contracts involving foreign firms, both old
and new. At present it appears that whenever one official raises a question regarding an agreement the entire matter is
put on hold and delayed. In the opinion of this source, el-Keib knows that without these agreements he cannot meet the
demands of the veterans and the students. El-Keib stated in confidence, that he may have made a serious mistake in
removing the former oil/finance minister All Tarhouni from the government. El-Keib also noted that Jalil is shaken by the
January 21 attack on NTC headquarters and is searching for ways to appease the demonstrators. Most recently he
asked Abdel Hafidh Ghoza, his principal deputy and NTC spokesman to step down. Ghoza, who comes from the
Benghazi area, was particularly unpopular with the western troops.)
4. Following the discussion with Jalil, el-Kieb ordered Ziglam and Ngeb Obeda, the head of the Stock Exchange,
to move with all possible speed to address the issue of the foreign contracts and arrange for new vendors to provide the
services demanded by the veterans and students. In this discussion he pointed out that if they cannot deal with this
situation they will not have to worry aboutthe national elections in 2012, Libya will be an Islamic Republic, with E3elhaj as
the ruler. El-Keib pointed out that foreign governments and large oil firms must be aware of this threat and that this will
frighten them into meeting the conditions for foreign contracts set out by the NTC.
5. (Source Comment: According to an extremely sensitive source, el-Keib spoke secretly with Hatter, stating that
he, and those troops loyal to him, should be prepared to move to protect the government in the event of increased
violence. This effort could include moving against Beltiaj and attacking militia forces before they can unite and organize.
El-Keib emphasized that this is for planning purposes only, and no action should be taken until el-Ket gives the order.
He emphasized that he will do everything possible to avoid civil war, but he is now concerned that Jalil will be unable to
deal with the level of hostility against the NTC, and cannot be counted on to take strong positions against Be'hal and his
supporters. In the opinion of this individual, el-Keib cannot back away from his commitment to technicians in senior
positions, but he will press them as hard as he can to have the government respond to the needs of the veterans and
students. El-Keib believes it is not too late to address these problems, but they must move quickly.)

offices in Benghazi on January 21, destroying computer equipment and NTC files. These
demonstrators, some of whom threw Molotov cocktails at the NTC headquarters building,
continue to demand better medical care, jobs, payment for their time in the revolutionary army,
and a commitment to transparency on the part of the el-Keib regime, particularly the
appointment of cabinet members and senior officials
2. According to this source, when el-Keib replied, pointing out that demonstrators were
camped outside of his office in Tripoli He added that the government had to proceed in a
measured and professional manner, Jafil stated in angry tones, that NTC staffers were beaten and
could have been killed during the January 21 incident, pointing out that this is how the rebellion
against Muammar al Qaddafi began in February 2011. JAI also warned that Islamist leader
General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj and his supporters, particularly militia commanders from
Zintan, Misrata, and other western regions, are anxiously waiting for the NTC government to
collapse. Their goal, in the opinion of this individual, is to eventually move in and establish a
strict Islamic state Jalil, added that his contacts in the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood had been
in touch during the preceding week, warning that the threat from Belhaj is very real El-Keib

stated that he must press Minister of Defense Osama al-Juwali and Interior Minister Fawzi Abd
Ali to be more efficient in administering their positions. According to this individual, el-Keib
fears that al-Juwali, who was a western commander during the revolution, may be maintaining a
secret relationship with Belhaj and his allies. In response, Jail warned el-Keib to avoid trying to
use the regular military forces posted around Benghazi under General Khalifa Belqasim Haftar in
an effort to restrain the former militia troops as such a step could lead to civil war.
3.(Source Comment: In the opinion of an extremely well placed individual, el-Keib is,
in fact, increasingly frustrated by the inefficiency in his regime and the inability of his ministers
and administrators to arrange contracts with foreign firms. He complains that his principal
advisors, Minister of Oil Abdulrahman Ben Yezza and Minister of Finance Hassan Ziglam, have
been too timid in resolving the questions associated with contracts involving foreign firms, both
old and new. At present it appears that whenever one official raises a question regarding an
agreement the entire matter is put on hold and delayed. In the opinion of this source, el-Keib
knows that without these agreements he cannot meet the demands of the veterans and the
students. El-Keib stated in confidence, that he may have made a serious mistake in removing the
former oil/finance minister Ali Tarhouni from the government. El-Keib also noted that Jalil is
shaken by the January 21 attack on NTC headquarters and is searching for ways to appease the
demonstrators. Most recently he asked Abdel — Hafidh Ghoza, his principal deputy and NTC
spokesman to step down. Ghoza, who comes from the Benghazi area, was particularly
unpopular with the western troops.)
4. Following the discussion with Jalil, el-Kieb ordered Ziglam and Ngeb Obeda, the head
of the Stock Exchange, to move with all possible speed to address the issue of the foreign
contracts and arrange for new vendors to provide the services demanded by the veterans and
students. In this discussion he pointed out that if they cannot deal with this situation they will
not have to worry about the national elections in 2012, Libya will be an Islamic Republic, with
Belhaj as the ruler. El-Keib pointed out that foreign governments and large oil firms must be
aware of this threat and that this will frighten them into meeting the conditions for foreign
contracts set out by the NTC.
5. (Source Comment: According to an extremely sensitive source, el-Keib spoke
secretly with Haftar, stating that he, and those troops loyal to him, should be prepared to move to
protect the government in the event of increased violence. This effort could include moving
against Belhaj and attacking militia forces before they can unite and organize. El-Keib
emphasized that this is for planning purposes only, and no action should be taken until el-Keib
gives the order. He emphasized that he will do everything possible to avoid civil war, but he is
now concerned that Jalil will be unable to deal with the level of hostility against the NTC, and
cannot be counted on to take strong positions against Belhaj and his supporters. In the opinion of
this individual, el-Keib cannot back away from his commitment to technicians in senior
positions, but he will press them as hard as he can to have the government respond to the needs

An interesting piece. The argument that worked on my conservative Obama-hating (Hillary-respecting) friends, which
Keller hints at in the "slack" he'll cut us, is that our denunciations of the video aren't an effort to debate the mob; they
are an effort to give ammo to the right side to win the battle that Keller himself identifies (between extremists seeking
to put "pressure" on weak transitional governments and the more mainstream majority that supports those
governments). And you could say it worked. Governments stepped up. Extremist groups in Tunisia are backpedalling.
Etc.
So we need to make this argument forcefully.

The Satanic Video
By BILL KELLER
THE alchemy of modern media works with amazing speed. Start with a cheesy anti-Muslim
video that resembles a bad trailer for a Sacha Baron Cohen comedy. It becomes YouTube
fuel for protest across the Islamic world and a pretext for killing American diplomats. That
angry spasm begets an inflammatory Newsweek cover, "MUSLIM RAGE," which in turn
inspires a Twitter hashtag that reduces the whole episode to .a running joke:
"There's no prayer room in this nightclub. #MuslimRage."
"You lose your nephew at the airport but you can't yell his name because it's JIHAD.
#MuslimRage."
From provocation to trauma to lampoon in a few short news cycles. It's over in a week,
forgotten in two. Now back to Snooki and Honey Boo Boo.
Except, of course, it's far from over. It moves temporarily off-screen, and then it is back: the
Pakistani retailer accused last week of "blasphemy" because he refused to close his shops

during a protest against the video; France locking down diplomatic outposts in about 20
countries because a Paris satirical newspaper has published new caricatures of the prophet.
It's not really over for Saimaa Rushdie, whose new memoir recounts a decade under a
clerical death sentence for the publication of his novel "The Satanic Verses." That fatwa, if
not precisely the starting point in our modem confrontation with Islamic extremism, was a
major landmark. The fatwa was dropped in 1998 and Rushdie is out of hiding, but he is still
careful. His book tour for "Joseph Anton" (entitled for the pseudonym he used in his
clandestine life) won't be taking him to Islamabad or Cairo.
Rushdie grew up in a secular Muslim family, the son of an Islam scholar. His relationship to
Islam was academic, then literary, before it became excruciatingly personal. His memoir is
not a handbook on how America should deal with the Muslim world. But he brings to that
subject a certain moral authority and the wisdom of an unusually motivated thinker. I invited
him to help me draw some lessons from the stormy Arab Summer.
The first and most important thing Rushdie will tell you is, it's not about religion. Not then,
not now.
When the founding zealot of revolutionary Iran, Ayatollah Khomeini, issued his Rushdie
death warrant in 1989, the imam was not defending the faith; he was trying to regenerate
enthusiasm for his regime, sapped by eight years of unsuccessful war with Iraq. Likewise,
Muslim clerics in London saw the fatwa against a British Indian novelist as an opportunity
to arouse British Muslims, who until that point were largely unstirred by sectarian politics.
"This case was a way for the mosque to assert a kind of primacy over the community," the
novelist said the other day. "I think something similar is going on now."
It's pretty clear that the protests against that inane video were not spontaneous. Antisecular
and anti-American zealots, beginning with a Cairo TV personality whose station is financed
by Saudi fundamentalists, seized on the video as a way to mobilize pressure on the start-up
governments in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya. The new governments•condemned the violence
and called in police to protect American diplomatic outposts, but not before a good bit of
nervous wobbling.
(One of the principal goals of the extremists, I was reminded by experts at Human Rights
First, who follow the region vigilantly, is to pressure these transitional governments to enact
and enforce strict laws against blasphemy. These laws can then be used to purge secularists
and moderates.)
Like the fanatics in the Middle East and North Africa, our homegrown hatemongers have an
interest in making this out to be a great clash of faiths. The Islamophobes — the fringe
demagogues behind the Koran-burning parties and that tawdry video, the more numerous

(mainly right-wing Republican) defenders against the imaginary encroachment of Islamic
law on our domestic freedom — are easily debunked. But this is the closest thing we have to
a socially acceptable form of bigotry. And their rants feed the anti-American opportunists.
Rushdie acknowledges that there are characteristics of Islamic culture that make it tinder for
the inciters; an emphasis on honor and shame, and in recent decades a paranoiac sense of the
world conspiring against them. We can argue who is more culpable — the hostile West, the
sponsors, the appeasers, the fanatics themselves — but Islam has been particularly
susceptible to the rise of identity politics, Rushdie says. "You define yourself by what
offends you. You define yourself by what outrages you."
But blaming Islamic culture dismisses the Muslim majorities who are not enraged, let alone
violent, and it leads to a kind of surrender; Oh, it's just the Muslims, nothing to be done. I
detect a whiff of this cultural fatalism in Mitt Romney's patronizing remarks about the
superiority of Israeli culture and the backwardness of Palestinian culture. That would explain
his assertion, on that other notorious video, that an accommodation with the Palestinians is
"almost unthinkable." That's a strangely defeatist line of thought for a man who professes to
be an optimist and a problem-solver.
Romney and Rushdie are a little more in tune when it comes to mollifying the tender
feelings of irate Muslims.
In his new book, Rushdie recounts being urged by the British authorities who were
protecting him to "lower the temperature" by issuing a statement that could be taken for an
apology. He does so. It fills him almost immediately with regret, and the attacks on him are
unabated. He "had taken the weak position and was therefore treated as a weakling," he
writes.
Of the current confrontation, he says, "I think it's very important that we hold our ground.
It's very important to say, 'We live like this.' "Rushdie made his post-fatwa life in America
in part because he reveres the freedoms, including the freedom, not so protected in other
Western democracies, to say hateful, racist, blasphemous things.
"Terrible ideas, reprehensible ideas, do not disappear if you ban them," he told me. "They go
underground. They acquire a kind of glamour of taboo. In the harsh light of day, they are out
there and, like vampires, they die in the sunlight."
And so he would have liked a more robust White House defense of the rights that made the
noxious video possible.
"It's not for the American government to regret what American citizens do. They should just
say, 'This is not our affair and the [violent] response is completely inappropriate."'

I would cut the diplomats a little more slack when they are trying to defuse an explosive
situation. But I agree that the administration pushed up against the line that separates
prudence from weakness. And the White House request that Google consider taking down
the anti-Muslim video, however gentle the nudge, was a mistake.
By far the bigger mistake, though, would be to write off the aftermath of the Arab Spring as
a lost cause.
It is fairly astounding to hear conservatives who were once eager to invade Iraq —
ostensibly to plant freedom in the region — now giving up so quickly. on fledgling
democracies that might actually be won over without 10 bloody years of occupation. Or
lamenting our abandonment of that great stabilizing autocrat Hosni Mubarak. Or insisting
that we bully and blackmail the new governments to conform to our expectations.
These transition governments present an opportunity. Fortifying the democratic elements in
the post-Arab Spring nation-building, without discrediting them as American stooges, is a
delicate business. The best argument we have is not our aid money, though that plays a part.
It is the choice between two futures, between building or failing to build a rule of law, an
infrastructure of rights, and an atmosphere of tolerance. One future looks something like
Turkey, prospering, essentially secular and influential. The other future looks a lot like
Pakistan, a land of fear and woe.
We can't shape the Islamic world to our specifications. But if we throw up our hands, if we
pull back, we now have a more vivid picture of what will fill the void.

Benghazi's Deep Throat fingers Islamist Leaders for
Attacks as State Dept Criticized on Consular Security
Posted on 12/19/2012 by Juan
The report saying that security was inadequate at the compound that the US had adopted as its ad hoc
consulate in Benghazi, Libya, dominates today's headlines. That conclusion is obvious. The
"consulate" was just a private residence taken over for this purpose by the US in the city. It was not
constructed to be a US government building in a potentially hostile city.
I met a person who worked there when I was in Benghazi in June, and she told me that it wasn't even
clear if the consulate would be retained after the first of this year. It was possibly temporary,
depending on Congressional funding. (The Tea Party House hasn't been good on meeting requests for
embassy security funds).
The more interesting question than why ad hoc arrangements should have been made for a consulate
during and after the Libyan revolution (the answer to which seems fairly obvious) is, who is
responsible for the string of assassinations and acts of violence in the city, of which the RPG attack on
the consulate on September 11 was only one? Benghazi, with a population of over one million in a
country of 6.5 million, is Libya's second largest city and was the epicenter of the revolution against the
government of Muammar Qaddafi in 2011.
On November 22, Benghazi police chief Farej Darssi was assassinated. In October a police colonel
barely avoided death— his car was wired to explode. A Libyan intelligence officer was killed in
September. A general was assassinated in August. Some of these figures had worked for Qaddafi but
had defected to the revolution. Qaddafi's security forces were responsible for the 1996 massacre of
hardline fundamentalists at Abu Salim prison, and for making others just disappear. Likely the same
shadowy cells that attacked the US consulate are behind the attacks on Benghazi police and army
officers.
There may have been a break in the case. Last Saturday, Benghazi security forces loyal to the elected
government in Tripoli, captured a man they suspected of being involved with the groups behind the
violence. And, he appears to have been willing to spill the beans. So let's call him the Libyan Deep
Throat.
Deep Throat is so knowledgeable about the conspiracies facing the city and so dangerous to those
hatching them that the latter immediately attempted to spring him from jail.

On Sunday morning, militants attacked the police facility next to the holding cell where the man is
being detained. A policeman at that station died in a hail of bullets from the attackers, and they called
for back-up. The police car that sped to the scene was ambushed and three policemen in it were killed.
Still, the police stood their ground and fought off the assault, and they kept their valuable suspect in
custody, with all his valuable testimony.
Shortly after midnight, on Monday morning, small explosives were set off at the Garyounis police
station in Benghazi, damaging a couple of automobiles but otherwise doing little damage. Then
explosives were set off at al-Uruba police station, which also took sniper fire, but neither resulted in
casualties.
The police became vigilant, and they apprehended a shady-looking man skulking around near the al-
Hadaeg police station, finding him to have two rocket propelled grenades in his possession, which he
was apparently intending to fire at the station.
In other words, the capture of Libyan Deep Throat has set off a gang war on the police, who are being
informed by bombings and shootings that they must let their infounant go or risk their
So what is Deep Throat saying? According to local journalist Mohamed Bujenah of the Libyan Herald,
a senior figure in the Benghazi police told him that the informant had fingered as many as 7
prominent Muslim fundamentalist leaders in connection with these attacks, of whom the police
named 6 explicitly:
1 Sayan Ben Quinu, from the notoriously radical town of Derna, and a former prisoner at
Guantanamo
2.Ahmad Bukatela, leader of the Mai& Militia
3.Muhammad al-Zahawi, head of the Ansar al-Sharia militia
4.Muhammad al-Gharabi, a leader of the Rafallah al-Sahafi Militia
5.Ismail Sallabi, another leader of Rafallah al-Sahati
6.Salim Nabous, head of the Zawiya Martyrs' Brigade
It is just a newspaper article. We don't kilow if the informant actually named these individuals or if he
did so to escape torture, in which case we can't trust what he said. But if the allegations are true, there
is collusion among several hardline militias in the city to create instability in hopes of taking it over.
The new, elected, prime minister Ali Zeidan, has started asserting himself militarily. He clod the
country's southern borders against instability in the Sahel. He may well have some risky house
cleaning to do in Benghazi.

Re: Libya internal strife
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of
European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. On the evening of January 22, 2012, according to an official with access to the leadership of the National
Transitional Government (NTC), Libyan President Mustafa Abdul Jalil spoke at length with Prime Minister Abdurrahim el-
Keib, stating in a heated exchange that el-Keib's government must take the steps necessary to address the complaints of
the demobilized fighters from the 2011revolution. Jalil pointed out that the new government has been discussing this
situation since it was formed in October 2011, and matters have now reached a crisis point, with a group of more than
2,000 disgruntled veterans, supported by students, attacking the NTC offices in Benghazi on January 21, destroying
computer equipment and NTC files. These demonstrators, some of whom threw Molotov cocktails at the NTC
headquarters building, continue to demand better medical care, jobs, payment for their time in the revolutionary army, and
a commitment to transparency on the part of the el-Keib regime; particularly the appointment of cabinet members and
senior officials.
2. According to this source, when el-Keib replied, pointing out that demonstrators were camped outside of his
office in Tripoli. He added that the government had to proceed in a measured and professional manner, Jalil stated in
angry tones, that NTC staffers were beaten and could have been killed during the January 21 incident, pointing out that
this is how the rebellion against Muammar al Qaddafi began in February 2011. Jalil also warned that Islamist leader
General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj and his supporters, particularly militia commanders from Zintan, Misrata, and other
western regions, are anxiously waiting for the NTC government to collapse. Their goal, in the opinion of this individual, is
to eventually move in and establish a strict Islamic state. Jalil, added that his contacts in the Egyptian Muslim
Brotherhood had been in touch during the preceding week, warning that the threat from Belhaj is very real. El-Keib stated
that he must press Minister of Defense Osama al-Juwali and Interior Minister Fawzi Abd All to be more efficient in
administering their positions. According to this individual, el-Keib fears that al-Juwali, who was a western commander
during the revolution, may be maintaining a secret relationship with Belhaj and his allies. In response, Jalil warned el-Keib

to avoid trying to use the regular military forces posted around Benghazi under General Khalila Belqasim Hefter in an
effort to restrain the former militia troops as such a step could lead to civil war.
3.(Source Comment: In the opinion of an extremely well placed individual, el-Keib is, in fact, increasingly
frustrated by the inefficiency in his regime and the inability of his ministers and administrators to arrange contracts with
foreign firms. He complains that his principal advisors, Minister of Oil Abdulrahman Ben Yezza and Minister of Finance
Hassan Ziglam, have been too timid in resolving the questions associated with contracts involving foreign firms, both old
and new. At present it appears that whenever one official raises a question regarding an agreement the entire matter is
put on hold and delayed. In the opinion of this source, el-Keib knows that without these agreements he cannot meet the
demands of the veterans and the students. El-Keib stated in confidence, that he may have made a serious mistake in
removing the former oil/finance minister Ali Tarhouni from the government. El-Keib also noted that Jalil is shaken by the
January 21 attack on NTC headquarters and is searching for ways to appease the demonstrators. Most recently he
asked Abdel Hafidh Ghoza, his principal deputy and NTC spokesman to step down. Ghoza, who comes from the
Benghazi area, was particularly unpopular with the western troops.)
4. Following the discussion with Jalil, el-Kieb ordered Ziglarn and Ngeb Obeda, the head of the Stock Exchange,
to move with all possible speed to address the issue of the foreign contracts and arrange for new vendors to provide the
services demanded by the veterans and students. In this discussion he pointed out that if they cannot deal with this
situation they will not have to worry about the national elections in 2012, Libya will be an Islamic Republic, with Bethej as
the ruler. El-Keib pointed out that foreign governments and large oil firms must be aware of this threat and that this will
frighten them into meeting the conditions for foreign contracts set out by the NTC.
5. (Source Comment: According to an extremely sensitive source, el-Keib spoke secretly with Haftar, stating that
he, and those troops loyal to him, should be prepared to move to protect the government in the event of increased
violence. This effort could include moving against Belhaj and attacking militia forces before they can unite and organize.
El-Keib emphasized that this is for planning purposes only, and no action should be taken until el-Keib gives the order.
He emphasized that he will do everything possible to avoid civil war, but he is now concerned that Jalii will be unable to
deal with the level of hostility against the NTC, and cannot be counted on to take strong positions against Belhaj and his
supporters. In the opinion of this individual, el-Keib cannot back away from his commitment to technicians in senior
positions, but he will press them as hard as he can to have the government respond to the needs of the veterans and
students. El-Keib believes it is not too late to address these problems, but they must move quickly.)

1. On February 19, 2012, Libyan President Mustafa Abdul Jalil and Prime
Minister Abdurrahim el-Keib instructed Minister of the Interior Minister Favvzi Abd All
and Minister of Defense Osama al Juwali to move as forcefully as possible to deal with
armed conflict between the various militias which carried the bulk of fighting during the
2onrevolution against former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. According to an
extremely sensitive source speaking in secret, el-Keib, acting in his role as the head of
government, told the two ministers that, if they could not stop the fighting and disarm
the militias he would be forced to find ministers who can cally out his orders. Ali and
Juwali each stated privately that, while they would follow orders, they have little hope of
succeeding in this matter until el-Keib and Jail gain credibility as the rulers of the
country. Ali added that, in his opinion, this situation will persist until a new

2. In the opinion of this individual, the Prime Minister is particularly concerned
by the situation in the Southern portion of the country, where the area defined by the
towns of Ghat, Sabha, and al Kufra, where fighting between rival tribal and regional
militias has been exacerbated by the activities of Qaddafi loyalists, and their allies,
Taureg tribal fighters. This individual added that el-Keib and Jalil agree that the
uncertain security situation in this area represents a threat to Libya's future stability.
They agreed that, at present, if faced with a concerted effort by either disaffected
militiamen or pro-Qaddafi forces government security forces and the new national army
would be unable to protect either Libyan citizens or Western businessmen and oil
industry workers in the region.
3.(Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, el-Keib believes that any
attack against oil field workers will frighten large Western firms and seriously damage
Libya's efforts to recover from the revolution. This individual added that al Juwali is
particularly upset with his deputy Minister and Chief of Staff of the Army, General
Yousef Mangoush, who he believes has been unable to work with national army ground
force commander General Khalifa Belgasim Haftar. A very sensitive source added that
the Benghazi based units of the army, under Haftar's direct command, are currently
deploying to the area southeast of al-Kufra, along the Sudanese border.)
4. In the opinion of a sensitive source, Haftar and al Juwali believe that the
Sudanese military is providing arms and supplies to the pro-Qaddafi forces, under direct
orders from Sudanese President Omar al Bashir. El-Keib complained to al-Juwali that
Haftar's forces passed through al-Kufra region during early and mid-February on their
way to the Sudanese border, however; they did nothing to disarm the local revolutionary
militias, or stop the fighting between competing tribal groups. In the opinion of this
individual, Rafter felt that the threat from the pro-Qaddafi forces was greater than that
posed by the regional and tribal fighting
5. At the same time, a source with excellent access to the leadership of the
National Transitional Council (NTC) stated in secret that fighting continues between
regional, tribal, and religious rivals throughout the Northern/Mediterranean portions of
the country. This same source added that the ongoing struggle between the Misrata and
Zintan militias for control of the area west of Tripoli is particularly violent and
disruptive for the rest of the country. In the capital itself, fighting continues between
regional groups, the national army, Islamist militias, and criminal street gangs, all of
whom are very well armed. This individual reports that during mid -February 2012 el-
Keib and Jalil agreed to address the problem of disaffected former militiamen and their
families by providing payments of 2,000 Dinars (approximately $1,500) per month to
the families of fighters who were wounded or killed in the revolution.
6. In addition the President and Prime Minister instructed Minister of Finance
Hassan Ziglam to develop an efficient system to provide assistance funds to unemployed
former fighters. For his part, Ziglam privately expressed concern that previous efforts in
this regard have met with a high level of fraud. According to the government's best
estimates, the revolutionary army included approximately 25,000 combat troops, but it
is difficult to identify those with legitimate claims, as no accurate service records were
maintained. That said, he stated in private that the government must be seen to take
some form of direct action, even if money is paid to fraudulent claimants. The fact is,
according to Ziglam, the NTC is losing control of the country and must give something
to the veterans of the revolution to slow this process.
7.(Source Comment: Speaking in strictest confidence, a knowledgeable
individual stated that al-Juwali is concerned by the possibility that the country may
deteriorate into a multi-sided civil war involving the regional militias, Islamist forces
and the national army. At the same time, he acknowledges that the new army has lost
control of large portions of the southern part of the country, with tribal fighting spilling

slow pace of military and police training promised to the various Libyan national
security forces by the governments of France and Turkey. He added that, while Turkey
has received some of the most seriously wound troops for treatment, the lack of
adequate medical care for veterans inside of Libya remains a major source of conflict
between the former rebel troops and the NTC government.)

represents a threat to Libya's future stability. They agreed that, at present, if faced with a
concerted effort by either disaffected militiamen or pro-Qaddafi forces government security

forces and the new national army would be unable to protect either Libyan citizens or Western
businessmen and oil industry workers in the region.
3.(Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, el-Keib believes that any attack
against oil field workers will frighten large Western firms and seriously damage Libya's efforts
to recover from the revolution. This individual added that al Juwali is particularly upset with his
deputy Minister and Chief of Staff of the Army, General Yousef Mangoush, who he believes has
been unable to work with national army ground force commander General Khalifa, Belgasim
Halter. A very sensitive source added that the Benghazi based units of the army, under Haftar's
direct command, are currently deploying to the area southeast of al-Kufra, along the Sudanese
border.)
4. In the opinion of a sensitive source, Haftar and al Juwali believe that the Sudanese
military is providing arms and supplies to the pro-Qacklafl forces, under direct orders from
Sudanese President Ornar al Bashir. El-Keib complained to al-Juwali that Haftar's forces passed
through al-Kufra region during early and mid-February on their way to the Sudanese border,
however; they did nothing to disarm the local revolutionary militias, or stop the fighting between
competing tribal groups. In the opinion of this individual, Ha.fter felt that the threat from the pro-
Qaddafi forces was greater than that posed by the regional and tribal fighting.
5. At the same time a source with excellent access to the leadership of the National
Transitional Council (NTC) stated in secret that fighting continues between regional, tribal, and
religious rivals throughout the Northern/Mediterranean portions of the country. This same
source added that the ongoing struggle between the Misrata and Zintan militias for control of the
area west of Tripoli is particularly violent and disruptive for the rest of the country. In the
capital itself, fighting continues between regional groups, the national army, Islamist militias,
and criminal street gangs, all of whom are very well armed. This individual reports that during
mid-February 2012 el-Keib and hill agreed to address the problem of disaffected former
militiamen and their families by providing payments of 2,000 Dinars (approximately $1,500) per
month to the families of fighters who were wounded or killed in the revolution.
6. In addition the President and Prime Minister instructed Minister of Finance Hassan
ZigIarn to develop an efficient system to provide assistance funds to unemployed former fighters
For his part, Ziglarn privately expressed concern that previous efforts in this regard have met
with a high level of fraud. According to the government's best estimates, the revolutionary army
included approximately 25,000 combat troops, but it is difficult to identify those with legitimate
claims, as no accurate service records were maintained. That said he stated in private that the
government must be seen to take some form of direct action, even if money is paid to fraudulent
claimants. The fact is, according to Ziglam, the NTC is losing control of the country and must
give something to the veterans of the revolution to slow this process.

7. (Source Comment: Speaking in strictest confidence, a knowledgeable individual stated
that al-Juwali is concerned by the possibility that the country may deteriorate into a multi-sided
civil war involving the regional militias, Islamist forces and the national army. At the same time,
he acknowledges that the new army has lost control of large portions of the southern part of the
country, with tribal fighting spilling over into Mali and Chad. According to this source, al-
Juwali is also frustrated by the slow pace of military and police training promised to the various
Libyan national security forces by the governments of France and Turkey. He added that, while
Turkey has received some of the most seriously wound troops for treatment, the lack of adequate
medical care for veterans inside of Libya remains a major source of conflict between the former
rebel troops and the NTC government.)

a. During early December 2012 Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zidan and President Mohamed
Magariaf concluded a series of discreet meetings with selected tribal leaders from Eastern Cyrenaica
region (Barqa in Arabic), after which they agreed that the problem of the growing Barqa federalist
movement is gaining strength and will again become a major issue in early 2013. At the same time
National Libyan Army (NLA) Chief of Staff General Youssef al Mangoush warned Zidan that the
Eastern tribes have rearmed and reequipped in the past three months and are preparing to reassert
their desire for a degree of autonomy in early 2013. Mangoush also advised that the situation in the
region between Benghazi and the Egyptian border may become increasingly complicated as Salafist
fighters from Egypt continue to arrive in Benghazi. Mangoush reported that his staff officers have
been advised M secret by aids to Egyptian Army Chief of Staff, General Mohammed al-Sissi, that,
acting under instructions from Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi, military and security forces are
taking steps to detain or neutralize extreme Salafist para-military groups and that a number of these
fighters are fleeing to Libya. According to the Libyan commander, these Salafist fighters are
comfortable in Benghazi, where many of them served with Libyan revolutionary forces during the
rebellion against former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi.

2. In the opinion of this individual, Zidan and Magariaf, after consulting with Minister of Oil
Abdulbari al-Arusi, decided to move forward with a plan dating back to the administration of former
Oil Minister Abdulrahman Ben Yezza dividing the National Oil Corporatioes (NOC) production and
exploration divisions into two separate firms. With this in mind, al-Arusi began discussing the matter
with concerned parties in late November and early December. Included in these discussions were
meetings with members of the local federalist council in Benghazi and tribal officials from Barqa. In
these sessions Al-Arusi described a new structure managing all existing oil-related firms„ while
building new operations and raising funds from investors outside of the country. This firm will be
divided into two branches, one in Benghazi and one in Tripoli. Al-Arusi added that the cost of this
project will range between fifty (50) and sixty (6o) billion dinars.
3.(Source Comment: According to a separate sensitive source, this concept came as a surprise
to most of the local officials in Tripoli and Benghazi. This individual added that while the Western
officials continue to have some questions about the matter, the Benghazi/Barqa leaders were, in al-
Arusi's opinion, positive, if not enthusiastic about the new initiative. According to al-Arusi, doubts on
either side relate to the mistrust that remains between the two regions, but he is determined to move
ahead in this matter and is supported by Zidan and Magariaf. According to this source, the president
and prime minister are convinced that they must deal with this internal East-West issue before they
can bring a stable security environment to the country, and disarm the remaining independent
militias in each part of the country. This individual added that in private discussions al-Arusi stated
that the tentative name for this new oil entity will be the National Corporation for Oil Refining and
Petrochemicals Industry, with its headquarters in Tripoli, and substantive offices in Benghazi. Like
the NOC, the new firm will fall under the Ministry of Oil and Gas.)
4. In addition, this sensitive source noted that Al-Arusi is also discussing the creation of a
company specializing in mechanical construction related to the oil and gas industry. This firm would
be based in Benghazi. The minister stated in private that he believes such a company can be
developed to compete with international firms in this very complex field. He also believes that such a
firm must be managed by experienced, scientifically-qualified Libyans, with reputations for honesty.
He noted that until as such a cadre is developed it may be desirable to use experts from Egypt to fill
the immediate needs of the firm. Al-Arusi believes this firm should have offices in all of the oil fields
and loading facilities. The minister also plans to establish an office in Benghazi, similar to Tripoli's oil
institute, a facility that will train students looking to pursue oil-related studies. In addition, al-Arusi is
making plans to reopen the Higher Petroleum Institute in Tobruk, which was closed by Qaddafi at the
beginning of the revolution. He told a sensitive source that he expects the Tobruk institute to produce
thousands of skilled engineers to provide Libyan managers for the future operation of the oil sector.
Once the final details are set the Zidan regime will submit the entire package for parliamentary
approval and financing
6. (Source Comment: Advisors to Magariaf state in confidence that, in their opinion this
comprehensive plan for the oil industry will face opposition from individuals with links to foreign oil
firms, primarily foreign trained engineers who hope to see greater privatization in the oil an oil
services industries in the wake of the revolution. According to a particularly sensitive source, Zidan is
particularly concerned about this possibility, noting that these individuals see this issue in strictly
business terms, not considering the political issues, and the East — West situation, that are all part of
the overall picture in Libya. At present al-Arusi believes that foreign oil firms remain concerned
about the unsettled security situation throughout Libya, however; he is convinced that this new plan
will help address this situation. At present, he noted that the large Italian oil firm ENT is stepping up
its operations throughout Libya, and, with the support of the Italian Government, will continue to
increase its investment in Libya in an effort to get ahead of the other foreign firms concerned in
Libya.)

Subject RE: From HRC friend
I am skeptical that Jalii and al-keeb are capable either by power or by character to deal with the shortcomings of their
MinDef and Minint in this way. The latter 2 are both very powerful by virtue of their Zintan and Misrata roots
respectively, and any effort to remove them would have seriousblowback. MiniNt Fawzi who I saw the other day is
dearly way ahead of his colleague in getting the thuwar into the process of registration, the first step hopefully toward
DDR. I think everybody here is aware now how difficult the disarming of these militias, which have become de facto real
institutions in and of themselves. It is naieve to think they can be dissolved by executive fiat. Some positive movement
Jordanians preparing to accept first tranche of 1500 for police training.
There is concern here that continuing rivalries among the militias remains dangerous from the perspective of the havoc
they can wreak with their firepower and their continued control of select turf. At the end of the day, I think everybody is
coming to the conclusion that the elections will take place in the context of militia control. We hope that a program can
be devised to keep them acting responsibly toward the outcome of the election, especially viz the obligations they may
well be asked to undertake to keep elections free, and fair and devoid of violence. Always danger of continuing
skirmishes but Armageddon predictions a bit overstated.
We are all worried about the situation in Kufra and the clashes between the Arab alZwai tribe and the African tribals the
Tebu. This is again a legacy of the Qadhafi era who played on these divisions to keep himself in control. The
government believes that the Tebu are being aided from al_Qadhafi elements and perhaps government supporters in
Sudan to undermine the TNC. There are some disturbing signs that in fact the INC may be supporting the dispatch of
select militias to deploy down there maybe rpt maybe to "resolve" this ethnic problem as the situation in Tewarga was
resolved e, "ethnic cleansing" —We are only at the very beginning stages of seeing whether there is credible evidence
on this score—so please rpt please don't raise any flags about it It would be explosive] will keep you informed about any
info we develop.
No surprise about Heftar-he is extremely angry he lost out on the COS spot so his efforts to undermine the new COS

The war wounded is a national tragedy. The former group allowed everybody to go abroad and they did to the tune of
800 million dollars. 50,000 Libyans abroad now-15 percent receiving medical treatment. Who do you think the others

Here is the latest on Libya. As always, let me know your thoughts.
SOURCE:
Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of European
Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1.
On February 19, 2012, Libyan President Mustafa Abdul JAI and Prime Minister Abdurrahim el-Keib instructed Minister
of the Interior Minister Fawzi Abd All and Minister of Defense °same al Juwali to move as forcefully as possible to deal
with armed conflict between the various militias which carried the bulk of fighting during the 2011revolution against
former dictator Muammar at Qaddafi.
According to an extremely sensitive source speaking in secret, el-Keib, acting in his role as the head of government, told
the two ministers that, if they could not stop the fighting and disarm the militias he would be forced to find ministers
who can carry out his orders.
All and Aiwa each stated privately that, while they would follow orders, they have little hope of succeeding in this
matter until el-Keib and ialil gain credibility as the rulers of the country.
All added that, in his opinion, this situation will persist until a new government is chosen during the national elections
planned for later in 2012.
2.
In the opinion of this individual, the Prime Minister is particularly concerned by the situation in the Southern portion of
the country, where the area defined by the towns of Ghat, Sabha, and al Kufra, where fighting between rival tribal and
regional militias has been exacerbated by the activities of
Qaddafi loyalists, and their allies, Taureg tribal fighters.
This individual added that el-Keib and Jalil agree that the uncertain security situation in this area represents a threat to
Libya's future stability.
They agreed that, at present, if faced with a concerted effort by either disaffected militiamen or pro-Qaddafi forces
government security forces and the new national army would be unable to protect either Libyan citizens or Western
businessmen and oil industry workers in the region.
3.(Source Comment:
In the opinion of this individual, el-Keib believes that any attack against oil field workers will frighten large Western
firms and seriously damage Libya's efforts to recover from the revolution.
This individual added that al Juwali is particularly upset with his deputy Minister and Chief of Staff of the Army, General
Yousef Mangoush, who he believes has been unable to work with national army ground force commander General
Khalifa Belqasim Hefter.
A very sensitive source added that the Benghazi based units of the army, under Haftar's direct command, are currently
deploying to the area southeast of al-Kufra, along the Sudanese border.)
4.
In the opinion of a sensitive source, Haftar and at Juwali believe that the Sudanese military is providing arms and
supplies to the pro-Qaddafi forces, under direct orders from Sudanese President Omar al I3ashir.

El-Keib complained to aleitiwali that Hefter's forces passed through al-Kufra region during early and mid-February on
their way to the Sudanese border, however; they did nothing to disarm the local revolutionary militias, or stop the
fighting between competing tribal groups.
In the opinion of this individual, Hefter felt that the threat from the pro-Qaddafi forces was greater than that posed by
the regional and tribal fighting.
5.
At the same time, a source with excellent access to the leadership of the National Transitional Council (NTC) stated in
secret that fighting continues between regional, tribal, and religious rivals throughout the Northern/Mediterranean
portions of the country.
This same source added that the ongoing struggle between the Misrata and Zintan militias for control of the area west
of Tripoli is particularly violent and disruptive for the rest of the country.
in the capital itself, fighting continues between regional groups, the national army, Islamist militias, and criminal street
gangs, all of whom are very well armed.
This individual reports that during mid-February 2012 el-Keib and ialil agreed to address the problem of disaffected
former militiamen and their families by providing payments of 2,000 Dinars (approximately $1,500) per month to the
families of fighters who were wounded or killed in the revolution.
6.
In addition the President and Prime Minister instructed Minister of Finance Hassan Ziglarn to develop an efficient
system to provide assistance funds to unemployed former fighters.
For his part, Ziglam privately expressed concern that previous efforts in this regard have met with a high level of fraud.
According to the government's best estimates, the revolutionary army included approximately 25,000 combat troops,
but it is difficult to identify those with legitimate claims, as no accurate service records were maintained.
That said, he stated in private that the government must be seen to take some form of direct action, even if money is
paid to fraudulent claimants.
The fact is, according to Ziglam, the NTC is losing control of the country and must give something to the veterans of the
revolution to slow this process.

concerned by the possibility that the country may deteriorate into a multi-sided civil war involving the regional militias,
Islamist forces and the national army.
At the same time, he acknowledges that the new army has lost control of large portions of the southern part of the
country, with tribal fighting spilling over into Mali and Chad.
According to this source, al-Juwali is also frustrated by the slow pace of military and police training promised to the
various Libyan national security forces by the governments of France and Turkey.
He added that, while Turkey has received some of the most seriously wound troops for treatment, the lack of
adequate medical care for veterans inside of Libya remains a major source of conflict between the former rebel troops
and the NTC government.

Re: France & UK behind Libya breakup
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of
European Governments, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, and Western Intelligence and security services
1. During the period between mid-January 2012 to March 2012 officers of the a French General Directorate for
External Security ( Direction Generale de la Securite Exterieure Dcsp, and the British Secret Intelligence Service
(SIS—Ml-8) activated longstanding contacts with tribal and civic leaders in Eastern Libya, in an effort to encourage them
to establish a semi-autonomous zone in the historic province of Cyrenaica (Barge in Arabic). According to extremely
knowledgeable sources, this effort was initiated by advisors to French President Nicholas Sarkozy after complaints from
concerned French business leaders that the new Libyan Government was not rewarding appropriately French firms for the
leading role France played in supporting the 2011 revolution against former Dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. SIS joined in
this effort at the instruction of the office of Prime Minister David Cameron. This highly confidential effort comes in
response to the inability of the National Transitional Council (NTC) government in Tripoli to organize the country
effectively and deal with Western business interests in an effective and efficient manner.
2. The French and British business and intelligence officials believe that a semi-autonomous regime in the
Eastern city of Benghazi will be able to organize business opportunities in that region. This in turn will allow these
Western firms to initiate new business projects. These same officials believe that there is also reduced threat from
Islamist militias in the East. According to a knowledgeable source, French officials believe that this situation is the natural
result of el-Keib's failure to organize the country and disarm the ethnic and regional militias who did the majority of the
fighting against Qaddafi's forces during the revolution.
3. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, the French Government and business leaders
actually expected to receive thirty five (35) per cent of new economic development in Libya after the fall of Qaddafi. Like
many Western businessmen, these French officials made informal agreements with former Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril
and his advisors, only to see these agreements ignored or delayed when Abdurrahim el-Keib became head of government
in October 2011. In their opinion, once el-Keib moved the government from the Eastern city of Benghazi to the national
capital at Tripoli, the government became inefficient and inaccessible. These individuals also believe that the

appointment of Minister of Oil Abduirahman Ben Yezza, who was a long time official of the Italian oil Company (EN!), was
a factor. According to these sources, the bulk of ENI's oil fields are in the Western part of Libya, and Ben Yezza focused
his attentions on that region, while failing to effectively organize new business East of Benghazi. These same officials
state that the influences of the Western militias, particularly those from the Zintan region, have weakened the influence of
the Eastern Elders.)
4. An extremely sensitive source stated that the DGSE and SIS intend to control the move toward a semi-
autonomous state under a federal system, However, they have been surprised by el-Keites intention, expressed both in
public and in secret meetings with Minister of Defense Ousama al JUWali, a native of Zintan, to use force to hold the
country together. El-Keth is also committed to Ben Yezza, although he is frustrated by the chaotic situation in Tripoli. This
atmosphere affects new business for the most part and has been extremely irritating for businessmen from France and
other Western countries.
5, (Source Comment: in the opinion of a well placed source with access to the former royal family (al Senussi),
while these Western officials are focused on working around the chaotic business situation, they are risking a civil war,
failing to reci !nized the longstanding and complicated relationship between the Eastern and Western parts of the country.
Qaddafi, as an absolute dictator, suppressed these differences, which have reemerged with his defeat and death. In
addition, el-Keib is talking to old acquaintances in the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, in an effort to apply their influence to
the Eastern tribal Eiders, and help hold the country together.)

DGSE), and the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS--MI-6) activated long standing contacts
with tribal and civic leaders in Eastern Libya, in an effort to encourage them to establish a semi-
autonomous zone in the historic province of Cyrenaica (Barqa in Arabic). According to
extremely knowledgeable sources, this effort was initiated by advisors to French President
Nicholas Sarkozy after complaints from concerned French business leaders that the new Libyan
Government was not rewarding appropriately French firms for the leading role France played in
supporting the 2011 revolution against former Dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. SIS joined in this
effort at the instruction of the office of Prime Minister David Cameron. This highly confidential
effort comes in response to the inability of the National Transitional Council (NTC) government
in Tripoli to organize the country effectively and deal with Western business interests in an
effective and efficient manner.
2. The French and British business and intelligence officials believe that a semi-
autonomous regime in the Eastern city of Benghazi will be able to organize business
opportunities in that region. This in turn will allow these Western firms to initiate new business
projects. These same officials believe that there is also reduced threat from Islamist militias in
the East. According to a knowledgeable source, French officials believe that this situation is the
natural result of el-Keib's failure to organize the country and disarm the ethnic and regional
militias who did the majority of the fighting against Qaddafi's forces during the revolution.

3. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, the French Government
and business leaders actually expected to receive thirty five (35) per cent of new economic
development in Libya after the fall of Qaddafi. Like many Western businessmen, these French
officials made informal agreements with former Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril and his
advisors, only to see these agreements ignored or delayed when Abdurrahim el-Keib became
head of government in October 2011. In their opinion, once el-Keib moved the government
from the Eastern city of Benghazi to the national capital at Tripoli, the government became
inefficient and inaccessible. These individuals also believe that the appointment of Minister of
Oil Abdulrahman Ben Yezza, who was a long time official of the Italian Oil Company (END,
was a factor. According to these sources, the bulk of ENI's oil fields are in the Western part of
Libya, and Ben Yezza focused his attentions on that region, while failing to effectively organize
new business East of Benghazi. These same officials state that the influences of the Western
militias, particularly those from the Zintan region, have weakened the influence of the Eastern
Elders.)
4. An extremely sensitive source stated that the DGSE and SIS intend to control the
move toward a semi-autonomous state under a federal system. However, they have been
surprised by el-Keib's intention, expressed both in public and in secret meetings with Minister of
Defense Ousama al Juwali, a native of Zintan, to use force to hold the country together. El-Keib
is also committed to Ben Yezza, although he is frustrated by the chaotic situation in Tripoli. This
atmosphere affects new business for the most part and has been extremely irritating for
businessmen from France and other Western countries
5. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a well placed source with access to the former
royal family (al Senussi), while these Western officials are focused on working around the
chaotic business situation, they are risking a civil war, failing to recognized the longstanding and
complicated relationship between the Eastern and Western parts of the country. Qaddafi, as an
absolute dictator, suppressed these differences, which have reemerged with his defeat and death.
In addition, el-Keib is talking to old acquaintances in the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, in an
effort to apply their influence to the Eastern tribal Elders, and help hold the country together.)

Re: Libyan election
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of
European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jalil expected the final days leading to the
July 7, 2012 national elections to be complicated and sometimes violent; however, according to a knowledgeable
individual, he is particularly concerned by the level of control exerted by regional militia's and political groups on the
electoral process. In the opinion of this individual, Jalil and his advisors believe that, given the level of suspicion and
frustration felt in the various parts of the country, it will be difficult for the new 200 seat General National Congress (GNC)
to establish its authority, draft a new constitution, and establish new national government. With this in mind, Jalil stated in
extreme confidence that the NTC may have to remain in power until the situation becomes stable and a new government
is firmly in place. That said he still plans to have interim Prime Minister Abdel Rahman el-Keib step down after the
election results have been certified. The NTC will then work with the GNC as it takes shape to choose a new Prime
Minister and Cabinet. Jalil would like to keep several ministers from the el-Keib government in the new regime,
particularly Minister of Defense Ousama al-Juwali.
2. According to this individual, Jalil wants to maintain a degree of security and stability in an effort to reassure
foreign businesses and banks that Libya will not descend into civil war and chaos. At the same time, the NTC must deal
with the regional issues that divide the country's three electoral regions: Tripolitania in the West, Cyrenaica (Barge) in the
East, and Fezzan in the South. In the weeks leading up to the election the failure of the NTC to resolve these differences
has strengthened the federalist movement in Barge while antagonizing the tribal leaders in the South. Both groups are
calling on their followers to boycott the election while the Southerners are calling for the National Army to withdraw its
forces from the area around the town of Kufra, where they are deployed to stop fighting between tribal militias. At the
same time, on July 1 federalist supporters attacked electoral offices in Benghazi, protesting the influence of Tripoli and the
Western region on the upcoming elections.

3. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a knowledgeable individual, the division of the 200 seats in the GNC lies
at the heart of this matter, with 120 seats allotted for the Tripolitania, 60 for Barqa, and 18 for the Fezzan area. At
present, the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood (LMB) and its political arm, the Justice and Construction Party (JCP), are
attempting to mount a national campaign, receiving discreet advice and technical support from the Egyptian Muslim
Brotherhood (EMB). With this assistance, Jalil is convinced that the JCP is the party that operates most effectively
throughout the country. Jalil has established ties to the EMB, from whom he has learned that JCP leader Mohamad
Sowan and his associates are working with the leadership of the EMB.)
4. According to his sources, Jalil believes that he can work with Sowan and the LMB/JCP; however, he is
concerned that Mohammed Morsi, the newly elected EMB President of Egypt, and EMB Supreme Guide Mohammed
Badie are focused on developing Egyptian influence in Libya. Jalil has been informed privately that these EMB leaders
want to establish a strong position in Libya, particularly in the oil services sector as part of their effort to improve Egypt's
economic situation. Libyan officials in Cairo and Jalil's own associates are warning him that the Egyptians may see the
NTC as a potential barrier to their effort and are advising Sowan to press for an early withdrawal of Jalil and the NTC from
Libyan politics. For his part, Jalil has attempted to avoided direct conflict with the LMB/JCP, focusing his attention, and
that of the el-Keib interim government on trying to deal with the unrest in the period leading up to the national elections.
5. According to a particularly sensitive source, Jalil believes that Sowan will need the assistance of the Libyan
National Party (LNP), the Islamist group led by religious scholar Ali al-Salabi and former Islamist militant
General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj to gain enough seats to control the GNC. While there are significant personal
conflicts between Sowan and Belhaj, Jalil believes that the two groups could work together to gain control of the
government. In this case, Jalil believes the new regime would move quickly to oust the NTC, and establish a more
conservative Islamist regime. At the same time, since the LNP is a Tripoli based movement, Jalil fears that the tribal
federalists in Barqa might react violently to them gaining an important role in the new government. Since the Barqa
leaders are urging their followers to boycott the election, a strong role for the LNP in coalition with the LMB/JCB could
lead to calls for Barge to secede from the Libya. (Source Comment: The LNP is dominated by the former leaders of the
Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (AI-Jamala al-Islamiyyah —LIFG), who, according to sensitive sources, maintained ties to al
Qa'ida during their struggle with the forces of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi.)
6. Former interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril is leading the National Forces Alliance (NFA),
an umbrella coalition of liberal parties that received Western support for efforts to overthrow the regime of Muammar al
Qaddafi. While Jibril is not on the list of candidates, his presence in the NFA leadership is seen by Belhaj and other
Islamists as an effort by the United States and Western Europe to manipulate the election. Jalil does not believe that the
NFA can gain control of enough seats in parliament to play a significant role in the new government. According to this
source, Jalil believes that former Oil and Finance Minister Ali Tarhouni also plays an important role in the NFA.
7. At the same time, Jafil is watching the progress of a second moderate party, the National Front (NF), which is
based on the work of a 1980s-era anti-Qaddafi exile organization. The party is led by Mohammed al-Magariaf, an exiled
intellectual dissident leader from a prominent Eastern Libyan family. Jalil's sources advise that the NF is also backed by
the al-Sennusi tribe, the former Libyan royal family, who may be looking to play a role in a semi-autonomous or
independent Barqa. One particularly sensitive source noted that many of the NF leaders have ties to the United States,
Italy and the United Kingdom, and at one point Jalil believed that the NF might be able to work with the NFA; however,
personal differences between the leaders of the two parties made effective cooperation difficult.
8. (Source Comment: In the end, a particularly sensitive source stated in confidence that Jalil believes the
LMB/JCB will have a significant role in the new government, possibly supported by the LNP. However; he points out that
since accurate polling is nonexistent it is impossible to predict a victor with any accuracy. Jaill also noted that it is quite
possible that no group will win a clear victory, which, when added to the boycotts and pre-election violence may require
the NTC maintain control of the country for some time to come. Accordingly, he has instructed al-Juwali to prepare to use
the National Army to maintain order. For his part Al-Juwali has warned that this will be a difficult task since the best units
of the Army, including many of its armored forces are deployed in the Kufra region of the Southeast, in an effort to control
tribal conflicts, stem the flow of weapons into the country from South Sudan, and resist Qaddafi loyalists amongst the
nomadic tribes of the region.)

Another report--
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of
European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. As of the morning of July 6, an individual with access to the information stated in confidence that Libyan National
Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jalil remains committed to a transfer of power to a popularly elected
government; however, he is prepared to ex-tend the life of the NTC as a guarantor of stability for the Libyan people
following the July 7, 2012 election for seats in a 200-member General National Congress (GNC). Jaifi realizes that 2.7
million Libyans have registered to vote and are generally anxious to replace the increasingly unpopular NTC. That said,
JAI expects the voting to lead to a period of confusion and he will not abandon his authority until the results are fixed.
2. Jalil is also frustrated by the fact that during its eight-month tenure of the administration of Prime Minister Abclel
Rahman el-Keib - who was appointed by the NTC was unable to provide solutions for Libya's long list of needs: a
functioning justice system, a reconciliation process for officials who served the old administration, the disarming of
militia, building functional national security forces, rebuilding destroyed areas, and delivering basic services such as
healthcare.
3. At the same time, outside of the oil sector, much of Libya's economy is stagnant, and in the opinion of Western
security officials, lacks the government's go-ahead to restart public sector infrastructure contracts. In addition,
international advisers and foreign investors are reluctant to return to an environment where the government will not
sign long term agreements and cannot guarantee security.
4.(Source Comment: According to an extremely sensitive source, Jalil continues to believe that this chaotic situation
should not be surprising. He regularly points out that eight months is not a sufficient amount of time to build functioning
institutions from the remnants of the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. The old regime featured a
dysfunctional bureaucracy, idiosyncratic rule, and anti-institutionalism. Additionally, Jaill now re
Ializes that due to
pronounced incompetence and a lack of will to take unpopular decisions the el-Keib government also failed to make
progress in the few areas where it could have achieved meaningful change. The towns of Sirte and Tawargha are
representative of the situation in the countryside where people lost their homes in the conflict and have been living in
temporary camps with limited ability to register and vote in their home district. Jalil has been urged by contacts in the
French and Italian Governments to guarantee the rights of people across the country in particular, he has serious
concerns as to whether or not supporters of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi in his hometown of Sirte will be
included in the future political processes of the new Libya; if they are not allowed to vote by local militiamen. At the
same time, the fighting between Libyan Arabs and Tebta tribesmen in the Kufra area threatens to prevent any voting
there. Jalil has been warned that the NTC regulations now state that members of the National Army are not allowed to
vote or run for office, which is a disincentive for armed militia brigade members to become legitimate soldiers.)
5.This well informed individual believes that despite these flaws, the new government created by the July 7 election will
eventually have the mandate to take the difficult decisions that can create a reconciliation process. Jalil will work to
maintain order in this transition period, and finally reach his goal of creating a situation where the government can
rebuild homes and restore sufficient law and order; allowing those in Sirte, Tawargha, Kufra, and throughout the rest of
the country to live in their hometowns, establishing a situation where a true civil society can develop.

6. Jail!, in conversations with the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB), and separately with liberal leader Ali
Tarhouni, has acknowledged that the central government's top priority must be security and that the NTC has been
unable to provide it. That said, Jail! and Minister of Defense Ousarna alefuwali have pledged to provide 30,000 to 40,000
security personnel for election day to prevent similar incidents to the July 1 attack on Benghazi's election headquarters.
In that case eastern federalists entered the building, where ballot papers were burned and ballot boxes destroyed.
Similarly, these federalist forces are suspected of the attack on July 5 that burned down Ajdabiya's main storage centre
for election materials.
7. In the opinion of this individual, although those responsible for the Benghazi attack were pro-federalist, it has not
been proven that they were members of the self-appointed Cyrenaican National Council (MC), whose military arm set
up a roadblock in Wadi al-Ahmar on Libya's major east-west highway to demand that Cyrenaica get as many seats in the
GNC as Tripolitania. Thus far, neither the CNC nor any other group has publicly stated that they intend to use violence to
disrupt the elections. (Note: Under the current system Tripolitania will have 120 seats in the GNC, Cyrenaica (Barge) 62,
and Fezzan in the South 18.)

frustration felt in the various parts of the country, it will be difficult for the new 200 seat General National Congress (GNC)
to establish its authority, draft a new constitution, and establish new national government. With this in mind, Jalil stated in
extreme confidence that the NTC may have to remain in power until the situation becomes stable and a new government
is firmly in place. That said he still plans to have interim Prime Minister Abdel Rahman el-Keib step down after the
election results have been certified. The NTC will then work with the GNC as it takes shape to choose a new Prime
Minister and Cabinet. Jalil would like to keep several ministers from the el-Keib government in the new regime,
particularly Minister of Defense Ousama al-Juwali.
2. According to this individual, Jalil wants to maintain a degree of security and stability in an effort to reassure
foreign businesses and banks that Libya will not descend into civil war and chaos. At the same time, the NTC must deal
with the regional issues that divide the country's three electoral regions: Tripolitania in the West, Cyrenaica (Barqa) in the
East, and Fezzan in the South. In the weeks leading up to the election the failure of the NTC to resolve these differences
has strengthened the federalist movement in Barqa while antagonizing the tribal leaders in the South. Both groups are
calling on their followers to boycott the election while the Southerners are calling for the National Army to withdraw its
forces from the area around the town of Kufra, where they are deployed to stop fighting between tribal militias. At the
same time, on July 1 federalist supporters attacked electoral offices in Benghazi, protesting the influence of Tripoli and the
Western region on the upcoming elections.

3. (Source Comment In the opinion of a knowledgeable individual, the division of the 200 seats in the GNC lies
at the heart of this matter, with 120 seats allotted for the Tripolitania, 60 for Banta, and 18 for the Fezzan area. At
present, the Libyan MUSlifIl Brotherhood (LMB) and its political arm, the Justice and Construction Party (JCP), are
attempting to mount a national campaign, receiving discreet advice and technic.al support from the Egyptian Muslim
Brotherhood (EMB). Withthis assistance, Jalil is convinced that the JCP is the party that operates most effectively
throughout the country. JO has established ties to the EMB, from whom he has learned that JCP leader Mohamed
Sowan and his associates are working with the leadership of the EMB.)
4, According to his sources, Jai believes that he can work with Sowan and the LMB/JCP; however, he is
concerned that Mohammed Morsi, the newly elected EMB President of Egypt and EMB Supreme Guide Mohammed
Bathe are focused on developing Egyptian influence in Libya. Jalil has been informed privately that these EMS leaders
want to establish a strong position in Libya, particularly in the oil services sector as part of their effort to improve Egypt's
economic situation. Libyan officials in Cairo and Jallfs own associates are warning him that the Egyptians may see the
NTC as a potential barrier to their effort and are advising Sowan to press for an early withdrawal of Jalil and the NTC from
Libyan politics. For his part, Jalil has attempted to avoided direct conflict with the LMB/JCP, focusing his attention, and
that of the el-keib interim government on trying to deal with the unrest in the period leading up to the national elections.
5. According to a particularly sensitive source, Jalil believes that Sowan will need the assistance of the Libyan
National Party (LNP), the Islamist group led by religious scholar All al-Salabi and former Islarnist militant
General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj to gain enough seats to control the GNC. While there are significant personal
conflicts between Sowan and Bethel Jalii believes that the two groups could work together to gain control of the
government. In this case, Jalil believes the new regime would move quickly to oust the RITC, and establish a more
conservative Islamist regime. At the same time since the LNP is a Tn'poli based movement, Jalil fears that the tribal
federalists in Barge might react violently to them gaining an important role in the new government. Since the Barge
leaders are urging their followers to boycott the election, a strong role for the LNP in coalition with the LMB/JCB could
lead to calls for Barge to secede from the Libya. (Source Comment: The LNP is dominated by the former leaders of the
Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (AI-Jama'a al-Islamiyyah —LIFG), who according to sensitive sources, maintained ties to at
Oalcia during their struggle with the forces of former dictator !Muenster at Qaddafi.)
6. Former interim Prime Minister Mahmotel Jibril is leading the National Forces Alliance (NFA),
an umbrella coalition of liberal parties that received Western support for efforts to overthrow the regime of Nluammar at
Qaddafi. VVhile Jibril is not on the list of candidates, his presence in the NFA leadership is seen by Belhaj and other
Islamists as an effort by the United States and Western Europe to manipulate the election. Jalil does not believe that the
NFA can gain control of enough seats in parliament to play a significant role in the new government. According to this
source, Jalil believes that former Oil and Finance Minister Ali Tanhouni also plays an important role in the NFA.
7, At the same time Jalil is watching the progress of a second moderate party, the National Front (NF), which is
based on the work of a 1980s-era anti-Qaddafi exile organization. The party is led by Mohammed al-Magariaf, an exiled
intellectual dissident leader from a prominent Eastern Libyan family, Jai's sources advise that the NF is also backed by
the al-Sennusi tribe, the former Libyan royal family, who may be looking to play a role in a semi-autonomous or
independent Barga. One particularly sensitive source noted that many of the NF leaders have ties to the United States,
Italy and the United Kingdom, and at one point Jalil believed that the NF might be able to work with the NFA; however,
personal differences between the leaders of the two parties made effective cooperation difficult.
8. (Source Comment: In the end, a particularly sensitive source stated in confidence that Jalil believes the
LNIBIJCB will have a significant role in the new government possibly supported by the LNP. However; he points out that
since accurate polling is nonexistent it is impossible to predict a victor with any accuracy. Jaill also noted that it is quite
possible that no group will win a clear victory, which, when added to the boycotts and pre-election violence may require
the NTC maintain control of the country for some time to come. Accordingly, he has instructed ahArwalii to prepare to use
the National Army to maintain order. For his part Al-Juwali has warned that this will be a difficult task since the best units
of the Army, including many of its armored forces are deployed in the kutra region of the Southeast, in an effort to control
tribal conflicts, stem the flow of weapons into the country from South Sudan, and resist Qaddati loyalists amongst the
nomadic tribes of the region.)

Re: New president of Libya
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels
of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. During early August, 2012, Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel
Jalil held discreet meetings with Mohammed Yussef Magariaf, the then leader of the newly elected General
National Congress (GNC), who Jalil learned was to be named interim President of Libya when the NTC stepped
down. During these sessions the two leaders worked out the transition to a new, elected interim Government for
Libya; focusing on the need to restore stability and security by disarming the militia units which fought in the
2011 revolution against former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. According to a source with excellent access to
both parties, _Tani came away from the meeting convinced that Magariaf is intent on becoming Libya's first
elected president following the overthrow of Qaddafi. Jalil was pleased to learn that Magariaf strongly supports
the three-party Cairo Declaration negotiated between the NTC and the Governments of Tunisia and Egypt in
late July allowing for increased trade and a relaxation of existing travel restrictions.
2. According to this individual, Jalil and Magariaf agree that Tunisia and Egypt hold the key to Libya's
future economic success, with Libya providing the funding for new projects, while Egypt and Tunisia provide
technical expertise. Magariaf stated privately that this relationship marks a departure from the Qaddafi years
when Libya's natural resources fell under the control of foreign firms and governments. Jalil added that
Magariaf will welcome investment and cooperation from American and Western European banks and

corporations, but believes Libya, supported by the new governments rising out of the Arab Spring, must
maintain control over all aspects of the industries involved in exploiting its natural resources. In this regard,
with the support of both Jalil and Magariaf, the Libyan Ministry of Finance is increasing the level of Libyan
investment in the Cairo stock exchange. In turn, Magariaf and Egyptian President Mohamad Morsi discussed
increased Tunisian and Egyptian investment in the Benghazi stock exchange as the economic situation in Libya
becomes more orderly.
1 In commenting on the new Interim President, Jalil added that Magariaf s current position is bolstered
by the fact that he is not tied to any particular faction. At the same time he has maintained the respect that is
attached to his role as the first Libyan leader to direct an armed revolt against Qaddafi. This fighting was
carried out by the rebel Libyan National Army in 1981. Magariaf is an academic and diplomat with well
established Islamist credentials and good relationships with business and government leaders in the United
States and Western Europe. A separate sensitive source noted that one interesting issue to watch is Magariaf s
relationship with General Khalifa Belqasim Haftar, the commander of one sections of the new Libyan Army.
Haftar has been at odds with many of the militia commanders and is currently leading Libyan forces in the
Kufra region, attempting to end local tribal fighting and block the smuggling of arms and supplies to pro-
Qaddafi militias by supporters based in South Sudan. In the years between 1981 and 1990 Haftar (then Colonel
Haftar) commanded the rebel Libyan National Army, under Magariaf s National Front for the Salvation of
Libya (NFSL). One source notes that Magariaf s opposition to Qaddafi was based on the dictator's betrayal of
Islamic principles, a position that, at that time, was supported by the Western Allies.
4. According to this individual, Jalil also spoke with former Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril, who
indicated that he and Magariaf agree on many issues, including the belief that they can build an Islamic state in
Libya that can function in the world economy and the international diplomatic community. He did note that he
believes Magariaf s view of the role of Islam in the day to day function of the government is more conservative
than his, but these are differences that can be sorted out in the GNC. In the opinion of this individual Jabril is
well aware of the fact that, while his National Force Alliance (NFA) controls a solid bloc of thirty nine (39)
seats in the GNC and Magariaf s National Front Party (NFP) holds no seats in its own right, the interim
President has established good working relationships with at least 100 of the 120 independent members of the
GNC. Magariaf received 113 votes in his election as Interim President. Again these independent deputies
respect Magariaf s role in fighting the Qaddafi regime.
5.(Source Comment: This particularly sensitive individual stated in strict confidence that Magariaf sees
his role as establishing an efficient interim government, while overseeing the drafting of a new constitution and
election law. This individual believes that Magariaf is very interested in winning the presidency under this new
law. Besides meeting with Jalil and Jibril, Magariaf is talking to liberal politicians including former Oil and
Finance Minister Ali Tarhouni, and the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood's (MB) Justice and Construction
Party (JCP), including Mohamad Sowan.)
6. This individual adds that Jalil believes Magariaf will face a very difficult period as he addresses the
many issues left unresolved by the NTC and the interim regime of Prime Minister Abdel Rahman el-Keib. Jalil
has been highly frustrated by el-Keib's inability to disarm the many militia units left over from the 2011
revolution against Qaddafi. At the same time he has advised Magariaf to move quickly in replacing el-Keib's
cabinet while deciding which ministers to retain. The new interim government is facing a problem of
lawlessness and attacks against foreigners, including representatives of the Egyptian Government; this at a time
when the new Muslim Brotherhood government of Egypt is reaching out to increase business and diplomatic
contacts between the two countries. According to a sensitive source, Libyan military intelligence officers
believe these attacks are the work of Qaddafi loyalists, while former NTC officials fear that they may be carried
out by dissident Islamist groups, frustrated with the results of the national elections, which many of them
boycotted.

7. (Source Comment: An extremely sensitive source stated in confidence that Libyan Military
Intelligence officers reported to Jalil and later Magariaf that a series of bombings in Tripoli and Benghazi
appear to be the work of Qaddafi loyalists looking to create tension between the Libyan and Egyptian
Governments. These attacks included the ear of an Egyptian diplomat, which was blown up near his home in
Benghazi, a day after several deadly bomb attacks in the capital Tripoli. At the same time, a homemade bomb
exploded under the vehicle of the Egyptian consulate's first secretary Abdelhatniti Rifai in one of the Tripoli's
most affluent neighborhoods. No one was hurt during this attack. Earlier in August, three car bombs exploded
near the Ministry of Interior in Tripoli, killing two people and wounding three others. This sensitive source
added that security officers arrested 32 members of what they describe as an organized network of Gaddafi
loyalists linked to the attacks. During this period, the Red Cross suspended its activities in Benghazi and
Misrata after one of its compounds in Misrata was attacked with grenades and rockets. In late July seven
Iranian relief workers associated with the Libyan Red Crescent were kidnapped by tribal troops still loyal to the
Qaddafi family. Security officials have no word on the whereabouts of these relief workers.)
8. According to this source, while the Cairo Declaration received a positive reception among Libyan
political and business leaders, it also created a drastic increase in the number of Libyan's applying for Egyptian
visas under the new, simplified process. This workload has created a backlog of applications, and in mid
August, a group of Libyan nationals frustrated with the Egyptian visa process attacked the interior of the
Egyptian consulate in Tripoli. These Libyan applicants were angry about the time it was taking to receive visas
to enter Egypt and were demanding that the staff work past their stated hours of operation. A sensitive source
noted that a number of Libyans destroyed the furniture in the main waiting room and attacked the consulate.
The Magariaf Government has assured the Egyptian ambassador that additional security personnel will be
assigned to guard the Embassy, at least until the visa backlog is reduced.

1. (Source Comment: As the new interim President of Libya Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf is
determined to establish a democratic state based on Islamic principles. In the opinion of an
extremely sensitive source, Magariaf sees this moment as the climax his entire life's work. Having
first served deposed dictator Muammar al Qaddafi as a policy advisor and diplomat, in 1979 Magariaf
became disenchanted with what he saw as the cult of personality that Qaddafi was building for
himself while turning against the basic beliefs of the Islamist movement. Magariaf was member of the
Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood in his student days and remains a devout Islamist intellectual, albeit
one who believes that Islam can coexist and even work with the non-Muslim world, particularly the
United States and Western Europe. This source also believes that Magariaf is convinced that Libya,
with its great natural wealth, can become a leading player in North Africa, as well as the rest of the
Islamic world. Magariaf is particularly well disposed toward the governments of the United States
and France, based on past experiences with each during his struggle with Qaddafi. This source also
believes that he remains hostile to the government of Omar al Bashir in Sudan. In 1989 Bashir
overthrew Magariafs ally, then Sudanese Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi and expelled Magariaf and
his followers from Khartoum.)

2. According to the same sensitive source, MagariafwiU also seek a discreet relationship with
Israel. Political realities in Libya at present will dictate that this relationship be handled in a low key
manner, but the new President of Libya shares many common friends and associates with the leaders
of Israel and intends to take advantage of this situation to improve the lot of the Libyan people.
Magariaf may, at times, be forced to make statements critical of Israel for his own political purposes,
but believes he and his associates have the experience and sophistication to manage this issue. At the
same time Magariaf intends to pursue aggressively the regional political initiatives begun by National
Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jalil. Magariaf will pursue the economic and
security cooperation set out in the Cairo Declaration of July 29, 2012 establishing a regional bond
between the new revolutionary governments of Tunisia, Libya and Egypt. This same individual notes
that Magariaf is aware of the fact that Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi sees Libya as a key factor
in Egypt's economic development; and the Libyan leader believes he can manipulate this situation to
the advantage of the Libyan people.
3. A separate sensitive source stated on condition of strict secrecy that Magariaf intends to
work with his security advisors to develop a plan for disarming the Islamist militias who fought
against Qaddafi, without arousing their suspicion. He believes that the most important step in this
matter will be providing the medical and economic services demanded by these militias in return for
disarming. Magariaf also believes that he can manage the political ambitions of Islamist leaders like
General Abdelhakim Belhaj, while preventing the growth of radical groups who might see Libya as a
base of operations and support. Magariaf and his supporters believe that his Islamist/anti-Qaddafi
credentials will allow him to manage these challenges, and if he can do so he will be able to win the
presidency outright in the first full scale national presidential election in the spring of 2013.
4. This source adds that, while avoiding direct involvement in the Syrian crisis, the Magariaf
government will support Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the rest of the nations calling for the end of
the regime of Basher al Assad. Magariaf harbors a particular sense of hostility toward Assad, who was
a longtime ally of Qaddafi, supporting him with equipment, intelligence, and advisors throughout the
revolution of 2011. Magariaf realizes that this stance will also bring him into conflict with Syria's ally
Iran, but does not believe Iran has a role to play in Libya, or the rest of North Africa.
5. According to an extremely sensitive source, in 1979 Magariaf, having become increasingly
disenchanted with Qaddafi, fled Libya for Khartoum in Sudan, where in 1981, with the help of the
government of Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi, Chadian leader Hissene Habre, Iraqi President
Sadaam Hussein, and several Western states, he established The National Front for the Salvation of
Libya (NFSL), dedicated to overthrowing Qaddafi and establishing an Islamic democracy in Libya.
Under the auspices of the NFSL, Magariaf also organized the Libyan National Army (LNA), based in
Ndjamena, Chad. The LNA was commanded by the Colonel Khalifa Belqasim Haftar, who is now one
of the commanding generals of the new Libyan Army. Under Magariaf s authority the Haftar force,
which numbered between 2,500 and 3,000 troops, fought several battles with Qaddafi's troops, with
mixed results. These attacks included a raid on Qaddafi's compound at Bab al-Aziza in 1986. The
LNA also maintained a 50,000 watt radio station in Ndjamena, broadcasting anti-Qaddafi material
into Libya. This radio station was supported by Western governments and Iraqi Military Intelligence.
6. The LNA's greatest success came in support of the Chadian Army under General Idriss
Deby, in their overwhelming victory over Libyan troops at the battle Quadi Doum in 1987. This
victory forced the Libyan Army and Air Force out of Chad, and was supported by the French Air Force
and other Western personnel. Following the battle Deby became a national hero in Chad. In 1990,
with the support of Libyan intelligence officers, Deby, who had undergone military training in Libya
and France, rebelled against and overthrew the Habre Government. At that time Deby, under
Qaddafi's influence, forced the LNA to abandon Chad for Zaire, and eventually the United States.
Magariaf and Haftar both settled in the United States, and while the LNA no longer existed as an

effective force, Magariaf continued to maintain the NFSL as a political organization. In 2004
Magariaf and the NFSL joined the National Conference for the Libyan Opposition (NCLO), eventually
returning to support the 2011revolution.
7. (Source Comment: In the opinion of an extremely sensitive source speaking on condition of
strict secrecy, Magariaf views himself as an Islamist politician who can work with both Islamic and
non-Islamic states, including Israel, if the relationships are properly managed. The Libyan President
also sees the current situation as vindication for all of the problematic experiences he encountered in
his long struggle against the Qaddafi regime. This individual believes that Magariaf intends to use his
reputation for integrity, commitment to Islam, and his ability to work with divergent groups to
establish himself as an effective interim President, and eventually the first elected Libyan Head of
State in mid-2013. Magariaf plans to draw on all political, religious, and ethnic groups to form his
cabinet, using his stature to form a representative government under the General National Council.)

Re: New President of Libya
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. (Source Comment: As the new interim President of Libya Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf is
determined to establish a democratic state based on Islamic principles. In the opinion of an
extremely sensitive source, Magariaf sees this moment as the climax his entire life's work. Having
first served deposed dictator Muammar al Qaddafi as a policy advisor and diplomat, in 1979 Magariaf
became disenchanted with what he saw as the cult of personality that Qaddafi was building for
himself while turning against the basic beliefs of the Islamist movement. Magariaf was member of the
Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood in his student days and remains a devout Islamist intellectual, albeit
one who believes that Islam can coexist and even work with the non-Muslim world, particularly the
United States and Western Europe. This source also believes that Magariaf is convinced that Libya,
with its great natural wealth, can become a leading player in North Africa, as well as the rest of the
Islamic world. Magariaf is particularly well disposed toward the governments of the United States
and France, based on past experiences with each during his struggle with Qaddafi. This source also
believes that he remains hostile to the government of Omar al Bashir in Sudan. In 1989 Bashir
overthrew Magariafs ally, then Sudanese Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi and expelled Magariaf and
his followers from Khartoum.)

2. According to the same sensitive source, Magariaf will also seek a discreet relationship with
Israel. Political realities in Libya at present will dictate that this relationship be handled in a low key
manner, but the new President of Libya shares many common friends and associates with the leaders
of Israel and intends to take advantage of this situation to improve the lot of the Libyan people.
Magariaf may, at times, be forced to make statements critical of Israel for his own political purposes,
but believes he and his associates have the experience and sophistication to manage this issue. At the
same time Magariaf intends to pursue aggressively the regional political initiatives begun by National
Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jail. Magariaf will pursue the economic and
security cooperation set out in the Cairo Declaration of July 29, 2012 establishing a regional bond
between the new revolutionary governments of Tunisia, Libya and Egypt. This same individual notes
that Magariaf is aware of the fact that Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi sees Libya as a key factor

Hope you are well and had a nice Easter. Had a terrific trip to Middle East...boy, is the Secretary a hit there!
Good neWs....Heather Samuelson has informed me that I have received
Everything has been submitted and I am hoping that I can be thru the process by May 7 in
order to go to the NPT review conference in NY. Hopefully will be confirmed by then, too.
Sharon Hardy has arranged for me to come to State on Wednesday at 10 am to get my security badge and DS briefing. I
will have a temporary office in the Transition area until I am confirmed.
Do you have some time Wednesday morning...or can we have lunch? I'd like to hear how the situation is
flushing out and go over some ideas/issues with you. I'm leaving town Thursday for a long weekend on what expect will
be my last Congressional break.
All the best,

large scale job creation, for example through direct involvement of OPIC. In my report I pointed out that the port in Port-
au-Prince is the most expensive port in the Caribbean and recommended the opening of new private ports. Ports
remain a critical bottleneck to a job creation strategy both in garment manufacturing and agriculture. They also play a
pivotal role in ensuring that some of the complementary imports necessary for the proposed road construction projects
can enter the country both in the required quantities and in a cost-effective and timely manner. Elsewhere I have argued
that spiraling prices in construction booms often mean that available funds only go half way to the finishing line.
The Haitian authorities have already made inroads in addressing some of these inefficiencies and stand ready to
do more. In fact, Prime Minister Pierre-Louis noted in the letter to investors which was presented at the meeting with

Charles Rangel and garment entrepreneurs on Monday, that "ISPS certification of port facilities and alleviation of
customs procedures" are in progress. The meetings tomorrow may present an opportunity to emphasize once again
how central well-functioning, competitive ports are to attract foreign investors as part of the HOPEI! window and to put
the right transport infrastructure in place.

i like virtually everything in the two-pager, and I do agree with Tom on the notion of elevating the "national interest"
and security elements of this, both because those have become part of her "brand," and also to help flesh it out in a way
that both gives it the widest reach, and also protects it from attack.
some ways to consider doing that might be to just ensure that the overarching description of it "call out" the national
interest/security reasoning at work - something like "America has the opportunity and the responsibility to lead in the
creation of a network of principled partnerships that will serve our national interest, enhance our security and build the
capacity of people and nations to solve global problems and give everyone more power to reach their potential."
(i inserted "network" of principled partnerships because i think it kind of alludes to both the diversity of the kinds of
partnerships as well as to the influence of technology on building them...not a "must have" but just a thought....in the
same vein, i don't know whether there might be an advantage in alluding to a network of "pragmatic and principled
partnerships" or "practical and principled partnerships" just to ensure it's got that pragmatism aspect of it sharply
inserted).

I like the substance and I might consider if there are ways to communicate, or more strongly affirm, some
elements that would be important for audiences to hear, including that this is an approach of leadership, self-interest,
and values. The values I mean are things like security, stability and building opportunity. Those pieces are in here, but
the notion should be clear that we are not ceding leadership, we are leading by building alliances and partnerships. And
we will always stand for what is right and the right to defend ourselves and our allies, but we are fighting as we always
have for shared values. Make sense? Tom

Cheryl, I'm resending a message that I first sent on April 14. I can imagine how flooded your inbox is, but I'd be grateful
if you could give me some idea of whether what I'm proposing below might work. If there's any chance, I'll send you the

BTW, I've heard terrific reports about the Sec's Town Meeting in Iraq yesterday, including from my friend

One other thing (speaking of ambassadorships), I'm concerned about what I gather may happen with regard to the
Tokyo embassy—not least because the Japanese are getting concerned. I realize the locus of decision-making there is
the White House, but given the terrific start the HRC gave to the US-Japan relationship by going to Tokyo first on her trip
to Asia, I'd be sorry to see any, setback there.
Here follows my earlier message....
Hi, Cheryl. I wanted to take a quiet sounding with you about possibly getting a bit of time for the Brookings board of
trustees and International Advisory Council on June 4. If there's any possibility at all, I'll come in, via any channel you
suggest, with a formal request, but here's the essence of it: we've got a very distinguished board which she's met with
before (a week after the 2004 election), plus a group of 20+ high-level international types
etc.). We could do it in a way that minimizes the imposition on her time—i.e., bring the group into the
department an assemble in the Loy Henderson auditorium (or whatever it's called these days, or a similar 1st floor
venue), and she comes down and talks to us for 15 minutes and take 15 minutes of questions, over and out. We did this

Dear Burns,
It was good to talk with you again this morning. I am grateful for your willingness to help the Council of Bishops. The
following are dates and times that are available:
Sunday, May 3, 6:00 PM dinner - This is the opening dinner for the Council in which all of the bishops will be present. It
will be at the American University Katzman Arts Center (right on the Nebraska Circle).
Wednesday, May 6, 6:00 PM dinner - Again all of the bishops will be present. This dinner will be at the Bethesda Hyatt,
7400 Wisconsin Avenue.

Another option is on Tuesday, May 6, any time between 2:00 and 4 PM with a group of bishops who are available to
come to the State Department.
Also a group of bishops are available for breakfast or lunch Tuesday through Thursday.
Our first hope is either the Sunday or Wednesday for dinner.

John and Burns, Great talking to you both this evening.
Burns, the United Methodist Bishops from around the world are coming to the Washington area for a weeklong
gathering of bishops. Bishop John is host and arranging their schedule. John can tell you more details ...
it would be wonderful if a time could be found sometime during the week
(Sunday-Friday) for Hillary to meet with the entire group of bishops (around 100 total) or at least the leaders of the
African bishops (perhaps a group of 10 or so).

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05758447 Date: 06/30/2015
John notes that the group can be flexible and accomodate Hillary's busy schedule. He suggests that there are a couple
of ideal evening opportunities where all the bishops will be present: this Sunday evening at 6 pm at American
University's Arts Center, or Wednesday at 6 pm at the Hyatt in Bethesda. There also is a Tuesday evening gathering and
reception with just the African bishops -- 7 pm onwards at AP Shaw UMC in SE DC.
If it is not possible for her to go to the bishops, I wonder whether it might be possible for a smaller group (eg, John, the
African bishops and a couple others) to come to the State Department for a meeting in the Secretary's suite or
conference room on the 7th floor. The Secretary obviously has a very busy schedule, but it might well be possible to find
20-30 minutes sometime during the week at the Department. (I haven't yet done so, but I will check the State Dept
website and see what her announced travel schedule is.)
I am happy to help however I can, though it probably is easiest if you coordinate directly. Feel free to copy me at the
above emails if I can be helpful. Here are your cell numbers: Bishop John's is
Burns's is
God's blessings to you both,

This is about Sri Lankan Govt and the Tigers...
I have a good source.
This was shared to me at my and Karen's Derby Party yesterday (can you believe the 50 to 1 odds winner?).
There was a meeting held with Geitner asked for and led by IMF... They told him you were intruding into his domain by
ordering/telling IMF to suspend funding to Sri Lakan Govt.
My take is that the people on the ground both with World Bank and IMF believe the Tigers need to be completely
defeated and any collateral damage inflicted on private people by SL govt in process is ok... They also believe Tigers are
better at propaganda than SL govt...
I have no idea what reality is... I know all about the conflict because there's been so much written over time but no idea
of reality on ground.
My point is that IMF/World Bank is hoping to get Geitner to intervene and they recently played to his sense of who is US
point person on IMF... So, that's what I know. I'll keep my ears open.

EUR tells me that they have engaged fully with Ambassador Bagley and Kris Balderston on this project, and that
Ambassador Bagley has spoken with the Italian Ambassador and reviewed the proposed approach. She said he thought
that it sounded like a good plan and would be warmly received. They are ready to convene a meeting with the NIAF
President as soon as the Secretary approves the action memo.

Subject: Followup
Here's a partial list of followup from our last trip and the last week:
What can we do to help protect the Christians in Iraq as requested by Ken Joseph whom we saw in Baghdad?
JoDee Winterhof raised questions about how the PRTs and the language DOD uses about them are problematic for
NGOs like care.
Pls ask one of Holbrooke's people if they ever talked to Wolfgang Danspeckgruber at Princeton about building a railroad
in Aghanistan.
Also Dr. Arthur Keys at International Relief + Development wanted to talk w someone from Holbrooke's team about
development in Af.
I asked the Spec IG for Af Recon, Arnold Fields, to alert us to problems as soon as they can. I'm not sure how to formalize
this or even if it's appropriate. Let's discuss.
What are the "Iran Watchers"?

Madam Secretary-
I hope this note finds you and your family doing well. I've been following all of your activities over the last several
months. You are doing an incredible job, which I'm sure is a surprise to no one. I'm going to be in DC May 19-21. We
have our annual gathering out there with about 150 folks coming out from the Exchange. I know this is probably a long
shot at best, but we are having a dinner for our group at the Hay Adams on Tuesday, May 19 and it would be a
tremendous honor if you would come by and say a few words. If this doesn't work but you are in town, I'd love to stop
by for 5 minutes to say hello. Please let me know if any of this is possible. I look forward to seeing you soon.

months. You are doing an incredible job, which I'm sure is a surprise to no one. I'm going to be in DC May 19-21. We
have our annual gathering out there with about 150 folks coming out from the Exchange. I know this is probably a long
shot at best, but we are having a dinner for our group at the Hay Adams on Tuesday, May 19 and it would be a
tremendous honor if you would come by and say a few words. If this doesn't work but you are in town, I'd love to stop
by for 5 minutes to say hello. Please let me know if any of this is possible. I look forward to seeing you soon.
All my best,
Terry

Cheryl:
In anticipation of our meeting tomorrow, below and attached are a timeline and deliverables as we discussed last week.
I am having a lot of fun. I'm working my tail off, which I enjoy. If demand is an indicator of performance, I think I'm
getting off to a strong start. I'm wound up about my concept of 21st century statecraft (and loved hearing those words
come out of HRC's mouth at NYU) and am wound up about the possibilities of government to people and people to
government communication as a way of revolutionizing statecraft and empowering people across the globe. I think this
can be a major part of HRC's legacy.
Anyway ... here's the requested content for your review:

Media: Although the families have thus far shown restraint from approaching the media to publicize their story, they
are increasingly anxious in response to the DPRK's announcement of a June 4 trial date. They now feel that a media
appeal is necessary and would be helpful to their case, citing the public attention given the Saberi case. They are
considering doing interviews on Larry King Live and/or The O'Reilly Factor. 1.4(D)

Hilary,
You may know but for the last four years I have been working with the Qatari's and in particular with Sheikha Moser on
disability issues in Qatar and I have built up a good relationship with them
Sheikha Moser has approached me privately saying they are keen to get their relationship with the USA onto a more
positive footing and she was hoping for a "women-to women" one to one private meeting with you. She is happy to
come to Washington if you could make some time available.
Is this something you would be prepared o do. Sheikha Moser is someone who has real influence in Qatar and she has
made a lot of difference already with her education city and with the Shaffalah Centre for people with Disabilities in
which I am involved as the Co Chair of its Annual Disability conference. I am sure the conversation would not be
confined to these issues but would be about the US/Qatar relationship generally.

Hillary,
The email below from Sally Osberg, President of the Skoll Foundation reminds me that right after the Skoll Forum in
Oxford, I wrote Cheryl indicating your interest in meeting with Jeff Skoll. I sent another email on this and a couple of
other meetings I think important (Jacqueline Novogratz, Acumen) but have never heard anything from her. I really do
think it would be valuable for you to meet Jeff Skoll, and to talk with Jacqueline about Pakistan, in particular, but
Acumen more generally. Perhaps I should go through the public-private partnerships office?
Re if AID still isn't done, if he'd come in, you might consider whether he should be asked to undertake AID — he'd B6

Good luck with all you're juggling. This has to be a particularly demanding week, in a string of them.

Hi Jan,
I also write to share that I spoke with this morning—he'd called early last week, but we finally connected
today. A real honor to be one of the folks Is seeking out for counsel—and one I don't take lightly! As you
undoubtedly know, he's been offered a new role in the Obama administration, reporting directly to Hillary, would
oversee Of course, I encouraged him to do it (as have most of his students,
and others). In our conversation, he referenced your talking to one another at the Skoll Forum, your describing the
opportunity posed by Hillary's leadership—which would open space for an alliance of visionary leaders to advance a new
development paradigm for engaging with the world.
As I thought about what I said to drawing upon my admiration for what another great social entrepreneur, John
Gardner, contributed in his role as Lyndon Johnson's Secretary of HEW, which gave him a major hand in designing the
Great Society and ushering in that great wave of civil rights legislation—I also wondered about you: specifically, your
World Bank leadership role, and how you were able to leverage your entrepreneurial instincts and clear commitment to
seeing investments translate into on-the-ground change while navigating a very large bureaucracy.
r xpects to be in DC by Thursday, and my gut tells me he is on his way to accepting this extraordinary challenge,
with the goal of reshaping aid policy so that it serves those the U.S. most needs as allies—those billions of women, men
and children the world over whose hearts and minds can be won if they can eat, care for and support their families, find
real reason to hope. My hope, to be perfectly clear!, is that you will be a friend to as he navigates a system he has
challenged and finds ways to drive meaningful, sustainable change. I don't really know, but my sense is that your hand is
already at work here. I also shared with him that you were working on the possibility of Hillary's speaking at next year's
Skoll Forum; he immediately said that Hillary, he and you should go together. How amazing would that be???!!!
Finally, connected with ver Elizabeth Bagley's upcoming visit to the Bay Area; and I
will meet with her when she's out here—if you have any guidance, I'd welcome it: I'm sure you know her and have a
sense of what some possible connections might be.

Global Innovation Fund that invests in "what works" in international development and would complement the work
President Obama is doing with his domestically-focused Social Innovation Fund.
The world needs a new vision for development. This is the moment for experimentation and a new commitment to
innovation and change. The U.S. spent $23.5 billion on foreign assistance in 2006. If we experimented with just $500
million to invest capital and technical assistance in social enterprises focused on results, accountability and scale, we

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05758560 Date: 06/30/2015
could build real blueprints for change. At Acumen Fund we see so many impactful and promising innovations; the State
Department would be a powerful partner in scaling those successes.
A global social innovation fund would be particularly impactful in Pakistan. The U.S. may commit $11.5 billion over five
years to Pakistan, and it is critical that we look closely at how we might spend that money. In Acumen Fund's seven
years working in Pakistan we have found that models for change exist, and we have built a powerful community of
entrepreneurs and supporters within Pakistan. As you know we have invested in organizations like Saiban, which has
provided low-cost housing to more than 60,000. There is FMIA, a joint venture that has sold more than 30,000 health
insurance policies. And Kashf, a microfinance institution serving more than 300,000 poor women by making small loans
to help themselves change their own lives. The challenge is to grow these solutions from reaching hundreds of
thousands to the millions most in need.
I believe this kind of investment in Pakistan is the "smart power" that Secretary Clinton referred to in her speech at the
Global Philanthropy Forum. She has an incredible vision and Acumen Fund would love to find ways to support her.
Anything you could do would be truly appreciated. And do let me know anything I can do on this end as I feel a deep
sense of urgency and want to do all I can to contribute.
Thanks so much,

Frame:
The world we live in today is inextricably interconnected. Together we succeed. Apart we fail. In the Obama
Administration, we will use smart power to advance to our shared security, shared prosperity and shared humanity.
In advancing our shared security, we seek to:
Reduce threat of violent extremism
Reduce the spread of weapons of mass destruction
In advancing our shared prosperity, we seek to:
Use development to create and sustain strong stable economies by:
o Focusing on women as essential for driving economic growth;
o Expanding access to food and the means to grow or buy it; and,
o Expanding access to quality education in developing countries;
Expand access to stable, affordable and increasingly clean energy sources
In advancing our shared humanity, we seek to:
Expand human rights and the conditions that promote respect for human rights

• Support the development of health systems that support healthier societies and confront the spread of pandemic
disease (e.g., AlDs)
How we achieve these goals:
We will advance these goals through shared responsibility and the application of smart power. America has the
responsibility to lead, but can only lead in partnership with others. Smart power means elevating and integrating
diplomacy and development.
DIPLOMACY:
Focus on priority partnerships:
Revitalized partnerships with historic allies EU, Japan, Korea, Australia;
Calibrated partnerships with China and Russia;
Cultivated partnerships: Brazil, India, Turkey, Indonesia, and South Africa;
• Targeted public/private and multilateral partnerships based upon the principles of variable geometry (i.e., focused
on the problem at hand).
Build strong partnerships by:
listening and mutual respect — which has begun already and will continue
• being accountable for the challenges we create and demanding that our partners are similarly accountable;
• focusing on government to people, and people to people connections using new technology to create buy in from
bottom up so shared responsibility is experienced on the ground and sustainable;
• eliminating the obstacles to cooperation that stand in the way of us achieve our goals (e.g., resolving Cyprus so
Turkey can enter the EU; engaging Iran to create greater accountability among EU partners if engagement fails)
• creating work plans to drive cooperation on our shared agenda: tasks, timetables and benchmarks for each
country
DEVELOPMENT:
Establish and implement against our critical priorities:
Women as economic drivers and social stabilizers;
Education as the gateway to economic opportunity and human rights;

Use development to create and sustain strong stable economies by:
o Focusing on women as essential for driving economic growth;
o Expanding access to food and the means to grow or buy it; and,
o Expanding access to quality education in developing countries;
Expand access to stable, affordable and increasingly clean energy sources
In advancing our shared humanity, we seek to:
Expand human rights and the conditions that promote respect for human rights

• Support the development of health systems that support healthier societies and confront the spread of pandemic
disease (e.g., AIDs)
How we achieve these goals:
We will advance these goals through shared responsibility and the application of smart power. America has the
responsibility to lead, but can only lead in partnership with others. Smart power means elevating and integrating
diplomacy and development.
DIPLOMACY:
Focus on priority partnerships:
Revitalized partnerships with historic allies EU, Japan, Korea, Australia;
Calibrated partnerships with China and Russia;
Cultivated partnerships: Brazil, India, Turkey, Indonesia, and South Africa;
• Targeted public/private and multilateral partnerships based upon the principles of variable geometry (i.e., focused
on the problem at hand).
Build strong partnerships by:
listening and mutual respect — which has begun already and will continue
being accountable for the challenges we create and demanding that our partners are similarly accountable;
• focusing on government to people, and people to people connections using new technology to create buy in from
bottom up so shared responsibility is experienced on the ground and sustainable;
• eliminating the obstacles to cooperation that stand in the way of us achieve our goals (e.g., resolving Cyprus so
Turkey can enter the EU; engaging Iran to create greater accountability among EU partners if engagement fails)
creating work plans to drive cooperation on our shared agenda: tasks, timetables and benchmarks for each
country
DEVELOPMENT:
Establish and implement against our critical priorities:
Women as economic drivers and social stabilizers;
Education as the gateway to economic opportunity and human rights;

(SBU) Governor Richardson Interviewed on MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show: Richardson discussed his previous
humanitarian missions to the DPRK to retrieve detained Amcits as well as the current case. He praised the
Administration's handling of the situation so far. In particular, he said that the Secretary had been doing a good job of
emphasizing quiet diplomacy as the way to resolve the matter. Maddow made two inaccurate statements in the
introduction to the segment: 1) that the DPRK has only allowed one consular visit so far; 2) that indictment was
particularly concerning because none of the previous cases had ever gone to court. Richardson corrected the latter
inaccuracy. (EAP/K)

None of these candidates is over 32 years old. The best writer among them is the youngest – 24. She is intellectually
extremely mature and the only professional writer in the group.
On the other hand,
she's extremely smart and an excellent writer.

I have two more candidates who are working on second rounds of mock speeches. I need to see how quickly and
effectively they grasp directions and feedback. Hopefully one of them will work out for us.
One other prospect materialized yesterday; am waiting to get a better feel for her suitability. I'm also re-mining
journalistic contacts to see if I can possibly find a more seasoned writer from a newspaper or magazine who wants to
make the switch to government. So far that has proven futile; the few journalists who I've reached out to were not
interested in coming.
Will keep you posted.

Hilary,
You may know but for the last four years I have been working with the Qatari's and in particular with Sheikha Moser on
disability issues in Qatar and I have built up a good relationship with them
Sheikha Moser has approached me privately saying they are keen to get their relationship with the USA onto a more
positive footing and she was hoping for a "women to women" one to one private meeting with you. She is happy to
come to Washington if you could make some time available.
Is this something you would be prepared o do. Sheikha Moser is someone who has real influence in Qatar and she has
made a lot of difference already with her education city and with the Shaffalah Centre for people with Disabilities in
which I am involved as the Co Chair of its Annual Disability conference. I am sure the conversation would not be
confined to these issues but would be about the US/Qatar relationship generally.

Brian, First, thanks for a nice family morning and for breakfast. Always fun, always interesting and always fulfilling.
Below is a sample of the kind of emails I sent to various people (studio heads; Dan Glickman; etc), which have started to
generate concern, interest and action. AJC is also active on other fronts, as well.
Just below the email you will find the news item which first called this abomination to my attention.
I hope you can enlist Hilary's support (and please give her my personal best). We need, for many reasons, to have the
US protest and condemn this outrageous boycott and to oppose the anti-Semitism inherent in it; cf Durban. The
organizers of the festival must be convinced to reverse themselves. This, because of the inherent wrongness of it and
that if it succeeds, it will encourage and motivate those who fomented the boycott to other, probably even worse,
action. For example, there is in effect or pending (I am not certain which) a UK-Israeli treaty on film production; we
should cut off at the pass any attempts to derail it.

Our Embassy in London does not yet have our Ambassador. The charge d'affaires is Robert Lebaron who I hope will

compare Durban.
This is truly appalling and serious and I earnestly solicit your assistance with the Secretary, and through you my earnest
solicitation of her assistance.
With appreciation and love, Bruce
PS Naturally, you are free to share this email.
Dear Michael, This is disgusting and outrageous.
If you have any films in the festival or can lean on anyone else who does, please get them withdrawn. We would not
boycott the films of any other nation, even those we consider outlaws. Neither should they. And they should learn that
boycotts beget boycotts.
Thanks for whatever help you can be.

Edinburgh film festival bows to pressure from Ken Loach over Israeli boycott
Mike Wade
A row threatened to engulf the Edinburgh International Film Festival yesterday after it bowed to pressure from the
director Ken Loach and returned a £300 grant it had received from the Israeli Embassy.
'Sir Jeremy Isaacs, the former chief executive of Channel Four, accused the festival's organisers of making "an appalling
decision" and called on them to rescind it. Describing Loach's intervention as an act of censorship, he said: "They must
not allow someone who has no real position, no rock to stand on, to interfere with their programming."
The grant was intended to enable Tali Shalom Ezer, a graduate of Tel Aviv University, to travel to Scotland for a
screening of her film, Surrogate.
After days of protest against the award from pro-Palestinian organisations, Loach, an outspoken opponent of Israel's
policies in Lebanon and Gaza, urged filmgoers on Monday to boycott Edinburgh.
"The massacres and state terrorism in Gaza make this money unacceptable," he said. "With regret, I must urge all who
might consider visiting the festival to show their support for the Palestinian nation and stay away."
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05758579 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05758579 Date: 06/30/2015
The intervention brought an immediate capitulation from the organisers. In a statement the festival said it accepted that
Loach spoke "on behalf of the film community, therefore we will be returning the funding issued by the Israeli Embassy".
Sir Jeremy said that he was disgusted both by Loach's actions and by the capitulation of the festival organisers. "Ken
Loach has always been critical of censorship of his own work, albeit it was many years in the past. The idea that he
should lend himself to the denial of a film-maker's right to show her work is absolutely appalling," he said. He was
"equally horrified" that festival organisers should accept that Loach was speaking on behalf of all British film-makers.
Sir Jeremy worked closely with Loach in the 1980s when, as chief executive of Channel Four, he commissioned a number
of controversial documentaries from him. One, A Question of Leadership, was made in 1981 but never broadcast,
leading to accusations of political censorship from Loach. The irony of the director's present position was all the more
obvious, given the spirit of the Edinburgh festival, Sir Jeremy said.
"It must be good for cinemagoers at an international film festival to see films by Jews, Arabs, Israelis and Palestinians, to
the benefit of all," he said.
"I have admired the Edinburgh International Film Festival for many years and would like to think that this appalling
decision will be rescinded."
Loach's acclaimed new film Looking for Eric has made him the toast of the Cannes Film Festival. It is, uncharacteristically,
a comedy, although its lead character is an authentic Loach creation — a Mancunian postman who goes off in search of
his idol, the footballer Eric Cantona.
Ezer's film makes no reference to war or politics. It is a romance set in a sex-therapy clinic. It won the audience award at
an international women's film festival in Israel recently.
Lord Janner of Braunstone, a Labour peer and former chairman of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said that he was
disappointed by the festival's decision. "By banning the Israeli Embassy from supporting a film-maker the festival is
helping to exclude Israelis from British cultural life, something that is clearly unfair."
Last night a spokesman for the EIFF said that although it had returned £300 to the Israeli Embassy, the festival itself
would fund Ms Shalom-Ezer's travel to Edinburgh out of its own budget

Please call me about this if you have a moment. The message is self-explanatory, apparently there is no american voice
in place to speak out or lead on this issue so --there is no voice. I believe you know Bruce Ramer who is my brother-in-

Look forward to seeing you next week in washington. Best, brian

Brian, First, thanks for a nice family morning and for breakfast. Always fun, always interesting and always fulfilling.
Below is a sample of the kind of emails I sent to various people (studio heads; Dan Glickman; etc), which have started to
generate concern, interest and action. AJC is also active on other fronts, as well.
Just below the email you will find the news item which first called this abomination to my attention.
I hope you can enlist Hilary's support (and please give her my personal best). We need, for many reasons, to have the
US protest and condemn this outrageous boycott and to oppose the anti-Semitism inherent in it; cf Durban. The
organizers of the festival must be convinced to reverse themselves. This, because of the inherent wrongness of it and
that if it succeeds, it will encourage and motivate those who fomented the boycott to other, probably even worse,
action. For example, there is in effect or pending (I am not certain which) a UK-Israeli treaty on film production; we
should cut off at the pass any attempts to derail it.
Our Embassy in London does not yet have our Ambassador. The charge d'affaires is Robert Lebaron who I hope will
receive appropriate instructions from DOS. If he acts quickly, it is likely that other nations will follow suit; again,
compare Durban.
This is truly appalling and serious and I earnestly solicit your assistance with the Secretary, and through you my earnest
solicitation of her assistance.
With appreciation and love, Bruce
PS Naturally, you are free to share this email.
Dear Michael, This is disgusting and outrageous.
If you have any films in the festival or can lean on anyone else who does, please get them withdrawn. We would not
boycott the films of any other nation, even those we consider outlaws. Neither should they. And they should learn that
boycotts beget boycotts.
Thanks for whatever help you can be.
Warmest regards. Bruce

Edinburgh film festival bows to pressure from Ken Loach over Israeli boycott

A row threatened to engulf the Edinburgh International Film Festival yesterday after it bowed to pressure from the
director Ken Loach and returned a £300 grant it had received from the Israeli Embassy.
Sir Jeremy Isaacs, the former chief executive of Channel Four, accused the festival's organisers of making "an appalling
decision" and called on them to rescind it. Describing Loach's intervention as an act of censorship, he said: "They must
not allow someone who has no real position, no rock to stand on, to interfere with their programming."
The grant was intended to enable Tali Shalom Ezer, a graduate of Tel Aviv University, to travel to Scotland for a
screening of her film, Surrogate. „
After days of protest against the award from pro-Palestinian organisations, Loach, an outspoken opponent of Israel's
policies in Lebanon and Gaza, urged filmgoers on Monday to boycott Edinburgh.
"The massacres and state terrorism in Gaza make this money unacceptable," he said. "With regret, I must urge all who
might consider visiting the festival to show their support for the Palestinian nation and stay away."
The intervention brought an immediate capitulation from the organisers. In a statement the festival said it accepted that
Loach spoke "on behalf of the film community, therefore we will be returning the funding issued by the Israeli Embassy".
Sir Jeremy said that he was disgusted both by Loach's actions and by the capitulation of the festival organisers. "Ken
Loach has always been critical of censorship of his own work, albeit it was many years in the past. The idea that he
should lend himself to the denial of a film-maker's right to show her work is absolutely appalling," he said. He was
"equally horrified" that festival organisers should accept that Loach was speaking on behalf of all British film-makers.
Sir Jeremy worked closely with Loach in the 1980s when, as chief executive of Channel Four, he commissioned a number
of controversial documentaries from him. One, A Question of Leadership, was made in 1981 but never broadcast,
leading to accusations of political censorship from Loach. The irony of the director's present position was all the more
obvious, given the spirit of the Edinburgh festival, Sir Jeremy said.
"It must be good for cinemagoers at an international film festival to see films by Jews, Arabs, Israelis and Palestinians, to
the benefit of all," he said.
"I have admired the Edinburgh International Film Festival for many years and would like to think that this appalling
decision will be rescinded."
Loach's acclaimed new film Looking for Eric has made him the toast of the Cannes Film Festival. It is, uncharacteristically,
a comedy, although its lead character is an authentic Loach creation — a Mancunian postman who goes off in search of
his idol, the footballer Eric Cantona.
Ezer's film makes no reference to war or politics. It is a romance set in a sex-therapy clinic. It won the audience award at
an international women's film festival in Israel recently.
Lord Janner of Braunstone, a Labour peer and former chairman of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said that he was
disappointed by the festival's decision. "By banning the Israeli Embassy from supporting a film-maker the festival is
helping to exclude Israelis from British cultural life, something that is clearly unfair."
Last night a spokesman for the EIFF said that although it had returned £300 to the Israeli Embassy, the festival itself
would fund Ms Shalom-Ezer's travel to Edinburgh out of its own budget

The Uncommon Trustee
FROM ETHIOPIA TO L.A. WITH $150 IN HIS POCKET, DANIEL YOHANNES BRINGS A QUIET DETERMINATION TO HIS
TRUSTEE ROLE.
By Leah Arroyo
This article was published in Museum, July/August 2008.
Trustee. The word brings to mind a venerable patrician of senior-Nears, "trusted" to guide the interests of an
organization or individual with wisdom and perspective. Someone with old-boy or -girl connections, decades of expertise
and, especially, big bucks—not to mention the ability to pry others away from theirs. Ascot not required, but it couldn't
hurt.
In certain ways, Daniel Yohannes of Denver is not your typical museum trustee. At 17, with $150, he moved from
Ethiopia to Los Angeles as an exchange student without knowing a soul. He immediately got a part-time job as a stock
boy in a clothing store and went on to support himself through high school, Claremont McKenna College and the MBA
program at Pepperdine. He began his banking career as a teller at Security Pacific Bank.
But in other ways, Yohannes is the very portrait of a board member. At 55, the president and CEO of M&R Investments,
a firm specializing in real estate, financial institutions and energy. A former vice chairman of U.S. Bancorp. A few years
ago he started a bank in San Francisco on the side. His board membership extends from the financial (a Fortune 100

company) and educational (U.C. Denver Business School) to community organizations (the chamber of commerce, the
National Jewish Hospital and Research Center, the Boy Scouts Council)—not to mention political service (chairing the
transition team of Gov. Bill Ritter, Democrat of Colorado).
And museums, a priority among the board invitations he has accepted. He served on the Smithsonian Institution's
national board for six years and is now a trustee of the Denver Art Museum (DAM), where he established the Daniel
Yohannes Family African Gallery. "I get a lot of my inspirations intellectually and culturally through art and history,
primarily through museums," he says. "So when I was asked to sit on the [DAM] board, it was just a natural fit for me."
For all his success, though, Yohannes hardly gives the impression of a Type-A personality. Courtly, soft-spoken, with a
melodious accent paying homage to his Ethiopian roots despite his decades in the U.S., he is generous and unhurried
with his time in interviews. On the phone, he asks how you are, what you've been up to lately; told that an interviewer
just bought her first house, he chats for a few moments about how delightful and meaningful that purchase is. In
person, for a conversation at the AAM Annual Meeting in Denver last spring, he walked into a rather dreary
underground room in the convention center, suave in a conservative navy suit and warm in his greetings, politely
oblivious to the tables cluttered with the conference staff's walkie-talkies, office supplies and assortment of snacks. The
photographer got sent to the wrong room and his interviewer had to scurry the length of several football fields to find
her? No problem; he'd reserved plenty of time to talk. "Take your time."
And yet you can at times glimpse the calm determination of a man who gets things done and, moreover, fully expects to.
Vicki Sterling, the Denver Art Museum's assistant director, says that "what was truly unique about working with
[Yohannes] on the African gallery was his ability to bring together people from outside the regular museum donor
community and get them interested in the Denver Art Museum." When you ask him how he did this, who these new
museophiles were, you can almost hear him shrug over the phone. "Friends of mine, people I knew," he says. "They
contributed because I. asked them to." He also shrugs off the question of how he fits all his commitments into his
schedule: "I think as long as there's a desire to get everything done, it gets done." Asked what he does for fun, he has to
think for a moment. "That's a good one.... I walk, I play a little golf, do a little bicycling, sightseeing." He also collects
art, particularly African works, inspired years ago by his travels, though "only as a hobby." Last but not least, he
cherishes spending time with his three children, two of whom live in the area, and was overjoyed to become a
grandfather in May ("She's beautiful," he beams).
You walk away from him with an impression of a quietly dynamic man who has more priorities than most of us but can
somehow bring extraordinary focus to each in turn. He says he was driven from the very beginning. "It was my decision
to come here, not my family's. I've always been a very adventurous person, ever since I was a child, so I made a decision
early on that I wanted to make it on my own. I wanted to go to a place that provided that opportunity for someone like
myself, an immigrant. I could not find any other place but here in the United States that provided all of that
opportunity." Perhaps later generations of his family will be more jaded about the American dream, but Yohannes
speaks of it with unembarrassed directness. "For someone like myself, it's much easier to give to the community that
has given you so much."
Fortunately, he sees museum leadership as part of that obligation.

Subject: Re: FW: Frame
I think this is very good. I really like the emphasis on security, which is part of her brand, and very relevant (I always
have in the back of my mind the possibility that great tragedy will strike again, so we need to prepared to deal with that
reality, should it come about some day).
I like combining that with the notion of prosperity and humanity, which together covers so much ground - from
economic development to human rights.
A couple miscl thoughts --
- in terms of promoting prosperity/economic development, might there be a reason to technological advancement
(giving people access to education and technological tools that can help them in terms of both education and access to
social networks and other avenues for advancement). You do reference education in the development arena, and in
prosperity, so that's good).
- there isn't much here mentioning democratization, freedom, etc. I know that is probably dicey given the multitude of
governments we want to partner with that aren't ready to talk that talk, but still think it needs to be incorporated in
some aspect of a mission statement.
- really like strong reference to women as a key to economic and social stabilization. That ties into her "brand" and into
a reality. I know when the First Ladies of Africa came out here to LA, one of the desires was to try to draw them into an
alliance that might transcend their own national differences and create cross-border force for positive change. A friend

of mine is one of the executives with the Hunger Project, whose CEO is a woman who focuses, too, on the way targeting
women can help alleviate hunger in ways that just dealing with men or generally cannot.
- really like that 'variable geometry' reference. This is kind of like 3 dimensional chess - strange and complicated
alliances need to be made to grapple with a multitude of cross-cutting challenges. This is calculus, not arithmetic.
- would like to be sure religions are involved here, vis a vis the various partnerships. It can be either a powerful force of
positive change, or it can get in the way of progress, depending on how it's used or abused, but to the extent allowed
Constitutionally, the power of religion should be encouraged in the direction of alliances and partnerships of progress.
- as I think about Kennan's "containment" doctrine a little further - in some ways it can be reapplied to extremism,
meaning that our goal should be to contain not Communism this time, but extremist ideology whereever it exists, and
just as Kennan supported, development is one of the ways to build those walls of containment around a dangerous
ideology. We want to contain extremist, nihilistic, violent ideologies and movements whereever they might take root,
and a good way to do that is to focus on development, on women, on technology, on education.
The power of diplomacy rests on two foundations. On the one hand, there is the reality and potentiality of military
force. Without having the capacity to defend, and to project force, diplomacy is inherently weak and ineffectual.
On the other hand, development is the other foundation upon which successful diplomacy can be built. It's the carrot to
the military's stick. And the State Department has an integral role to play in both the diplomatic and developmental
parts of that tripod (while also being understanding of, and when necessary supportive of, implementing the military
part).
The connective tissue of security, prosperity and humanity is, as you suggest, "purpose," or more prosaically -
"morality." Morals. It is immoral for people to live in fear, to be unprotected, to be subject to harm and death. It is
immoral for people's human rights to be violated, to not have access to education and heatlh. And it is immoral to be
denied the opportunity to grow, to create a better future for children, etc. To let, as Roy has said, every child to live up
to his or her God-given potential.
one last point - on shared humanity, perhaps protecting the natural resources of the Earth - environmentalism - should
be referenced along with health and human rights. It's part of the underpinning of our international morality and the
kind of partnership we need to solve global warming, etc.

to fill out a raft of background forms (one involves listing all the foreign nationals a candidate encountered over a period

Subject: Huff Post Renegade Excerpt
Of all his transition choices, none was easier to make, or more complex to execute, than Hillary Clinton as secretary of
state. Obama had long wanted his former rival on his team, no matter what his friends and aides said about her
aggressive campaign... His staff opposed the idea for the most part, arguing that Clinton would never be truly loyal. But
Obama was willing to leave the primaries behind, including his own strong feelings at the time. "I don't hold grudges,"
he told his aides. "I don't worry about the past. I'm concerned about what happens now. If she can help me and Bill
Clinton isn't too much of a liability, we should seriously look at this." ...
Obama was under no illusion about the legacy of the long primary season. During one transition meeting, Obama said he
wanted to offer Clinton the diplomatic job. "I'm really interested in pursuing this, but I know she has some hard feelings
coming out of this campaign." Emanuel and John Podesta, the former Clinton official who ran the transition, assured
Obama that she was over those hard feelings now. Obama smiled and said, "Believe me. She's not over it yet."
His decision to offer her the job of secretary of state came surprisingly early. Well before the end of the primaries, when
his staff and friends still felt hostile to her, Obama decided that Clinton possessed the qualities to carry his diplomacy to
the rest of the world. "We actually thought during the primary, when we were pretty sure we were going to win, that
she could end up being a very effective secretary of state," he told me later. "I felt that she was disciplined, that she was
precise, that she was smart as a whip, and that she would present a really strong image to the world...I had that mapped
out."
Recruiting and managing a team of rivals would not be easy, and Clinton came with her own set of issues. Chief among
them was her campaign debt, which she wanted eliminated before she took the job of secretary of state. Would the
president-elect go out and help her to do so? "I'm not begging her to take this job," Obama told his senior aides. "If she
•wants it, I could help. But I'm not willing to go out in these difficult economic times to do a flashy fundraiser in
California." As it happened, plenty of people in the Senate were begging Obama to offer Clinton the job. Obama's aides

believed that many Senate Democrats thought Clinton had extended her presidential campaign far beyond the point
where she had lost the election. Her negative advertising wasted Democratic money, threatened to undermine the
party's nominee, and suggested that she was disloyal to the party. They were unwilling to offer the junior New York
senator a position ahead of her lowly rank, and she stood little chance of becoming majority leader. "There was a lot of
encouragement from inside the Senate to get her into this job," said one senior Obama aide. "They wanted her out of
there." ...
As for controlling the uncontrollable Bill Clinton, Obama's aides drew up a series of checks on his fundraising for both
Clinton Global Initiative and his work on HIV/AIDS across the world. But they really counted on Hillary to be the ultimate
safeguard - against both her husband and her own ambition. "It's in her interests to keep him in line," warned one senior
Obama aide. Others in Obama's inner circle said the president-elect believed Clinton needed to demonstrate that she
was a team player and to shape her own career and legacy. "There are plenty who don't trust her and think she still
harbors something," said another senior adviser. "It's still potentially problematic down the road. Barack's thinking on
this is that it's not in her interests to mess with us. She can't win that fight internally and she's smart enough that she
won't want that fight publicly."
Several weeks into the administration, even Clinton's internal critics believed the relationship was a success. "They have
both worked really hard at it," said one senior White House official. "There's a natural affinity and respect that ironically
grew out of being opponents. You get to know someone really well after all that."

conference that is being held in Demark on 3-4 December 2009.
We have made the note reasonably in-depth so hopefully will provide you with sufficient background. The organisers of
the event which are ATP - the largest Danish Pension Fund and the Climate Consortium Denmark are being sponsored
and backed by the Danish government and they were very hopeful that Hillary would be able to be the key note speaker
at the conference for reasons that they have identified in the attached briefing document.
We were hoping to establish whether this event would be of interest for Hillary to appear and if she was available we
would then arrange for the formal invite to be sent out by the Danish Government.
If we can provide any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.
With very Best wishes
Nigel

Sorry to flood your email, but I couldn't resist sending this to you from Ben Smith.
A year later, Hillary wins
A year ago today, the final set of primaries made official the foregone conclusion that Barack Obama had won the
primary, and Hillary Clinton lost it.
There's far too much going on today to dwell on an anniversary, but it does seem worth noting one particular piece of
news in its light: On the central health care policy debate of the Democratic Primary -- which was, to be fair, conducted
within a fairly narrow frame -- Obama appears to have conceded today to a Senate plan likely to more closely resemble
Clinton's.
In a dense, careful letter <http://www.politico.com/static/PPM118_090603_healthcare_ltr.html> to Ted Kennedy nd
Max Baucus, Obama offered his principles <http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0609/23298.html> for a health care
plan and conceded on a central point: He is now open to an individual mandate, which he campaigned against, and
which is now being talked about by Senators of both parties with the buzzword "shared responsibility."
Obama still backs a "hardship waiver" for people unable to afford the mandate -- which is consistent with the core of his
objection to the mandate. But what he cast as a principled difference of approach -- was the problem merely that
people couldn't afford insurance? or something more? -- seems to have been conceded.
Here's the relevant paragraph:
I understand the Committees are moving towards a principle of shared responsibility -- making every American
responsible for having health insurance coverage, and asking that employers share in the cost. I share the goal of ending
lapses and gaps in coverage that make us less healthy and drive up everyone's costs, and I am open to your ideas on
shared responsibility. But I believe if we are going to make people responsible for owning health insurance, we must
make health care affordable. If we do end up with a system where people are responsible for their own insurance, we

need to provide a hardship waiver to exempt Americans who cannot afford it. In addition, while I believe that employers
have a responsibility to support health insurance for their employees, small businesses face a number of special
challenges in affording health benefits and should be exempted.

CONCEPT NOTE FOR WORLD FOOD PRIZE CEREMONY
Thursday, June 11, 2009
This speech is an opportunity to signal the urgency of the problem of global hunger; connect it to an array of global
issues, including economic development, health and education, expanding opportunity for women, and political
stability; and declare the Administration's commitment to tackling hunger at its roots, through effective and efficient
collaboration with an array of partners.
Additionally, your remarks can point to a shift from past approaches by emphasizing the need to support local solutions
and focus on long-term sustainability to help people feed themselves and reduce the need for emergency assistance
down the road.
The speech could be framed as follows:
THE PRIZE AND PRIZE-WINNER
You can begin by announcing the winner of the 2009 World Food Prize, Dr. Gebisa Ejeta. He has a remarkable story:
born in a mud hut in Ethiopia, he got his PhD from Purdue University in plant breeding and genetics and developed
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05758705 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05758705 Date: 06/30/2015
strains of sorghum that are drought-tolerant, high-yield, and resistant to the Striga weed, which devastates crops across
Africa.
Outside the lab, he helped start the Sudanese commercial seed industry; developed systems to produce, certify, and
market hybrid seeds; and educated farmers about the use of fertilizers and soil and water conservation. And he has
trained and inspired the next generation of African agricultural scientists.
A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH: FROM LAB TO FARM TO MARKET TO TABLE
Dr. Ejeta's work reflects the breadth of this issue and the comprehensive approach needed to address it—one that
connects the labs where new seed technologies are developed.., the fields where small-scale farmers labor to feed their
families and make a living.., the markets where food is bought and sold... and the homes where people get the
nourishment they need to thrive.
In many places, that food chain is broken. One billion people worldwide woke up hungry this morning and will go to
sleep hungry tonight. Chronic hunger threatens health, while making it harder for people to work and students to learn,
which in turn stunts economic development. Last year's food riots demonstrated that when food is scarce, political
stability is threatened.
To date, the world's primary response to hunger has been to send emergency food aid. While this saves lives, it is a
short-term fix, and we need a long-term solution.
The Obama Administration is committed to leading in developing a new global approach. We will support the creation
of sustainable agricultural systems in appropriate regions around the world, to increase agricultural productivity, create
jobs, strengthen economies, and protect natural resources.
We will do this not by imposing one-size-fits-all solutions, but by assisting countries in carrying out individual strategies
that meet their needs—for example, through the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Plan. To facilitate
coordination and share best practices, we will seek to convene donor governments, multilateral institutions, NG0s,
private companies, foundations, universities, and individuals.
THE ANCHORS OF OUR APPROACH
We've identified seven anchors that secure sustainable agriculture systems. These will guide our approach.
• Increase agricultural productivity by expanding access to quality seeds, fertilizer, irrigation, the credit to purchase
them, and the training to use them.
• Stimulate the post-harvest sector by improving the storage and processing of food and improving transportation to
connect small farmers to markets.
• Maintain natural resources so the land can be farmed well into the future and we can make the right adaptations
for the changing environment.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05758705 Date: 06/30/2015
Expand knowledge and training by support R&D and developing the next generation of agriculture scientists.
Increase trade so small-scale farmers in developing countries can sell their crops far and wide.
• Support policy reform and good governance, because sustainable agriculture flourishes in a,clear and predictable
policy and regulatory environment.
• Support women and families in agriculture. Seventy percent of the world's farmers are women, but most of the
programs that offer credit and training to farmers target men. This must change for agriculture to thrive. And children
must have nutrition to contribute to their communities' future.
A PREVIEW OF WHAT'S TO COME
In the coming weeks, President Obama, Secretary Vilsack and I will be reaching out to share our approach to global
coordination and agriculture in greater detail. We will seek the input, wisdom and guidance of those who have been
working so long in this arena—from the Congress to NGOs to academics to foundations to the private sector. The
President's conversations at the G-8 meeting in Italy in two weeks will address our approach, as well as my trip to Africa
in August.
Addressing hunger and food is essential to achieving economic recovery, stabilizing societies, and expanding opportunity
for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. This is why supporting sustainable agriculture worldwide will be a central
element of foreign policy in the Obama Administration.
CONCLUSION
You can circle back to the story of Dr. Ejeta to close. He represents the need for a multinational approach: born in
Ethiopia, educated in the United States, advised by Indian scientists, advisor to several African nations.

National Security Threats Posed by Climate Change and Our Dependence on Foreign Oil
Dear,
I've spent my entire life working to keep America safe. That is why I feel compelled to add my voice to the growing
number of senior U.S. generals, admirals, and veterans calling for immediate actions to address the alarming national
security threats posed by climate change and our dependence on foreign oil.
We import over half our oil from countries that are hostile to us. Last year, we paid over $255 BILLION to Middle
Eastern countries that are the primary funders for terrorists groups like Al Qaeda and to Russia and Venezuela.
The U.S. consumes more energy than any other country in the world, so increased U.S. fuel efficiency standards and
reliance on renewable energy will directly affect not only our own economic prosperity, but world energy prices as well.
That matters because when the cost of a barrel of crude oil increases $10, the Ayatollah Khamenei in Iran gets $15
billion more, Putin in Russia gets an extra $36 billion, and Hugo Chavez in Venezuela gets an additional $10 billion to
prop up his anti-American regime.
Furthermore, since the military is the largest energy consumer in the U.S., that same $10/barrel increase means DoD has
to spend $1.3 billion more on fuel, which is equal to the entire procurement budget for the Marine Corps.
But our reliance on foreign oil does more than fund our enemies. The droughts, famines, and rising sea levels caused by
climate change pose perhaps the greatest destabilizing influence the world will face over the next 50 years.
Forty percent of the world's population gets its drinking water from mountain glaciers that could disappear within
decades. Without forceful and decisive action, conflict will likely erupt among climate refugees competing for dwindling
resources and political destabilization will create ungoverned spaces where terrorists can flourish. These effects were
seen in Afghanistan in the 1990s and are currently being experienced in Somalia and Darfur, were genocide erupted
following the drying of Lake Chad, leaving 300,000 dead.
We must act now. A huge coalition of faith and military leaders have joined together to support efforts in Congress to
pass effective climate change legislation this year. We need you to add your voice to ours by taking 1 minute to
encourage your Member of Congress to support this effort. Please click here to email or call your Representative.

Was going to write earlier re Palau willingness to take the 17 Guantanamo Uighurs -- but see the story has now
broken. I am now representing Palau, primarily re extension of free association w/ the U.S. In touch w/Fried's office re
Uighurs. Big commitment for Palau since Chinese tourism was planned and its close geographically, etc. but their
premium is on U.S. relations (as sadly demonstrated by the loss of a Palauan in the U.S. Army in Afghanistan last week).
Also, just FYI now, I've been concerned that the Budget includes a far too low placeholder for free association
extension aid, $45-9 m over 10 years, although the aid is to be based on a joint review of need that will really begin with
a Palauan presentation Friday. (I think the number didn't reflect any rethinking by this Administration). The U.S. is to
respond in a month.

Kyrgyzstan rejects Obama "cooperation" offer
U.S. President Obama has sent a personal appeal to Kyrgyzstan proposing ways to discuss "expanding cooperation".
Kyrgyzstan will not reverse its decision to close a U.S. military air base which is used to supply American troops for
Afghanistan occupation, Kyrgyz Foreign Minister Kadyrbek Sarbayev said on Thursday. U.S. President Barack Obama has
sent a personal appeal to Kyrgyzstan proposing ways to discuss "expanding cooperation".
But Bakiyev's office said in a statement it had received a letter from Obama praising bilateral relations. "Moreover,
Barack Obama expressed hope to further strengthen various forms of cooperation between the United States and
Kyrgyzstan," the statement said without mentioning the air base issue. "The decision to annul all agreements on the
Manas military air base has been taken and there is no turning back on this," he told the 24.kg news agency.

Most interesting observation of the day, from
"A statistical analysis of the data issued by the ministry of interior suggests a perfect linear relationship between votes
received by Ahmadinejad and Mousavi with an r-squared value of 0.9995, a near impossibility in nature.This suggests
that the ballots were never counted or were abandoned after it was clear Ahmadinejad was going to lose. Statistically, it
is impossible to maintain such a perfect linear relationship consistently through all stages of vote counting. We would
expect variation as the votes were coming in, due to differences expected between the cites and the country side and
hetereogeneity amoung ethnic groups.This to me is the most concrete evidence I have seen"

The Settlements Facts
By Daniel Kurtzer
Sunday, June 14, 2009
Faulty analysis of the Israeli settlement issue is being passed off as fact. Charles Krauthammer's June 5 column, "The
Settlements Myth <http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/04/AR2009060403811.html> ,"
is one example.
Here are the facts: In 2003, the Israeli government accepted, with some reservations, the "road map" for peace, which
imposed two requirements on Israel regarding settlements: "GOI [Government of Israel] immediately dismantles
settlement outposts erected since March 2001. Consistent with the Mitchell Report, GOI freezes all settlement activity
(including natural growth of settlements)."
Today, Israel maintains that three events -- namely, draft understandings discussed in 2003 between Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon and U.S. deputy national security adviser Stephen Hadley; President George W. Bush's April 14, 2004, letter
to Sharon; and an April 14 letter from Sharon adviser Dov Weissglas to national security adviser Condoleezza Rice --
constitute a formal understanding in which the United States accepted continuing Israeli building within the
"construction line" of settlements. The problem is that there was no such understanding.
The first event the Israelis cite is the 2003 discussions on a four-part draft that included the notion that construction
within settlements might be permitted if confined to the already built-up areas of the settlements. The idea was to draw
a line around the outer perimeter of built-up areas in settlements and to allow building only inside that line. This draft
was never codified, and no effort was made then to define the line around the built-up areas of settlements.

Nonetheless, Israel began to act largely in accordance with its own reading of these provisions, probably believing that
U.S. silence conferred assent.
Second, President Bush's 2004 letter conveyed U.S. support of an agreed outcome of negotiations in which Israel would
retain "existing major Israeli population centers" in the West Bank "on the basis of mutually agreed changes ...." One
of the key provisions of this letter was that U.S. support for Israel's retaining some settlements was predicated on there
being an "agreed outcome" of negotiations. Despite Israel's contention that this letter allowed it to continue building in
the large settlement blocs of Ariel, Maale Adumim and Gush Etzion, the letter did not convey any U.S. support for or
understanding of Israeli settlement activities in these or other areas in the run-up to a peace agreement.
In his 2004 letter to Rice, Weissglas addressed the issue of the "construction line," saying that "within the agreed
principles of settlement activities, an effort will be made in the next few days to have a better definition of the
construction line of settlements in Judea & Samaria." However, there never were any "agreed principles of settlement
activities." Moreover, the effort to define the "construction line" was never consummated: Israel and the United States
discussed briefly but did not reach agreement on the definition of the construction line of settlements. Weissglas's letter
also promised "continuous action" to remove all the unauthorized outposts, but Israel removed almost none of them.
Throughout this period, the Bush administration did not regularly protest Israel's continuing settlement activity. But this
is very different from arguing that the United States agreed with it. In recent days, former senior Bush administration
officials have told journalists on background that no understandings existed with Israel regarding continued settlement
activity.
Commentators also focus on the Obama administration's reiteration that a freeze must include the "natural growth" of
settlements. Krauthammer says that this "means strangling to death the thriving towns close to the 1949 armistice line.
.. It means no increase in population. Which means no babies." This is nonsense. No one suggests that Israelis stop
having babies. Rather, the blessing of a new baby does not translate into a right to build more apartments or houses in
settlements. The two issues have nothing to do with each other. Israelis, like Americans, move all the time when life
circumstances -- children, jobs, housing availability -- change.
The pattern of population growth in the territories actually undercuts the natural-growth argument. Since 1993, when
Israel signed the Oslo Accords, Israel's West Bank settler population has grown from 116,300 to 289,600. The numbers in
East Jerusalem increased from 152,800 to more than 186,000. This goes far beyond the natural increase of families
already living in the settlements. Inserting the provision of "natural growth" in official documents started with the 2001
Mitchell Report and the 2003 "road map," reflecting recognition that the concept was being abused as a justification for
expanding settlements. The Obama administration is pursuing policies that every administration since 1967 has
articulated -- that settlements jeopardize the possibility of achieving peace and thus settlement activity should stop. This
does not diminish the Palestinians' responsibilities, especially their commitment to stop violence and terrorism and
uproot terrorist infrastructure. President Obama emphasized this in his Cairo speech. But Palestinian failures in no way
justify Israeli failure to implement their road map commitments with respect to settlements and outposts. It is time for
Israel to freeze all settlement activity and dismantle the unauthorized outposts.

University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.

would like to state that based on conversations that took place in the intervening time period between Ambassador
Eizenstat and the leadership of the HSF, and the commitments he made to our leaders, we are no longer asking that he
be replaced as the head of the U.S. delegation to the Prague Conference taking place on June 26-30.
On behalf of all of the survivors for whom we have been fighting over the last decade, including tens of thousands in
desperate need, we wish Ambassador Eizenstat the best of success as the head of the United States delegation at the
Conference, as well as in the follow-up activities that we understand will occur on matters affecting Holocaust survivors'
rights and interests.
Sincerely,

restores democratic order.
- We appreciate the role Spain played in winning quick EU condemnation of the coup attempt.
- Our work is not done. Rebuilding trust among competing political institutions and reducing polarization within
Honduras will take a lot of work. We hope Spain will work with us and the OAS to ensure a restoration of democratic
order that will allow Honduras to carry through with it electoral timetable (presidential vote scheduled for November)
Note from tom:
Aside from the statements issued by the President and the Secretary, we have been working in the OAS Permanent
Council fashioning a consensus resolution mapping out a path forward, reaching out to regional partners ( I have spoken
twice with Salvadoran President Funes, and our Ambassadors have been working with other Central American leaders),
and working within Honduras to limit the damage to Honduras institutions.

10 received and disseminated the draft Honduras GA resolution, which Honduras has asked us to co-sponsor, this
evening. President Zelaya addresses the General Assembly tomorrow morning at 11:00 am, so USUN needs to be
instructed this evening.
The bureaus are happy to co-sponsor, as long as the resolution stays substantively the same. The draft text is below:

DRAFT RESOLUTION UNDER ITEM 20 OF THE AGENDA: CONCERNING THE SITUATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND
PROGRESS TOWARD A REGION OF PEACE, DEMOCRACY AND DEVELOPMENT
The General Assembly, concerned by the political and social events since June 28, 2009 in the Republic of Honduras;
Recalling the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter, the OAS Charter, and the Inter-American
Democratic Charter;
Deeply concerned by the unconstitutional alteration of the democratic order, which has endangered security,
democracy and rule of law, and jeopardized the safety of Honduran citizens and foreigners;
1. Condemns the breaking of constitutional order in Honduras and the overthrow of the democratically elected
President Don Jose Manuel Zelaya Rosales,
2. Demands the restoration of President Jose Manuel Zelaya Rosales to his constitutional duties so that he may fulfill
the mandate for which he was elected by the Honduran population,

Thanks for your good wishes. I am finally on the mend and starting physical therapy. One word of advice--watch where
you step!
I was very excited by the announced merger w Sandy's firm which sounds like a win-win for all.
I miss seeing you and hope we can remedy that soon. Happy 4th!

TEGUCIGALPA, June 30 (Reuters) - An interim government set up after a military coup in Honduras said it will send a
delegation of politicians, business leaders and lawyers to Washington on Wednesday for talks on the crisis.
Roberto Micheletti, sworn in as caretaker president after leftist President Manuel Zelaya was toppled by the army on
Sunday, announced the mission after Zelaya traveled to New York and Washington to address the United Nations and
Organization of American States.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Congressman Henry Waxman, the powerful chairman the U.S. House of Representatives Energy
and Commerce Committee, has been hospitalized in Los Angeles for an undisclosed ailment, a spokeswoman said. The
69-year-old veteran Democrat from Southern California was not feeling well on Tuesday and was admitted to Cedars-
Sinai Medical Center for "routine testing," the spokeswoman, Karen Lightfoot said. "He's feeling much better now,"
Lightfoot said. She declined to disclose the nature of his ailment or how long he is expected to remain in the hospital.
Waxman, a member of Congress since 1975, was a leading co-sponsor of landmark climate change legislation passed by
the House on Friday.

Isn't a surprise since 5 years ago he removed his brother as official crown prince.
Basically he's not honoring his fathers dying wish but since constitution says it should be son (with brother as option) he
has clear authority to do it. I personally think this shows confidence in his position as he's not worried about an outcry
from his fathers loyalists.

The OASGA still has not started. The Argentine President has arrived, but Zelaya has not.
I am working this event from my home. We have Hector B6
Morales, Craig Kelly, and Dan Restrepo at OAS Headquarters.
As I noted earlier, we will almost certainly have a resolution that suspends Honduras. There has been some talk about
using the resolution to urge countries to impose economic sanctions. Honduras (Zelaya government) finally said no to
that.
We are also working to convince Zelaya that now is not the time to return to Honduras. We are trying to get Insulza to
talk with the Argentine president about this. Hector spoke with the Dominican president earlier in the day, who is also
weighing in on the side of sanity.
That is all for the moment. This will probably go very late.

Zelaya seems intent on returning. If no other presidents travel with him, Insulza feels under an obligation to
accompany.

Zelaya seems intent on returning. If no other presidents travel with him, Insulza feels under an obligation to
accompany.

They are now saying that Zelaya doesn't want to travel tomorrow because wants to participate (remotely) in the burial
ceremony on Monday for those who died in violence at the airport today. He said he will return to Washington on
Tuesday in time to meet in the late afternoon. They are asking if it would be possible to have the meeting sometime on
Tuesday late afternoon instead.

Sorry for the late email, but Central America Office Director Christopher Webster just called me to inquire about a
possible meeting between Zelaya and the Secretary tomorrow. He said they are trying to convince Zelaya to return from
San Salvador to the U.S. and that A/S Shannon indicated the Secretary had said that she would be willing to meet with
him tomorrow. They were wondering if they could give Zelaya a window of time for a meeting (see email below from
DCM in Sal Salvador). Please advise.

At 1945, local NIC media aired footage from MGA airport of Zelaya getting back on plane. It appeared that FM Rodas
and Ven FM Maduro were also in departing party.
NIC president Ortega put Z on plane at airport, but did not go with him.
Footage was recent, if not live, perhaps no more than 20 minutes old.

Looping other members of SITREP spam -- Managua understands that plane with ousted HOND President Zelaya left
WDC at approx 1500 WDC time. Also understand that plane is expected in Managua at approx 1924 local. Understand
that a separate plane with Argentine Pres Kirchner and Ecuadorian Pres. Correa also left WDC this afternoon en route to
El Salvador.
NEW INFORMATION
About 45 minutes ago, Telesur had images of apparent pro-Zelaya supporters at the airport fence and trying to pull it
down. Security forces inside the airport compound re-deployed to prevent a breach. It seems they did use white smoke
or gas to deter protestor action. Telesur also reported that shots were fired into the assembled crowd and that one or
two people were shot and killed (no names or confirmation). Images of ambulances in crowd were visible.
It seems now that the fence has been breached and a handful of pro-Zelaya supporters move in and out of airport area
to pick up rocks and retreat (there is open, clear area inside fence, possible construction). Security forces have taken up
positions on tarmac, presumably to prevent further incursion.

With respect to Micheleti assertion that NIC troops have mobilized near the border, our NIC contacts, both in GON and
private citizens indicate that there has been NO/NO unusual NIC mil activity at border -- Las Manos or El Espino.
However, as of 1900 Saturday, border contacts at El Espino report that HOND military reinforced its presence by about
70 personnel, who remain at El Espino. We were told this happened at Las Manos as well, but have not yet been able to
confirm with our sources at that border location.

Saddam's rule 'better' for gay Iraqis
Investigating reports of the murder and torture of gay men in Iraq, Ashley Byrne found that some gays found Saddam
Hussein's dictatorship preferable to the threat of violence they face today. Some readers will find parts of his report
disturbing.
There has been so much news of death and destruction from Iraq that the position of sexual minorities is rarely touched
on in the mainstream media.
But stories of torture and murder of gay Iraqis, particularly men, have been emerging in the gay press for several years.
Investigating these stories for a BBC Radio 5 Live documentary, Gay Life After Saddam, I've heard a range of views about
the deteriorating conditions for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) people.
Some say the violence has intensified in the past few months. Others say killings run into the hundreds and have been
going on since 2003.

What is clear, and confirmed by separate evidence from various human rights groups, is that some gay men have been
subjected to appalling violent abuse.
One young Iraqi, Amil (not his real name) recalled the death of a friend: "They found out he was gay and they killed him
and they chopped him like a lamb, it was awful."
Another man (who wished to remain anonymous) revealed to Scott Long from the New York-based Human Rights
Watch, how his partner was kidnapped and killed.
"It was late one night when four armed men came to take my boyfriend from his parents' house.
" They found out he was gay and they killed him and they chopped him like a Iamb"
Amil, a gay Iraqi
"They were masked and dressed in black.
"We found his body the next day dumped in the garbage, his throat cut out, his genitals cut off."
Of all the shocking testimony we heard, a form of torture involving glue has to be the most awful revelation to emerge
from our investigations.
Human Rights Watch researcher Rasha Moumneh told us: "We've heard stories of gay-specific torture where men have
glue in their anuses and they force-feed them laxatives."
Gay men inside Iraq have been able to seek sanctuary in safe houses, thanks to the UK-based Iraqi Lesbian Gay Bisexual
and Transgender (LGBT) group, which manages them from London.
The documentary team were granted exclusive access to one of the homes on the outskirts of Baghdad, where we found
a 31-year-old transsexual man called Qasim (not his real name).
Qasim said: "I'm scared all the time. I often think people are going to come in the night and take me because I am
particularly known as gay."
All the LGBT Iraqis interviewed for Gay Life After Saddam maintained that life was easier for them when Saddam Hussein
was in power, from 1979 to 2003.
Some spoke fondly of an underground gay culture that flourished before the war in Baghdad.
But it was unclear exactly what Saddam's view on homosexuality was, and there has been some evidence to suggest that
the former dictator was acting to clamp down on sexual minorities in the latter years of his reign.
So who is to blame for the violence against LGBT people in Iraq?
Some blame militia, while other accuse religious leaders of stoking up hatred of homosexuals, though some clerics have
also recently condemned the attacks on gays.
The Iraqi government and police also deny that there have been any state-sanctioned killings or torture of homosexuals
in Iraq.
What is clear however is that gay people in Iraq have not been crushed.
He may be holed up in a safe house but Qasim is hopeful: "I find the Iraqi prime minister quite good.

"I hope he can talk with religious leaders, change the constitution and punish and imprison the murderers."
Meanwhile the refugee who runs the safe houses from London, Ali HiIli, lives in constant fear of his life after being sent
two fatwas, or Islamic religious rulings.
But he has insisted he will not give up trying to help gay people in Iraq.
"If I think too much that someone is going to get me and kill me then I know I'd stop what I'm doing.
"I have to continue because I really believe in the work that I am doing."
Gay Life After Saddam was broadcast on Radio 5 Live, Sunday 5 July.

My guess is that he is calling about Honduras. He, like many other leaders with an interest in Central America, is worried
that Honduras is slipping towards confrontation and violence. He probably does not think Insulza is up to the task. S
should be aware that Arias is prepared to offer his services. I spoke with the Costa Rican FonMin, who said the de facto
government has reached out to Arias, and that the Costa Ricans will be looking for a way to make the offer to Zelaya.
Uribe knows Zelaya and has some influence. Uribe might want to talk with Arias and offer to help move Zelaya in the
right direction. (Although Uribe and Zelaya come from different ends of the political spectrum, they are both ranchers
and love horses, and this has created some comradeship.)

A US Expo 2010 pavilion, after all. <http://shanghaiscrap.com/?p=3350>
http://shanghaiscrap.com/?p=3350
Filed under:Expo 2010 <http://shanghaiscrap.com/?cat=33>, Expo 2010 - US Pavilion
<http://shanghaiscrap.com/?cat=38>, US Politics <http://shanghaiscrap.com/?cat=28> — posted by Adam on July 11,
2009 @ 7:00 am
Coming at the end of a tumultuous week in China marked by earthquakes, riots, and continued economic uncertainty,
the news that the US had finally confirmed that its participation in Expo 2010
<http://en.expo2010.cn/a/20090710/000011.htm> (a/k/a, next year's world fair) didn't seem particularly significant.
And, with much of Shanghai's foreign correspondent corps preoccupied with more pressing news elsewhere in China, it
didn't receive much coverage. Fair enough, I think. However, insofar as the US pavilion – or lack thereof– had become
an increasingly thorny diplomatic issue between China and the United States, the signing ceremony was an important
signal that some kind of resolution was at hand.
I've been following the mostly sad saga of the US pavilion for several months now, both on Shanghai Scrap
<http://shanghaiscrap.com/?cat=38>, and elsewhere <http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200904u/shanghai-expo-2010>
. And, until two weeks ago, there was absolutely no reason to believe that a participation agreement would ever be
signed. Shanghai Expo, Inc. <http://usapavilion2010.comh , a non-profit authorized by the US State Department to
fund-raise, design, build, and operate a US pavilion, had failed to raise sufficient funds to break ground. At yesterday's
signing ceremony, Beatrice Camp, the US Consul General in Shanghai blamed the underwhelming fundraising on the
global economic crisis <http://shanghai.usembassy-china.org.cn/071009.html> – a point that was picked up by the
Chinese media <http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-07/10/content_11685418.htm> . No doubt, the economic
crisis played a role, but as Camp and others close to the US effort surely know, the other important factor was the
inexperienced and increasingly erratic trio running the non-profit Shanghai Expo, Inc. As recently as last month, one of
its members – Frank Lavin, a former US ambassador to Singapore and Undersecretary of Commerce – issued a press
release falsely claiming that the US Congress had "adopted" a resolution in support of the US pavilion
<http://shanghaiscrap.com/?p=3106> . This incident, and others like it, succeeded in alienating potential donors
(including major US corporations with operations in China), vast swaths of the US expatriate business community in
Shanghai, and – most crucially – members of the Shanghai government. For those of us following the events, the
question was no longer "How badly will the US damage its relationship with China if it doesn't participate?" but instead
became "What's worse for US-China relations? Turning down Shanghai's Expo invite or continuing the current,
incompetent effort?"
The July 1 appointment of Jose Villarreal as Commissioner General to the US pavilion effort seems to have changed the
equation. A lawyer with ties to the Clintons, Secretary of State Clinton empowered him to oversee the US effort. He
didn't waste any time, either, arriving in Shanghai on Monday, and managing to pull of the signing on Friday. One person
familiar with Villarreal's role described it as the arrival of an "adult" to a chaotic situation that badly needed one. Indeed,
if there's one telling detail to the handful of official and press accounts of yesterday's signing, it's the total absence of
the Shanghai Expo, Inc. members from the official comments and photos (US Consulate coverage here
<http://en.expo2010.cn/a/20090710/000011.htm> ; Shanghai government account here
<http://en.expo2010.cn/a/20090710/000011.htm> ), none of whom live or work in Shanghai, anyway. If that was a
conscious decision, it was a wise one.
A final point. As Villarreal conceded, the US effort must still raise roughly half of its $61 million budget. I suspect that –
with Villarreal in charge of the effort – reluctant wallets will become less so. Regardless, though, this raises a still
unresolved question: namely, what are the actual fundraising rules for the US pavilion effort? Back in 2007, the State
Department indicated that it would not sign a participation agreement with Expo 2010, Inc until all funds were raised for
a pavilion. Apparently, that ill-conceived policy has changed. I say apparently because, up until now, the State
Department has refused to release the "action plan" that governs fundraising and other rules related to the US pavilion
in Shanghai. As a result of this official intransigence, a Freedom of Information Act request has been filed to obtain this

Department's FOIA office, we can keep guessing until Thanksgiving — it's around then that they'll get around to releasing
the documents.

Subject: Palau offended by US positions
Below is the statement of very impressive Palau reps at the end of a session of required meetings on the next phase of
free association aid. FYI only, the Palauans were insulted by the nature and depth of the response to their proposal as
well as the content and the overall approach. They are even privately questioning the relationship. (This hasn't affected
their intent to take the Uighurs.) I will send a few further thoughts.
At the conclusion of yesterday's meeting, the Palau delegation caucused to discuss its reaction to the response of the
United States delegation to the proposals that it made in June in Washington D.C., and expanded upon in subsequent
communications.
While the Palau delegation has agreed to respond to certain additional questions raised by the United States delegation
on specific elements of the Palau proposal, and further has agreed to participate in certain working groups on specific
issues, the Palau delegation was deeply disappointed with the response of the United States delegation. The United
States delegation did not seriously respond, as required by the Compact, to the operational requirements of the
Government of Palau or to Palau's comprehensive and considered plans to achieve economic advancement and self-
sufficiency.
In light of the foregoing, the Palau delegation has determined that it must now return to Palau to discuss with President
Toribiong the next steps that Palau needs to take regarding the Compact. Thank you.

Dear Secretary Clinton,
Your assistant, Lona Valmoro, and I have been exchanging emails on trying to find a time to meet in Washington on July
30. I am hopeful something can be worked out. In the meantime, I wanted to take you up on your offer below and
provide you with a few thoughts on China prior to the upcoming SED on July 27-28. I send you this note from Beijing
(midway through a four-day visit) via Blackberry -- so apologies for any typos.
1. Mounting signs of social instability have intensified China's growth imperatives. Beijing insiders are very concerned
about the Xinjiang uprising; Hu Jintao's pre-G-8 exit validates those concerns. Coming on the heels of last year's
problems in Tibet, social instability can no longer be dismissed as an isolated occurrence. In both cases, my sources claim
growth shortfalls have exacerbated ethnic disturbances. China's recent fiscal stimulus -- especially infrastructure
initiatives in the West -- attempts to address this. Growth has long been modern China's antidote to the risks of social
instability.
2. A massive external demand shock dilutes the growth antidote that China needs to contain social instability. In fact,
the global recession adds a new risk factor to China's social instability equation. The government has confirmed reports
of over 20 million layoffs of migrant workers in export-intensive Guangdong Province -- a direct outgrowth of the
collapse of Chinese exports over the past year (from growth of +25% in mid-2008 to a contraction of -25% in May 2009).
Driven by a record capitulation of the American consumer -- real US consumption down by -1.8% over the past four
quarters (a 58-year record plunge) -- China's biggest source of end-market export demand has been hit with an
extraordinary shock. To the extent there is more to come on this count -- and that remains my best guess, although with
a less dramatic US consumption adjustment than we saw over the past year -- external demand pressures will continue
to undermine China's growth imperatives and feed heightened concerns over social instability.
3. China's stimulus package is a "quick fix" that can only exacerbate its already worrisome structural imbalances. The
focus of the stimulus is on its two most unbalanced sectors -- fixed investment and exports, which collectively account
for about 80% of Chinese GDP. Fully 72% of the RMB4 trillion fiscal initiative announced last November goes to
infrastructure. And there are aggressive incentives directed at exporters (i.e., tax rebates, "buy China" procurement
incentives, SME credit support, etc.). Moreover, there has been a huge push of State-directed bank lending -- the full-
year 2009 lending target was hit in mid-April! This latter initiative underscores the risks of deteriorating loan quality and
associated banking problems down the road. Meanwhile, despite public claims to the contrary, very little has been done
to stimulate the one sector in China that needs it the most -- internal private consumption. Social safety net efforts are
still puny -- the recent healthcare plan translates into US$30 per person for three years and the National Social Security
Fund only has enough assets to provide about $90 of lifetime social security benefits per worker! This forces fear-driven
-- or precautionary -- saving that, in turn, inhibits the consumer-led impetus a Chinese rebalancing urgently needs.

4. All this points to an asymmetrical global rebalancing -- a very worrisome prognosis for a post-crisis world. Despite all if
our problems, the US is actually tempering its greatest macro imbalance -- excess consumption. At the same time, China
is unfortunately upping the ante on its two most unbalanced sectors -- investment and exports. Sadly, this could set up a
still unbalanced global economy for another serious accident in the not-so-distant future.
Sorry to have rambled so much. There is a good deal more to each of the points above -- but wanted to give you the
highlights ahead of the SED. Good luck with that -- and with all else that seems to be going on around the world. Hope to
see you on the 30th.

Dear Secretary Clinton,
Although I regretfully missed seeing you on your swing through Beijing earlier this year, I will be back in Washington on
July 30. Would love the opportunity to meet with you briefly and give you up update on my thoughts/ insights into China
and the rest of the region. The story is not quite as neat as it appears on the surface. Despite all the hype, this region
remains an export machine that should struggle in the aftermath of the crisis -- with important implications for many of
the global economic issues you are facing. I have had extensive meetings throughout the region over the past few
months and would welcome the opportunity to provide you with a first hand assessment.
One other note: I will be publishing a book in Sept! Oct, "The Next Asia", which digs beneath the surface of many of the
macro issues the region faces. It is generally constructive on the Asian outlook but lays out a number of critical

OK. Went through it. It's not too much shorter, but I think it's tighter here and there. Made slight change at end to try
to tie in with how it started to bring full circle.
An area where you could save time and space (but I didn't try to change it) would be to shorten the parts where you talk
about Israel and Palestine and about Iraq and Afghanistan - it seems to me that those are tactical discussions of an
existing issue, and somewhat removed from the more abstract and strategic policy outline she's otherwise aiming at
here.
By the way, the phrase "global network of diverse partnerships" seems to be absent now. I kind of liked it on several
levels, but I presume it met some objection along the way...

OK. Went through it. It's not too much shorter, but I think it's tighter here and there. Made slight change at end to try
to tie in with how it started to bring full circle.
An area where you could save time and space (but I didn't try to change it) would be to shorten the parts where you talk
about Israel and Palestine and about Iraq and Afghanistan - it seems to me that those are tactical discussions of an
existing issue, and somewhat removed from the more abstract and strategic policy outline she's otherwise aiming at
here.
By the way, the phrase "global network of diverse partnerships" seems to be absent now. I kind of liked it on several
levels, but I presume it met some objection along the way...

AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE: Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has determined "it made no
sense" to press the U.S. for assistance, a senior
Israeli official said.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759019 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759019 Date: 06/30/2015
I really don't get it. On June 14, less than a month after his meeting with President Obama, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu gave one of the most comprehensive, thoughtful and highly personal speeches supporting the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process of any Israeli prime minister in recent years, perhaps ever.
One would have thought his speech would have been big news in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere. Mr. Netanyahu for
the first time clearly stated he would support a two-state solution, albeit with understandable requirements to
guarantee Israel's security, despite leaving a different impression during last month's U.S. visit.
Yet, the reaction of governments and media in the U.S. and Europe was the functional equivalent of a tree falling in the
forest with no one listening. Where it was covered, the writing emphasized the cynical and focused on the half-empty,
rather than the half-full, glass.
So let's take a closer look at what could turn out to be a very significant, game-changing speech. It can be divided,
essentially, into four parts: personal, historic, diplomatic and economic.
The personal aspect of the speech deals with the issue of peace. At one point, Mr. Netanyahu spoke directly to the
Palestinian people: "We want to live with you in peace, as good neighbors. We want our children and your children to
never again experience war: that parents, brothers and sisters will never again know the agony of losing loved ones in
battle; that our children will be able to dream of a better future and realize that dream; and that together we will invest
our energies in plowshares and pruning hooks, not swords and spears."
And then he reminded Palestinians that for him and his family, peace and war are quite personal: "I know the face of
war. 1 have experienced battle. I lost close friends. I lost a brother. I have seen the pain of bereaved families. I do not
want war. No one in Israel wants war."
Mr. Netanyahu also spent time in his speech on history, but not to relitigate the ancient argument over who lived in
Palestine first or for the longest time. Rather, Mr. Netanyahu explained that the "root of the conflict" has been based on
a fundamental misstatement of undeniable historical facts.
Palestinians have been taught that Israel was founded largely by alien foreigners, foisted on the native Palestinians by
Europeans feeling guilty over the Holocaust. That misstatement has been the central rationale for Arab and Palestinian
unwillingness to publicly recognize Israel as a Jewish state.
In fact, he points out, "the attacks against us began in the 1920s," 20 years before the Holocaust. And the undeniable
historical fact is that "the Jewish people and the land of Israel go back over 3,500 years" - when Abraham, Isaac and
Jacob, forefathers of all Jews; David and Solomon, ancient Israel's two greatest kings; and Isaiah and Jeremiah, two of

the Jewish religion's greatest spiritual prophets, all lived in what was then Judea and Samaria, which today is called the
West Bank.
"The right of the Jewish people to a state in the land of Israel does not derive from the cascade of catastrophes that
befell our people," the prime minister said. "There are those who say that if the Holocaust had not occurred, the state of
Israel would never have been established. But I say if the state of Israel would have been established earlier, it is the
Holocaust that would not have occurred."
Third, the prime minister addressed the two simple requirements for peace between Israel and the Palestinians:
recognition and security.
As to the first, he put it quite simply: "A fundamental prerequisite for ending the conflict is a public, binding and
unequivocal Palestinian recognition of Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people."
As to the security, it is also quite simple: Palestine must be demilitarized, as guaranteed by the international community,
with open skies, no military alliances with hostile powers, and "effective security measures to prevent weapons
smuggling into the territory - real monitoring, and not what occurs in Gaza today."
Once these two issues of recognition and security for Israel have been guaranteed, the rest of the difficult issues seem
to come much easier: no more new settlements, with some wiggle room for the natural growth of current settlements
caused by families growing; equitable treatment and assistance in placing refugees in land and homes outside of Israel
(to preserve the essence of historic Israel as a Jewish state).
And on the always controversial issue of Jerusalem, Mr. Netanyahu was deftly ambiguous: "Jerusalem, the capital of
Israel, must remain undivided, with continued religious freedom for all faiths." That does not seem to exclude
Palestinian de facto control over certain parts of Jerusalem and certainly over their holy places.
Finally, the prime minister expressed a clear and concrete vision of economic prosperity for Palestinians in partnership
with Israel. Indeed, he stated that such economic prosperity can come even before a final peace agreement is reached.
"An economic peace is not a substitute for a political peace but an important element in achieving it. Together we can
undertake projects that overcome the scarcities of our region, like water desalination, or maximize its advantages, like
developing solar energy, and exploiting our geographic location by laying gas and petroleum lines and establishing
transportation links between Asia, Africa and Europe....

"Together we can develop industrial areas that will generate thousands of jobs and develop tourist sites that will attract
millions of visitors eager to walk in the footsteps of history - in Nazareth and in Bethlehem, around the walls of Jericho
and the walls of Jerusalem, on the banks of the Sea of Galilee, and the baptismal site on the banks of the Jordan."
Who cannot be moved by these words? Perhaps Mr. Netanyahu has it right - a new sequencing of the peace process:
First, economic partnership and prosperity between Israelis and Palestinians; and then peace, not the other way around.
It could not have been by accident that Mr. Netanyahu chose to deliver his remarkable speech at the Begin-Sadat Center
at Bar-Ilan University. It was slightly more than 30 years ago, on March 26, 1979, that Prime Minister Menachem Begin,
as the leader of the right-wing Likud or "Consolidation" Party, joined with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and signed a
historic peace agreement between Israel and Egypt.
Now another man of the right, another Likud prime minister some three decades later, seems poised to make the lasting
peace between Israel and Palestinians that has so long eluded his predecessors.
One wonders whether Mr. Netanyahu might also be thinking: If Richard Nixon could go to China because of a base on
the right that trusted him, then I can bring peace and prosperity between Israelis and Palestinians.
Let's hope - and pray - that he is right.

I would like to suggest one overarching strategy for success.
Please do push hard on the donors (USAID included!) to pool the donor resources into one, at most two, multilateral
funding streams. Certainly the World Bank should be the main spigot, and IFAD possibly a second. By pooling the
resources, we'll cut down BY YEARS on the delays, donor negotiations, further talk, report writing, expert trips, etc., etc.,
which are now the biggest single threat to success of the initiative.
I look forward to a few minutes by phone or in person to offer some tips coming from long years of experience in this
sphere. This can be a real historic path-breaker, if it's not swallowed in the agencies!
Warm regards and kudos!

Below is the statement of very impressive Palau reps at the end of a session of required meetings on the next phase of
free association aid. FYI only, the Palauans were insulted by the nature and depth of the response to their proposal as
well as the content and the overall approach. They are even privately questioning the relationship. (This hasn't affected
their intent to take the Uighurs.) I will send a few further thoughts.
At the conclusion of yesterday's meeting, the Palau delegation caucused to discuss its reaction to the response of the
United States delegation to the proposals that it made in June in Washington D.C., and expanded upon in subsequent
communications.
While the Palau delegation has agreed to respond to certain additional questions raised by the United States delegation
on specific elements of the Palau proposal, and further has agreed to participate in certain working groups on specific
issues, the Palau delegation was deeply disappointed with the response of the United States delegation. The United
States delegation did not seriously respond, as required by the Compact, to the operational requirements of the
Government of Palau or to Palau's comprehensive and considered plans to achieve economic advancement and self-
sufficiency.
In light of the foregoing, the Palau delegation has determined that it must now return to Palau to discuss with President
Toribiong the next steps that Palau needs to take regarding the Compact. Thank you.

The WH just issued the below because the Biden story (based on interview with Peter Spiegel, WSJ, on way home from
Tblisi) gained momentum throughout the day
From Robert Gibbs:
"The President said in Moscow that the United States seeks a strong, peaceful and prosperous Russia - one that will be
an even more effective partner in meeting common challenges, including reducing nuclear arsenals, securing vulnerable
nuclear materials, contending with nuclear programs in North Korea and Iran, defeating violent extremism, and
advancing global security and economic growth.
Working together to advance security and prosperity for the American and Russian people is the focus of our effort to
reset relations. The President and Vice President believe Russia will work with us not out of weakness but out of
national interest."

o Is the 50k figure State and AID?
YES [U/S Kennedy & Ops]
o Re Sudan: how do you pronounce Abyei? What is % and dollar increase in
2010 budget for ops and aid?
Per the VoA pronunciation guide: ab-YAY (Ops). The FY09 base level for Sudan assistance programs is $327m vs $403m
in FY10- mostly related to infrastructure and election/referendum requirements. This does NOT include several hundred
million dollars of food aid and other humanitarian assistance that is also provided yearly (close to $400m on top of
numbers
below) a year. Also in addition is funding for UN peacekeeping missions- also nearly $200m a year. [D(L)]
o I don't understand the answer to the prostitution policy question. What's the simplest way to say it?
[Per D(L): Because of the politics of health care reform on the Hill, there is great sensitivity about addressing the
substance of these issues at this time.]
0: Under the previous Administration organizations receiving HIV\AIDs funds from the U.S. Government were required
to have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking. Is that going to continue to be the policy of this
Administration?
A: This matter has been the subject of litigation - outside groups have sued both USAID and the HHS over the policy -
and we recently notified the Court that we needed additional time to review the policy. That review is underway; no
final decisions have been made.

You did a great job on Meet the Press. The only thing I would add is when they ask you about the relationship b/w you
and the White House you can say not only that you are the diplomat in chief and the implementer, but also the architect
of the strategies we need actually to achieve the objectives and the visions that the President lays out. I hope you saw
the piece by Sid Kaplan in Slate that says you and the President are closer than any administration in recent memory. I
hope you get at least a tiny piece of Sunday to yourself! AMS

Just a quick note before leaving for Moscow, Rome and Central Asia. 1.4(D)

Moscow preparations are in reasonable shape. Afghan lethal transit agreement is done, and will be signed on Monday.
There's also a broader statement on cooperation on counter-narcotics and reconstruction in Afghanistan. (Bakiyev has
now signed the Manas agreement, which is a further boost on Afghanistan.)
The Presidents will announce the bilateral
commission, and your trip to Russia in the fall to launch the process with Lavrov. All in all a good measured realistic
step in our effort to rebuild relations --
I'll be in Rome just for the first, "foreign policy" portion of the G8. We're working on a Leaders' statement that is likely
to look a lot like last week's G8 Foreign Ministers statement on most issues, with an update on North Korea, and
essentially the same, firm line on Iran.
I leave Rome on July 9 with an interagency delegation for stops in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan,
back in DC on July 14.
Hope you had a good Fourth, and all the best,
Bill

Whenever you do something big on TV we all hear from lots of folks saying you did great. But this time is noticeably
different. First, people across the spectrum - DC insiders, reporters, staff, ex-staff, friends of friends, WH folks, etc -
were blown away. Second, people were REALLY moved by the last segment, three people even told me they teared up.
I'm guessing and hoping you hear this directly from random folks in the coming days.
And I think because it's been a lousy couple of weeks for the Admin, with mixed messages and bad news, coupled with
many people seeing you for the first time for an extended period talking about the job and your relationship with the
President, and that combo was probably the most powerful reminder since your speech in Denver that you're in a class
all your own (including the President who became enmeshed in the Gates incident)
That you didn't wait for the envoy question was key, you turned it into a strength. What you said about the President

Whenever you do something big on TV we all hear from lots of folks saying you did great. But this time is noticeably
different. First, people across the spectrum - DC insiders, reporters, staff, ex-staff, friends of friends, WH folks, etc -
were blown away. Second, people were REALLY moved by the last segment, three people even told me they teared up.
I'm guessing and hoping you hear this directly from random folks in the coming days.
And I think because it's been a lousy couple of weeks for the Admin, with mixed messages and bad news, coupled with
many people seeing you for the first time for an extended period talking about the job and your relationship with the
President, and that combo was probably the most powerful reminder since your speech in Denver that you're in a class
all your own (including the President who became enmeshed in the Gates incident)
That you didn't wait for the envoy question was key, you turned it into a strength. What you said about the President
and how you said it, one can't help but think how much of a team player you are and how remarkably you've adapted to
the role.

EUMM reported no overnight incidents and Georgian Interior Ministry concurs.
We are still seeking solid confirmation of all this and conveying messages to parties but with things moving in right
direction I don't think S-Lay call is any longer necessary.

I've got to have Lona get invites out today - the list is 18 after speaking with the Secretary on theory we will have yield of
12 - 14.
Before I have Lona invite anyone, I want to phase invites so our highest priorities have chance to response first and need
to know how big is too big to work; I have targeted 12-14 outside guests - given an expectation of 6-8 government folks.

1. Shaun Woodward, UK Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, suggested a panel at CGI to be conducted by former
President Clinton of British and Irish prime ministers, and perhaps leaders in NI, under the theme of "Implementing
Peace."
2. Former President Clinton has conveyed to me his approval, contingent on approval of the State Department.
3. I have copied below (and attached) Woodward's letter to me.
4. Let me know to move this forward.
Dear Sid,
Following our conversations about the CGI, it would be good to try and explore further now with President Clinton and
State the idea for an event at the CGI for Northern Ireland.
As you know, and very much thanks to the help again of HRC, we hope to be able to move forward with the final phase
of the political process in the Autumn.
As the CGI coincides with the UN meeting and also the G20, we should explore the idea of whether we could bring
together and participation of both the British and Irish Prime Ministers under the auspices of the CGI. The theme could
be 'Implementing Peace'. The session would explore the steps for the peace and political process in NI and obviously a
session could have wider application into say the Middle East peace and political process.
To take this forward it would be helpful to explore this with President Clinton and State, and following their expression
of interest/approval, I would take this forward with the British and Irish Prime Ministers.
Let me know your thoughts.
Best
Shaun

Subject: Secretary Clinton Must Focus on Cause of Congo Conflict
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton should focus on the fuel which drives the violence in Congo, the conflict minerals
extracted from the eastern war zone and widely used by our consumer electronics industry. "Clinton's visit to Goma
tomorrow provides the opportunity for the United States to deepen its overdue engagement in search of a solution for
the world's deadliest war," Enough Project co-founder John Prendergast said today.
"Tantalum helps cool cell phones and laptops. Tungsten enables the vibration function in a cell phone. Tin is a solder for
most circuit boards in nearly every electronic product. And gold is used to encase wiring. Until the trade in minerals
becomes legal and transparent, there will be no peace in Congo," Prendergast said.
Clinton earlier highlighted the role of conflict minerals in what she called "the unspeakable violence against women and
girls in eastern Congo."
"It is the worst example of man's inhumanity to women. And women are being used in conflicts. Now, what are the
conflicts about? Well, yes, there are tribal and other reasons why the conflicts are going on, but get below the surface.
It's because there are mines in eastern Congo that produce the minerals that go into our cell phones and our other
electronics. There is a lot of money being made by a lot of people, but it sure isn't helping the people of the DRC,"
Clinton said in an interview in Nairobi.
The majority of sexual violence cases reported in North Kivu since January have been attributed to government soldiers
according to the Congo Advocacy Coalition, a group of 88 humanitarian and human rights organizations, including
Enough Project. Early last month the Congolese Government announced a policy of "zero tolerance" for abuses
committed by army soldiers and said commanders who permit their troops to commit such crimes will be held
responsible but to date, only a handful of officers have been arrested.

"The increase in rape in an area where already so many women and girls have been victims is deplorable," said Olivia
Caeymaex of Enough. "Ending impunity for rape and other serious crimes needs to be at the heart of any strategy to
combat sexual violence. Secretary Clinton should ensure US diplomatic and financial assets are focused on bringing to
justice those who are most responsible."

Secretary Clinton's office has set up a website that will direct texts and emails to her when she's in Africa
TEXT THE SECRETARY on CONGO at 90822
"HELP WOMEN IN CONGO, STOP THE CONFLICT MINERALS TRADE"
Secretary Clinton should champion the conflict minerals legislation to ensure that it's signed into law and and

TEXT THE SECRETARY on SUDAN at 90822
"DO NOT END SUDAN SANCTIONS WITHOUT REAL PROGRESS"
At a recent Senate hearing on Sudan, Special Envoy Gration asked for "more space on sanctions" claiming that they were
hindering development in southern Sudan. Congress already took action in 2006 to create significant exceptions for the
south and other marginalized areas of Sudan for development purposes.
We should not roll back the sanctions. We need assurances from Secretary Clinton that the Obama Administration will
support keeping the sanctions in place until the Sudan government fulfills its obligations on the Comprehensive Peace
Agreement and the peace process in Darfur. You can text the message or email here.

A woman carrying her child runs for safety from the burning compound of presidential candidate Jean-Pierre Bemba's
bodyguards in Congo's capital, Kinshasa, in July 2006. Congo's largely successful elections in 2006 have not proven to be
a panacea to Congo's ills; 45,000 people die each month, mostly from the crippling effects of widespread conflict in the
Congo's eastern provinces.

Cheryl —
Well, I finally made it. Quite a start to be able to ride in with the President in AF1 and then roll into meetings with
Calderon and the leadership of the Mexican government. I will spend this week in Mexico. I will be back next week to
pack out, but will also follow up on a number of other issues while I am there.
I wanted to ask if you thought it might be possible to get a bit of time with the Secretary. There are two requests going
through the system. One is for a formal swearing in. I understand that she has one swearing in at 4:00 on Monday in
the Ben Franklin room, so one option would be if she could do the same for me in the Treaty Room at 4:30. I know this
is short notice — this has been one of those cases where planning has alluded us.
The second request is for a meeting with the Secretary. I would very much appreciate the chance to go over priorities
moving forward, as well as provide a few initial observations.

Preaching reform, Clinton wins African hearts
By DONNA BRYSON (AP) –1 hour ago
JOHANNESBURG — In Liberia, Hillary Clinton brought out the crowds despite torrential rain. In Congo, she came away
deeply shaken from a meeting with rape victims. Kenya's prime minister said Africa didn't need lectures from the West
about democracy, but Africa got one anyway.
At home, the U.S. secretary of state's visit may have been overshadowed by the aftermath of her husband's mission to
North Korea to bring home two imprisoned U.S. journalists. But on her seven-nation Africa tour, ending Friday with a
stopover in the West African island republic of Cape Verde, she made one splash after another.
Coupled with Barack Obama's visit last month, the two trips to Africa were the earliest into an administration by any
secretary of state or president, underlining Washington's pledges to pay more attention to the continent.
In the U.S., the headline-making moment of the trip was her testy response to a question about Bill Clinton. But in
Africa, it quickly became a footnote. What people wanted to hear was support for democracy, clean government and
ending its many civil wars.
Clinton's ambitious itinerary resembled those of China's foreign minister, who makes extensive annual tours of his
country's allies on the continent. But where China tends to sidestep the issues of corruption democracy, Clinton
confronted them head-on.
Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga, speaking hours before Clinton arrived, said Africa did not need to be lectured about
democracy. After they met, she did just that. "The absence of strong and effective democratic institutions has permitted
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759145 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759145 Date: 06/30/2015
ongoing corruption, impunity, politically motivated violence and a lack of respect for a rule of law," Clinton said. "These
conditions ... are continuing to hold Kenya back."
Odinga switched to a more conciliatory tone, saying African countries could learn from Clinton's example when she
conceded defeat to Obama during the U.S. presidential primaries.
"That is a lesson Africa needs to learn seriously," he said. "In Africa, in many countries, elections are never won, they are
only rigged. The losers never accept that they lost. If we do this, we will be able to develop democracy truly in the
African continent."
In Angola, she told Foreign Minister Assuncao Afonso dos Anjos that his country needed to write a new constitution,
prosecute human rights crimes and hold a proper presidential election.
"So, Mr. Minister, we have our work cut out for us," she said.
And in Nigeria, Africa's biggest oil producer, she said "the disconnect between Nigeria's wealth and its poverty is a
failure of governance at the federal, state and local level."
To Africa's reformers, often an embattled minority, these were heartening words.
Emma Ezeazu, who campaigns for free and fair elections in his native Nigeria, said Clinton's visit showed that U.S.
officials "are becoming more pro-active in their relationship with Nigeria, in particular on the subject of governance and
democracy. They are paying more attention."
Tiseke Kasambala, a Johannesburg-based researcher for Human Rights Watch, commended her grasp of human rights
abuses in Africa — not just the headline-makers, like Zimbabwe and Congo, but the lesser publicized offenders such as
Angola.
In Goma, a Congo town in a region ravaged by gang rapes amid continuing fighting between army and rebels, Clinton
announced $17 million in American aid to help the victims.
She toured a squalid camp of 18,000 refugees and heard one of them tell her, "We really want to return home, that's
why we are asking America to help stop the fighting."
"That's why I'm here," Clinton replied. "I want you to be able to go home."
In Cape Town, South Africa, big, joyous crowds turned out for her at a housing project. In Liberia, founded in 1847 by
freed American slaves, rain-drenched crowds waved U.S. and Liberian flags at Clinton's motorcade.
The crowds in Nigeria and Angola were fewer, but community and religious leaders seemed excited just to be with
Clinton and be heard by her.
Nancy Kachingwe, a Malawian with the development group ActionAid, applauded Clinton's "very strong emphasis
around women's rights."
Some of former President George W. Bush's Africa initiatives, particularly on AIDS, have been widely praised in Africa.
But there were also sharp differences over world trade, global warming, and over the Bush administration's anti-
terrorism strategy.
Washington wants to buy Africa's oil and gain access to its markets, and fears instability in places like Somalia could fuel
anti-U.S. terrorism. Clinton won points by stressing that as the U.S. pursues its interests, it sees the virtue of "working
with and listening to our friends and allies, and creating not a multipolar world, but a multi-partner world."

Kachingwe said what matters now is the follow-up.
"There will be a positive impact" from Clinton's trip, she said. "But somewhere along the way, we do need to see ...
what's going to come to keep the momentum going."

Clinton Ends Africa Tour, Vowing to Stay Involved By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN The New York Times
Published: August 15, 2009
SANTA MARIA, Cape Verde - After a grueling seven-nation, 11-day trip, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton
wrapped up her Africa tour on Friday by reaffirming her promise to renovate American relations with the continent.
"I leave Africa after this remarkable trip even more committed," Mrs. Clinton said before leaving Cape Verde.
"I have seen the joy and energy Africans have, evidenced not just by the boogieing, but by the hard work and
perseverance," she said, referring to a recent comment from her husband, former President Bill Clinton, that she knew
how to "boogie" with African dancers.
"And we've seen the worst humanity can do to itself," she added, presumably referring to Congo, where Mrs. Clinton
met victims of a brutal civil war that just does not seem to end.
Mrs. Clinton seemed satisfied that she had accomplished her mission: strengthening American relations with crucial
allies on the continent, like Nigeria and South Africa, and sending a message of "tough love," as she called it, to nations
like Kenya and Congo.
Over all, she said, the United States wants to work more closely with African nations as a partner, not simply as a patron
or dispenser of aid. In exchange, she said, African leaders must deliver democracy and good government.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759228 Date: 06/30/2015
Mrs. Clinton vowed to stay on top of Africa, even after she gets back to Washington, closely monitoring the issues she
addressed on her tour. She also pointed to Cape Verde, a set of palm-studded islands best known for their beaches and
enormous tourist hotels, as an example of what good leadership can do.
"This is possible," she said. "You create not just economic growth but a sense of human dignity and possibility."
Kenya. South Africa. Angola. Congo. Nigeria. Liberia. And finally Cape Verde. Mrs. Clinton saw with her own eyes some of
Africa's most promising countries - and some of its most troubled ones. In Kenya, she pushed for the government to
prosecute perpetrators of the postelection violence last year. In South Africa, the big issue was Zimbabwe and how the
South African government should do more to help ease the crisis there.
In Angola, the theme was good governing practices and oil, a strategic concern of the United States given the many
inroads China has made there and elsewhere in Africa in its hunger for natural resources. In Congo, Mrs. Clinton was
passionate about the need to end the nation's rape epidemic.
"The secretary's visit to the heart of the world's deadliest war zone in eastern Congo was a potential game-changer for
that conflict," said John Prendergast, a founder of the Washington-based Enough project. "Her commitment to
addressing root causes such as the conflict minerals that power our electronics industry was a refreshing contrast to the
usual disaster sympathy tourism of visiting dignitaries."
"Now," he added, "comes the hard part: making good on the promises and living up to the high expectations
engendered by her visit."
In Nigeria, Mrs. Clinton pressed for electoral changes. In Liberia, she praised the country's president, Ellen Johnson
Sirleaf, the only woman in Africa to be elected head of state.
The Liberian visit had a special warmth, almost like a meeting of long-lost cousins. Liberia was founded in the 19th
century by freed American slaves, and the country's flag, the people's names and even the police uniforms with plastic-
brimmed hats were all reminiscent of the American versions. Mrs. Clinton received possibly her most exuberant
welcome there, and a Liberian man with a long wooden horn followed her around most of the visit, blowing out loud
funny noises whenever she said something striking.
"I love that - the horn - I want to take that guy with me wherever I go," she said.
In Cape Verde, Mrs. Clinton seemed to have few bones to pick. For once, she said, she had a cheat sheet on a country
that included a list of far more positives than negatives. The country has fewer than 500,000 people and has escaped the
turmoil that has engulfed so much of Africa. The all-inclusive, poolside buffet resorts here feel like something found in
Canci.ln or the Bahamas.
Mrs. Clinton called Cape Verde "a model of democracy and economic progress in Africa."
On Friday, just as she had at every stop, she started her speech by saying, "I bring you greetings from President Obama."
She called him a "son of Africa" and said that under the Obama administration, the United States was determined to
help Africa reach its promise.

some more forceful intervention is needed. I think this is a real opportunity for S to get her first real diplomatic win on
resolving a crisis. She looked great at the outset of this crisis, but now American policy seems to be drifting. It's also a
chance to turn her and POTUS's recent words on democracy into action. Pse get the attached 1 page memo to her
today; I have been working w/ WHA but they take forever and Tom is obviously in a delicate position. I'm also pasting it
in below, in addition to a cable from our ambassador that she has probably seen making some of the same points. We
really need to move here to avoid further damage; on the upside we have the possibility of a real win. I'll make the
argument directly in the early morning mtg tomorrow, but I'd like her to see this first.

they think we will have to accept any post-election government You played an important leadership role at the outset of
the crisis; I urge you to think about taking bold action now to breathe new life into the process and signal that regardless
what happens on the Hill, you and the president are serious. WHA and I are working on a memo proposing some

options, but experience has taught me that this could take several days. So I wanted to give you a heads up this
weekend.
We need to strengthen both the carrots and the sticks in this process. Re the de factos, we should find that coup
was a "military coup" under U.S. law and revoke the visas of more de facto regime members. We should also go after
the visas of a few prominent de facto supporters in Honduras's business community, signaling that we'll widen this net
if negotiations fail. We should also make noises about prohibiting U.S. companies from.doing business with companies
controlled the de factos, though we have to be careful about the impact on Honduran institutions.
CABLE FROM AMB. Llorens, SENT YESTERDAY MORNING.
AIL: I received a call from Arias late last night. He seemed to be recovering well from the flu but was at his home
resting. I briefed him on how I saw the situation in Honduras. I stressed the importance of a successful visit by the OAS
FMs. I agreed M's recent public comments again suggesting that Insulza was not welcomed were unhelpful. I noted that
somewhat better was the statement made by the Corrales delegation yesterday at a press conference in Toncontin
Airport upon returning from DC reaffirming that Insulza was expected to be with the delegation. I told Arias the
importance of arranging a substantive schedule for the FMs w regime, civil society, business, and religious leaders as
well as pro-Zelaya social sector supporters. I also stressed the importance of giving these folks a fair hearing but also
that it was critical that the FMs explain the international community's expectations and strong hope that both sides
return quickly to San Jose and reach and sign a final agreement.
Arias concurred that that was also his expectation. He expressed concern that the regime may be seeking to stall and
delay. He said the regime delegation did not seemed fully committed to reaching a deal and seemed focused on
tinkering with the political amnesty question. Arias believes that the core regime supporters in the business community
were still strongly resisting an agreement. He suggested that the US needed to increase the pressure on these folks and
consider taking away their visas and possibly freeze their bank accounts. I said I would pass on his suggestion. I said we
were reaching out to people in Honduras and urging the importance of a succesful FMs meeting as a prelude to a final
agreement. I said I would also speak to Corrales and get him focused on having the regime prepared for the FMs with
creative and concrete ways of bolstering the enforcement aspects of a final deal. Arias thanked our support and we
agreed to speak again over the weekend. Hugo

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 11, 2009 Contact: Senator Levin's Office

Senate Floor Speech - Surge the Afghan Army
Remarks as prepared for delivery
Today we mark a solemn anniversary. Eight years ago this morning, our nation was attacked by terrorist extremists
motivated by hatred and bent on destruction. It is always appropriate to remember the shock of that day, the innocent
lives lost, and the efforts our nation has made since that day to ensure that Afghanistan, the nation that hosted those
terrorists, cannot again become a safe haven for terrorists seeking to attack us. But today is an especially appropriate
occasion to take stock of those efforts, and consider how best to continue them.
I recently returned from a trip to Afghanistan, where I was joined by my colleagues Senators Jack Reed and Ted
Kaufman. The situation in Afghanistan is serious. Security has deteriorated. But if we take the right steps, we can ensure
that Afghanistan does not revert to a Taliban-friendly government that could once again provide a safe haven for al
Qaeda to terrorize us and the world.
The Obama administration's new strategy, focusing on securing the Afghan population's safety and partnering with the
Afghan security forces in that effort, is an important start at reversing the situation in Afghanistan. The change in
strategy has led our forces, in the words of General McChrystal's Counterinsurgency Guidance, to "live, eat and train
together [with the Afghan security forces], plan and operate together, depend on one another, and hold each other
accountable....and treat them as equal partners in success." The Guidance goes on to say that the success of the Afghan
security forces "is our goal."

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759468 Date: 06/30/2015
To achieve that goal we should increase and accelerate our efforts to support the Afghan security forces in their efforts
to become self-sufficient in delivering security to their nation — before we consider whether to increase U.S. combat
forces above the levels already planned for the next few months. These steps include increasing the size of the Afghan
Army and police much faster than presently planned; providing more trainers for the Afghan Army and police than
presently planned; providing them more equipment than presently planned; and working to separate local Taliban
fighters from their leaders and attract them to the side of the government as we did in Iraq.
While the security situation in Afghanistan has worsened, we still have important advantages there. The Afghan people
hate the Taliban. Public opinion polls show support for the Taliban at about 5%. In addition, the Afghan army is highly
motivated and its troops are proven fighters.
Despite those advantages, we face significant challenges. General McChrystal believes, and I agree, that we need to
regain the initiative and create a momentum towards success. General McChrystal worries, and rightly so, about the
perception that we have lost that initiative, and the impact of that perception on the Afghan people, their government,
al Qaeda and the Taliban. By contrast, if we can dispel that perception, we have a chance to convince local and lower-
level Taliban fighters to lay down their arms and rejoin Afghan society.
I believe the most effective way to retake the initiative in Afghanistan is with a series of steps to ensure that
Afghanistan's army and police have the manpower, equipment and support to secure their own nation.
First, we should increase troop levels for the Afghan army and police faster than currently planned. There are
approximately 90,000 troops in the Afghan army now, and that number is scheduled to go up to 134,000 by October of
2010. The Afghan police are scheduled to reach a level of 82,000 by the same time. For a long time, many of us have
urged the establishment of a goal of 240,000 Afghan troops and 160,000 Afghan police by 2013. The Afghan Minister of
Defense has strongly supported those numbers. It now appears that our government and the Afghan government are
prepared to accept those goals. But the need for additional Afghan forces is urgent. I believe it both possible and
essential to advance those goals by a year, to 2012.
Our own military in Afghariistan has repeatedly pointed to a need for more Afghan forces. In one sector of Helmand
province we visited last week, our Marines outnumbered Afghan soldiers by 5 to one. A Marine Company commander in
Helmand province told the New York Times in July that a lack of Afghan troops "is absolutely our Achilles heel."
What do we need to do to increase the size of the Afghan army and police? According to Afghan Defense Minister
Wardak, there is no lack of Afghan manpower; we've been assured it is available.
But we will need significantly more trainers. We asked General Formica, who is in charge of the American effort to train
Afghan security forces, whether such an increase is possible. He indicated he would make an assessment of what would
be necessary in order to meet the earlier timetable. In the meantime, we should also press our NATO allies with much
greater forcefulness to provide more trainers. If our NATO allies are not going to come through with the combat forces
they have pledged, at least they could provide additional trainers.
Larger Afghan security forces will also require more mid-level Afghan officers. In addition to supporting efforts to
graduate more Afghan officers from army academies, we should consider the recommendation of Defense Minister
Wardak that previous mid-level officers who fought the war against the Soviets return to service on an interim basis.
Minister Wardak emphasized that those men are well qualified and well motivated, and while they may not be trained in
the most current tactics, they nonetheless could temporarily meet the need of the enlarged army while the new group
of officers is trained. A larger Afghan force will need supporting infrastructure, such a barracks. While the available
infrastructure may not be the most modern, it is adequate and exists in sufficient amounts.
Larger Afghan security forces will require additional equipment. There must be a major effort to transfer a significant
amount of the equipment that is coming out of Iraq to the Afghan army and police. Such a significant commitment to
equip the Afghan security forces would also help demonstrate U.S. determination to take the initiative and create
momentum in the right direction. There is an enormous amount of equipment coming out of Iraq; our military is calling
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759468 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759468 Date: 06/30/2015
it one of the greatest transfers of military goods in the world's history. A significant part of it could be transferred to the
Afghan forces, increasing their capability without weakening our own readiness. And yet there does not seem to be that
kind of a crash effort in place to do that. We need to obtain on an urgent basis a list of the basic equipment needs of the
Afghan forces and a list of how those needs could be met in a major program to transfer equipment leaving Iraq.
Rapidly expanding Afghanistan's military and police forces would address one of the major problems and risks we now
face there. General McChrystal told us he worries that waiting until 2013 for a larger Afghan force creates a gap in
capabilities that brings significant risk of failure. But by accelerating the training and equipping of Afghan forces by a
year, we address his concern. Depending on additional capability from Afghan, rather than U.S., forces, also addresses a
major problem of public perception in Afghanistan. The larger our own military footprint there, the more our enemies
can seek to drive a wedge between us and the Afghan population, spreading the falsehood that we seek to dominate a
Muslim nation.
Finally, we should make a concerted effort to separate the local Taliban from their leaders. In Iraq, large numbers of
young Iraqis who had been attacking us switched over to our side and became.the "Sons of Iraq." They were drawn in
part by the promise of jobs and amnesty for past attacks, and in part by the recognition that the status quo was creating
horrific violence in their own communities. In their own interests and the interests of their nation, they switched sides
and became a positive force.
That same prospect exists in Afghanistan. Afghan leaders and our military say that local Taliban fighters are motivated
largely by the need for a job or loyalty to the local leader who pays them and not by ideology or religious zeal. They
believe an effort to attract these fighters to the government's side could succeed, if they are offered security for
themselves and their families, and if there is no penalty for previous activity against us.
General McChrystal himself has emphasized the potential of such re-integration to accomplish the same result as was
achieved in Iraq. Here is what General McChrystal said on July 28th:
"Most of the fighters we see in Afghanistan are Afghans, some with foreign cadre with them. But most we don't see are
deeply ideological or even politically motivated; most are operating for pay; some are under a commander's charismatic
leadership; some are frustrated with local leaders. So I believe there is significant potential to go after what I would call
mid- and low-level Taliban fighters and leaders and offer them re-integration into Afghanistan under the constitution."
But this "game changing" possibility was apparently not factored into General McChrystal's assessment. There is no plan
yet to put in place a Sons of Iraq approach in Afghanistan. It is urgent that we lay out the steps that need to be taken to
involve local and national Afghan leaders in that effort. They alone can accomplish this crucial job, but first we and our
Afghan allies must draft such a plan on an urgent basis. And the potential positive impact of such a plan should be taken
into account as we consider the need for any additional U.S. military resources.
Afghanistan's people are grateful for our aid, but also eager to assume responsibility for their future. In a tiny village in
Helmand Province, we were invited to meet with the village elders at their council meeting, their shura. One hundred or
so men sat on the floor and chatted with us about their future and their country's future. When asked how long the
United States should stay, one elder said: "Until the moment that you make our security forces self-sufficient. Then you
will be welcome to visit us, not as soldiers but as guests."
Helping Afghanistan achieve self-sufficiency in their security is everybody's goal. On that there is little difference of
opinion, in Afghanistan's village councils or in the corridors of this Capitol.
Can we help Afghanistan reach self-sufficiency in security fast enough? Can we get there in a way that regains the
initiative and creates the momentum we need? Can we encourage those lower level Taliban to abandon an insurgency
headed by terrorists whose fanaticism they don't share?
I believe we can, by supporting a far more rapid growth in the Afghan Army and police; by providing more trainers more
quickly; by a rapid infusion to Afghan units of equipment no longer needed in Iraq; and by rapidly adopting a plan for the
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759468 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759468 Date: 06/30/2015
re-integration of lower level Taliban fighters into Afghan society. In other words, we need a surge of Afghan security
forces.
Our support of their surge will show our commitment to the success of a mission that is clearly in our national security
interest, without creating a bigger U.S. military footprint that provides propaganda fodder for the Taliban.
I believe that taking those steps on an urgent basis, While completing the previously planned and announced increase in
U.S. combat forces, provides the best chance of success for our mission: preventing Afghanistan from again being run by
a Taliban government which harbors and supports Al-Qaeda, whose goal is to inflict additional catastrophic attacks on
the United States and the world. And we should implement these steps before considering an increase in U.S. ground
combat forces beyond what is already planned by the end of this year.

SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED
Somalia
Cheryl noted that she needed to hear further from the Secretary on the proposed changes to the OFAC letter with
respect to humanitarian assistance to Somalia and the potential for diversion. She indicated she would let Eric Schwartz
know where things stand.
Afghanistan

Jack stressed his continued concern over funding for the transfer of police training responsibilities from Defense to
State, noting that it remains "highly ambiguous." (The estimated cost is an initial $500 million, with an additional $700
million a year in expenses.) Defense is insisting it does not have money to transfer to State for this purpose, and the
idea of a Supplemental is problematic, not the least because the timing would not coincide with the transfer of
responsibilities. Jack is concerned that we will look like we are holding up the transfer.
Chinese Tires
Jim reported that there had been another meeting on Chinese tire imports yesterday where there was interagency
agreement on the "first best option," but disagreement over other options. The Chinese are in town for negotiations
and there will be another meeting tomorrow after the first round.
Baghdad Management Issues
Eric Boswell noted that the Department would extend
Eric also noted that the roof of the USAID building in Baghdad had collapsed.
Congressional Issues
Rich said that he met with Senator DeMint yesterday to discuss the holds on Valenzuela and Shannon. Rich thinks
DeMint is prepared to let Valenzuela go forward, but would like to speak to Jim Steinberg regarding Honduras. He will
insist on a debate and roll call vote for Tom Shannon. DeMint apparently warned, however, that any "substantive
change" in our current policy vis-à-vis Honduras would jeopardize both nominations.
Codel Levin will be heading to Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq, but will not overlap with Jack Lew's stay in those
places.

Legal Issues
Harold said that one fallout from the renewed focus on Libya is that some former claimants are coming back
seeking new relief.
Hurricane Jimena
I noted that Hurricane Jimena is expected to make landfall in Baja early tomorrow morning as a powerful Category
4 or 5 Hurricane. Embassy Mexico City and Consulate General Tijuana have issued warden messages and Consular
Affairs has put out a travel alert advising citizens to avoid the areas likely to be hit. Many hotels in the path of the storm
have been largely evacuated, but there are still many Americans who could be affected. The Ops Center is in close touch
with our missions in Mexico to monitor conditions.
Public Affairs
RI anticipates questions about Iran's alleged willingness to restart talks and whether the Secretary will meet with
Zelaya.
Deputies Meeting Highlights
Sri Lanka
The War Crimes Office said that the report to the Hill on alleged war crimes in Sri Lanka is due by September 21.
They have prepared a 60-page draft which is now circulating for clearance. The report covers the period up to May, but
Jack encouraged the Office to consider including later material if it would be helpful.
Pakistani Internally Displaced Persons
Eric Schwartz said that the Op-ed in today's post by Morton Abramowitz criticizing the U.S. and Pakistan for
allegedly forcing the return of IDPs into Swat and other areas is simply not true. Eric said he would call Mort to discuss
this.

Export Controls
Andrew Shapiro noted that the interagency process aimed at "reforming" export controls gets underway today.
The goal is to have something to present to Deputies in six weeks.
Brazilian Oil Development
David Goldwyn said that Brazil's proposed regulations for developing its vast offshore petroleum reserves were
disappointing. Brazil seems to have opted for a nationalist model that will substantially delay bringing on line the most
promising non-OPEC source of oil in years.
H1N1
OES reported that the Administration will release its report on H1N1 in the Southern Hemisphere today. The
analysis of the virus in several developed countries in the region suggests that it has not mutated and that the vaccine
being developed should be effective. It is still not clear, however, whether one or two doses will be required.

Dear Melanne,
We've been in contact with Salam Alshehri, the project coordinator of the newly launched Entelak school program
Glamour helped create for young girls through Sana'a's Girls World Communication Center. She reports that they are in
contact with Nujood who is in fact in third grade at a private school. While Nujood isn't in the demographic for the
Entelak Project since she's still young enough for public (free) education, she is the role model for the targeted girls.

And since Nujood is the spirit of the Project, Salam and her colleagues are thinking of ways to include her in the activities
and trainings as much as possible.
We've also spoken to Delphine Minoui, the French reporter who first covered Nujood's case and has since co-written
Nujood's autobiography. Delphine has taken on the funding of Nujood's private schooling and confirms that Nujood is in
fact still attending school. CNN got it wrong apparently,
Let me know if you'd like to brainstorm about other ways to help support Nujood.
All best,

Counseling That Helps the Dying Live
By Devin Talbott and Strobe Talbott
Saturday, August 29, 2009
Many opponents of health-care reform have concentrated their fire on a provision in House legislation that would
provide for government reimbursement to doctors who offer end-of-life counseling. How our society deals with those
confronting death is understandably controversial. Unfortunately, the debate has degenerated into a cacophony of
demagoguery and distortion, including invocations of Hitler and fear-mongering about "death panels." As a result of
these attacks, a number of senators who are key to determining what bill will emerge from Congress have abandoned
support for end-of-life counseling.
Our family's experience this year provided a vivid perspective on the value of that service and the misguidedness of the
campaign against it. Brooke Shearer <http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-
dyn/content/article/2009/05/19/AR2009051903475.html> -- wife, mother and grandmother -- had been fighting cancer
for more than a year. She had undergone major surgery, numerous scans and biopsies, and two debilitating courses of
chemotherapy. Her doctors were among the best in their fields. Their expertise did not, however, extend to the fine
points of, and latest advances in, pain management.
Brooke was determined to maintain the highest possible quality of her own life and that of her family for whatever time
we had together. With that goal in mind, she sought advice and treatment from palliative-care specialists at Washington
Home and Community Hospices. Their ingenuity and skill in adjusting her medications significantly alleviated her
discomfort in her final months. Working closely with her primary physicians, the hospice staff helped Brooke anticipate
the likely course of her disease in a way that allowed her to make decisions and exercise a degree of control over both
her own condition and our family's adjustment to it.
When her oncologist concluded that chemotherapy was not working, Brooke put herself fully into the hands of
Washington Home as an outpatient. Regular house calls by hospice doctors, nurses and social workers enabled her to
stay active on professional projects, spend time with friends and family, and end her life at home, which was a
considerable comfort to her and to us.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759543 Date: 06/30/2015
These, not issues of cost, were the principal considerations for our family. However, controlling the cost of health care --
especially in the last year of life -- is an important part of the current national debate. Therefore it is worth noting that
Brooke's treatment in the last stages of her illness was far less expensive than it had been in the previous year.
It has often been said that dying can be a full-time job. That was emphatically not the case with Brooke. Until her final
days, she concentrated on living -- a choice that end-of-life counseling helped make possible. Hospice care more than
meets the standard of the Hippocratic oath: It not only does no harm -- it does good; it is not about hastening death but
enhancing life. If counseling about hospice services and palliative care is a beneficiary of health care reform, many
Americans will be as well.

Subject: Possible Rieser Call on Foreign Ops Bill
Cheryl:
We have just learned that Tim Rieser may call you soon to request that the Secretary call Senator Reid to urge him take
up the FY10 State/Foreign Ops Appropriations Bill at the earliest opportunity in September— to avoid the negative
impact of a continuing resolution on State operations and programs.
As you know, if Senator Reid was able/willing to schedule time on the Senate floor there still remains a significant
obstacle. While the FY10 Bill had broad bipartisan support prior to markup, it now includes a controversial Lautenberg
amendment that would reverse the Mexico City policy statutorily. With Lautenberg's amendment in the Bill, procedural
hurdles are almost certain to lengthen and slow down floor action.
It is possible that an agreement could be reached to bring up the Bill and structure votes so that the Republicans could
offer amendments including one to strike Lautenberg's language.
Should you agree to ask the Secretary to make such a call I would imagine she would want to get views from Jack Lew,
Pat Kennedy, Rich Greene, and Rich Verma, first.
Here are some points to consider for such a possible call:
Timely enactment of the FY 10 State/Foreign Ops appropriation is critical to national security.
• Operating under a Continuing Resolution for any extended period of time will negatively impact both State
operations and foreign assistance programs.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759552 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759552 Date: 06/30/2015
• For example, the funds available to support State operations in Iraq are estimated to last only through the first
quarter of FY 2010. In addition our urgent hiring plans will be stifled, pay equity authorities will lapse, and we will be
without the necessary resources to implement our agenda on food security, climate change, and global health.
I urge you to take up the FY 10 State/Foreign Ops bill as early as possible in September.
Background
Mexico City Policy: The inclusion during markup of the Lautenberg amendment in the Senate bill codifies a ban on future
adoption of the Mexico City Policy. This controversial issue will slow down consideration of the Bill, as the Minority will
use parliamentary maneuvers to block timely debate and final passage.

We were judging the candidates for the Swanee Hunt Award which goes annually to a FS0 and a FSN judged superior
for integrating women's issues into their work. T hey are nominated by ambassadors at posts or AS's here.
I called her because we had a tie for the FSO's and I wanted to see if she'd provide a second monetary award so we
wouldn't have to divide the $5k. She agreed and then told me
State will fly in the awardees and the Secry usually gives out the award. Swanee is hoping that she'll be able to come and
be there for the brief ceremony.
I thought you'd want to know.

Subject: 2-page memo on contracting
Jake and Cheryl,
Allison Stanger is a professor at Middlebury who has a book coming out on contracting — she has spent the last
3 years tracking down more data on the full scope of the contracting problem than anyone else and has done the most
sophisticated thinking about what we need to do. She has a book coming out from Yale University Press this fall; the
attached 2 pager summarizes her best thinking. She was supposed to brief Jack earlier this summer but it got canceled;
I'll have her down to talk to QDDR team. But meantime, given that issue is current right now, I thought S might benefit
from reading this.

Smart-Sourcing Diplomacy and Development
While most Americans do not know it, the business of foreign policy is increasingly in private hands. In 2000, the State
Department spent $1.3 billion on contracts and $102.5 million on grants. By 2008, grant spending had grown to $2.5
billion and contract spending had grown to $5.6 billion. In 2000, USAID spent $0 on grants[1] and $478.6 million on
contracts. By 2008, those figures had climbed to $5.2 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively (source: USAspending.gov[2]).
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759571 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759571 Date: 06/30/2015
Contracting is still perceived as something peripheral to policy itself, but when contracting and grants comprise 75
percent of State's total budget, as they did in 2008, that is clearly no longer the case.
The privatization trend predates the Bush Administration and is in part an appropriate response to globalization's
possibilities and more generally the changing nature of American power. But during the last eight years, laissez-faire
outsourcing to execute two ambitious wars carried the day, and oversight and management were often outsourced as
well as implementation. Today, the State Department and especially USAID are dependent on contractors, and
outsourcing, in turn, has remade the work environment for federal employees. Negative consequences are a private
sector that has been granted power without responsibility, a diminished and overtaxed DSS, a demoralized USAID, and
looming catastrophe in Iraq and Afghanistan, where reconstruction money first flowed into everyone's pockets except
those of ordinary citizens.
What is to be done? Smart-sourcing, not in-sourcing
To align our practices with our interests, the centrality of outsourcing to the contemporary business of government must
be properly acknowledged. America's allies today include a range of non-governmental actors, both for-profit and non-
profit, who are recipients of taxpayer dollars. While policy was once something that government devised (the "what")
and contractors executed (the "how"), that is no longer the case in the information age. Especially in the development
realm, success or failure today turns on the how of US strategy, which effectively places a web of non-governmental
personnel in key policy-making positions. Since both development and democracy demand the engagement and
employment of local populations, turning the clock back and bringing whatever possible back in house would therefore
be a cure worse than the disease. We don't need a new prescription for our glasses; we need a new eye chart.
A smart-sourcing approach defines the "how" of policy as a strategic issue and proceeds on two fronts simultaneously.
First, smart-sourcing means building capacity for managing what OMB's July guidelines on contracting call the multi-
sector workforce. State Department contracting, programming, and information technology functions must be
redefined as collaborative ventures, so that State might more effectively orchestrate mission-oriented networks across
the public-private divide. Second, smart-sourcing involves identifying tasks that should never have been outsourced and
bringing those back in-house. It may be easiest to in-source according to political expediency, but that temptation must
be avoided. Clear guidelines for the limits of outsourcing must be delineated so that strategic rather than ad hoc choices
can be made. Both reforms have the virtue of directly advancing objectives outlined in OMB Director Peter Orszag's
July memoranda.
More specifically, a State Department committed to smart-sourcing should:
Support and promote OMB efforts to improve contracts and grants data quality, as well as the further
development of USA spending.gov to include subcontracts and subgrants. Transparency and accountability are the
critical values in a smart-sourcing orientation, and our anti-corruption efforts abroad will have enhanced credibility
when we are perceived to be upholding the same values at home.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759571 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759571 Date: 06/30/2015
Restructure USAID so that it has the capacity to manage its contracts as well as write checks. Capacity involves
more than FTE counts. State needs to recruit, train, and retain a workforce of twenty-first century network managers
who can ensure quality work at all stages of a given project.
Rebuild DSS so that State can phase out reliance on armed contractors in war zones. Our current practices blur the
line between the legitimate and illegitimate use of force, which is just what terrorists want.
Craft contracts that employ the foreigners we are trying to help. Sustainable development follows from the
bottom-up engagement of local populations, not top-down advice from US experts. A sense of local ownership is often
best fostered by foreign nationals written into contracts and grants rather than being directly employed by the USG.
Consider the lessons of the MCC and the expanded contributions of the NGO community in charting USAID's
future. Both devolve decision-making to the local level and involve a less prominent USG footprint. If organizations like
the Clinton Global Initiative and the Gates Foundation advance American interests more effectively than traditional
direct government intervention, overseas direct investment may be a dated policy instrument.
Follow the money and identify DOD reconstruction contracts that rightfully belonged in State's domain to bolster
the already compelling argument for greater civilian resources. There can be no smart power without smart-sourcing.
Bottom line: The information revolution has rendered big government vs. small government debates beside the point.
To paraphrase President Obama's inaugural address, we don't need a big State Department or a small State Department
but a State Department that works. A smart-sourcing approach to reform will strengthen the operational link between
policy and resources, enabling State to exploit all the networks at its disposal in ways that advance the interests of the
United States. Nothing could be more strategic.
[1] USAID's problematic accounting practices are currently on full public display at USAspending.gov. No data on grants
is provided for FY2000-2006.
[2] Data quality appears extremely variable, especially for USAID, but for general trends, it can suffice. I use 2008
numbers for the comparison, since 2009 aggregate numbers are still a moving target.

We are sad to be spreading the news of the passing of Marion Sinek, beloved mother, grandmother, and
friend, and tireless public servant. She believed in the dignity of each human being, respect for all, social justice, and
family.
The following text is the formal announcement of her passing:
Marion Sinek passed away peacefully on August 17, 2009 at age 78 after a long illness. She was born in
Berlin, Germany, and came to the US just before the beginning of WWII. She graduated from Forest Hills High School
and Syracuse University on a full scholarship. After graduate work at the London School of Economics, she worked for
Radio Free Europe and the UN Association-USA in NY. Marion became very active in public affairs, serving in various
roles for the League of Women voters, including President of the LWV of NY State. She later ran for office, serving for
eight years as a Town Board member in New Castle before becoming its Supervisor from 2000 to 2004. She later
worked with Sen. Hillary Clinton's office on election law issues, and remained active in Democratic politics and other
organizations. She served on the Compensation Advisory Panel to the Westchester County Board of Legislators, and
served on the boards of The Chappaqua Orchestra and the Holocaust and Human Rights Education Center. She lived in
Chappaqua for almost 38 years. She was predeceased by her husband Herbert; she is survived by her children Ron and
Nicole (Arnaboldi), their spouses Jennifer and Leo, and seven grandchildren. Burial will be private. A memorial will be
held in September. In lieu of flowers, donations in her memory may be made to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center.
We know you join us in mourning the passing of a wonderful human being.

BusinessWeek Ranks Department of State #5 Best Place to Launch a Career: The Department ranked at the top
among federal agencies and #5 among all employers as one of the best places to begin a career. With an increase from
#12 last year to #5 this year, BusinessWeek ranked the Department in the Top 20 for the fourth consecutive year. The
ranking is based on a three-part methodology that includes combined survey data from careers services directors,
undergraduate students, and employers. For further information, please visit

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
DELOITTE & TOUCHE TOPS BUSINESSWEEK'S ANNUAL LIST OF
"BEST PLACES TO LAUNCH A CAREER"
New York, New York, September 3, 2009— The big four accounting firms once again dominate BusinessWeek's
fourth annual ranking of the "Best Places to Launch a Career." Deloitte & Touche jumped to the No.1 spot, unseating
Ernst & Young who ranked No.2. PricewaterhouseCoopers and KPMG took the third and fourth spot, respectively.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759596 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759596 Date: 06/30/2015
With rich benefits, extensive training programs, and a combined recruiting effort that makes more than 10,000
hires even in a tough year, the Big Four are hard to beat, and Deloitte is harder than most. With substantially higher
pay-18% of Deloitte's entry-level hires this year will earn north of $65,000—plus the industry's biggest signing bonuses
and most generous time-off policy, it's no wonder Deloitte is a favorite of students and career services directors. It
doesn't hurt that Deloitte's entry-level hiring took the smallest hit this year, down just 1.1% in the first half compared
with double-digit drops for No.2 Ernst & Young and No.4 KPMG.
To compile this ranking, BusinessWeek polled 60 college career services directors across the country; collected
data from a survey of 60,000 U.S. undergrads by Universum USA, a Philadelphia research company; and required
employers to submit statistics on everything from pay and benefits to training programs and retention. The number of
ranked employers is down sharply this year, owing to our decision to raise the bar on eligibility. And the tougher
competition—combined with a handful of new employers and shifts in sentiment among students and career services
directors—resulted in a shakeup in the standings.
Some companies, including No.11 Accenture and No.19 Prudential moved up more than 35 spots, while No.34
Marriott and No.48 Lockheed Martin were down 28 and 40 spots, respectively. Even the top 10 underwent big changes
this year. Marriott and Lockheed were out, as was Google, which declined to participate. But three new employers
entered the winner's circle. The State Dept. and Teach For America, which places college grads in troubled school
districts, are both in the midst of ramped-up recruiting campaigns, while J.P. Morgan, a unit ofJPMorgan Chase, reaped
a survivor's benefit: It's one of the few big investment banks left standing.
BusinessWeek's "Best Places to Launch a Career" ranking is in the September 14, 2009 issue, on newsstands
September 4th. Expanded content is available on BusinessWeek.com, including the full methodology, profiles of each
employer, an interactive table, slide shows, and a video roundtable with recruiters.

Congresswoman's son-in-law dies snorkeling
August 12, 2009 4:29 PM I UPDATED STORY
The son-in-law of U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-III.) died Sunday in a snorkeling accident as he vacationed in Mexico with
his family, her office and family said.
Michael McLaughlin, 38, was with Schakowsky and other family members near Tulum, Mexico, at the beginning of a
week long vacation, Schakowsky's husband Robert Creamer said.
McLaughlin was married to Lauren, 35, who is the daughter of Schakowsky's husband and his previous wife Day Piercy,
who lives in New York.
McLaughlin was a filmmaker and editor who lived with his wife in Queens, N.Y.
Creamer said he and other family members were in their hotel near Solinon Bay when another guest with binoculars
told them there appeared to be a problem with McLaughlin, who was snorkeling in the bay about 7 miles north of
Tul urn.
Creamer was the first to reach McLaughlin in a kayak. He said he found his son-in-law face down in the water, and called
out to him but got no response. Creamer said he got closer, turned his son-in-law over and realized he was in trouble. He
administered mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and put a life vest on him, Creamer said.
"I yelled at him and poked at him and got no response, so I turned him over and it was clear he wasn't breathing," said
Creamer.
McLaughlin's wife then showed up along with Schakowsky and others in more kayaks to help put McLaughlin on a kayak
in the nearly 7-feet of water. Others also arrived in more kayaks to assist and pulled the craft carrying McLaughlin onto
the beach where they continued to try to revive him unsuccessfully.
McLaughlin was pronounced dead at a local hospital a short time later, Creamer said.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759603 Date: 06/30/2015
In a phone interview from Mexico, Creamer said McLaughlin was an experienced snorkeler and diver who liked to
snorkel alone, a coroner's report said he had aspirated in his mask and died of asphyxiation, he said.
McLaughlin was cremated, following his own request, Creamer said.
Creamer described himself as heartbroken and praised his son-in-law and the 7-year marriage to his daughter. The
couple had planned to adopt their first child in September.
"Michael was one of the most loving and creative people I've ever met.... and he and my daughter Lauren had one of
the most loving marriages I have ever seen," Creamer said.
In 2005 Schakowsky's daughter-in-law Fiona died of cancer. She had been married to Schakowsky's son Ian.
Born Oct. 26, 1970, in Berkeley, Calif., McLaughlin was the oldest of three children and grew up in "the shadow of Mount
Tamalpais, in Mann County," according to Creamer.
As a young man, McLaughlin was known for his love for the outdoors as his dinner table quips that entertained his
family. As a young adult, he attended Sarah Lawrence College where he studied theater and moved with a friend to New
York City, following college.
His family said McLaughlin never lost his zest for adventure, regularly white water rafting, skydiving, backpacking and
studying Karate.
McLaughlin later moved to San Francisco, where he met his wife Lauren and married her in July 2002. During their
marriage, McLaughlin helped his wife start her own business and she helped him pursue his film career as a filmmaker,
his family said.
During McLaughlin's career he worked in live theater, puppetry and short fiction. His short film "Shadow Puppets of
Doom" was shown in film festivals and won the "Best Screenplay" award in the Mann County Film Festival, his family
said. At the time of his death he was filming a pilot reality television show.
McLaughlin is survived by his wife, Lauren Creamer McLaughlin, his mother, Rohana, his sister, Halima, and his brother,
Marlin.

The US Ambassador to UNESCO is launching a fierce, ferocious, unfair campaign against the Egyptian candidate to
UNESCO Minister Farouk Hosni.
If Washington does not want him — for whatever reasons — this is acceptable as their choice, but we think the US, with
its principles and weight, should be a fair partner and an objective leader.
People here are surprised at the position of the US Ambassador. They say "We want to feel that change is not just a
Motto but starts a new era in our relationship"
Hosni is an open-minded person who respects all religions. He is accused of being Anti-Jewish. That is not true. The
allegation is based on a quote out of context. He is translating Hebrew literature, restored Synagogues and is
establishing a Jewish Museum. He rescued the torah scrolls and has the symbols of the three religions appear together
in Video Clips, Pictures and documentaries about Egypt.
For these, and similar reasons, the fundamental — Terrorists are against him and are the ones working hard to block his
election.

Still working this through, but here is where we are thus far:
The majority of all countries that have direct presidential elections use a Two-Round system. The number appears to be
at least 58.
France, most Latin American countries, all five post-Soviet Central Asian republics, and many countries in francophone
Africa use TRS to elect their presidents. Elsewhere in Africa the system is used by Angola, Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana,
Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Sao Tome and Principe, the Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Sudan,
Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe; in Europe, apart from France, it is used by Armenia, Azerbaijan, Austria, Belarus,
Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Finland, Georgia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia
and Ukraine; and it is found in Afghanistan, Haiti, Indonesia, Iran, Timor-Leste and Yemen.

Odds On the Big A <http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/09/odds-on-big.html>

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759646 Date: 06/30/2015
Even as Governor Paterson reportedly has his recommendation on the Aqueduct racino in hand (this reader says
that he actually has two to consider <http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/09/sunday-morning-notes-and-
nuts.html#comment-1156672372250588546> ), at least one of the bidders is still taking its case to the local community
around the track. The Queens Chronicle reported last week
<http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=20368289&BRD=2731&PAG=461&dept_id=574908&rfi=6> that SL
Green/Hard Rock made a presentation on Thursday.
"Hard Rock is the right balance," [Pres/CEO Marc] Holliday said. "Its recognized brand and quality entertainment
will attract younger and older players across the stratum. People flying in from JFK will say, 'I hear there's a Hard Rock, I
want to see it."
One of this group's big pitches is that they'll be the first to generate a revenue stream ("shovel-ready, in the
ground, the day after the award.")
And thanks to the reader who alerted us to this article in Crain's
<http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20090913/FREE/309139964> which, more importantly than comprising yet
another virtual press release for Steve Wynn, contains, towards the bottom, a handy pocket guide to the six bidders, the
financial portion of their bids (or at least what is known about them), and the ups and downs of their proposals.
This is a tough call; handicapping without the Form as I said before. I can't say I have a favorite; neither a
particular personal preference, nor a clue as to the most likely winner. But I'll give it a shot and take the Crain's piece
one step further by coming up with a morning line.
<http://1.bp.blogspot.com/yiJ1ri4LCfk/Sq2_nTNU jI/AAAAAAAABHM/UucITWnkilM/s1600-
h/dont_bother.jpg> Aqueduct Entertainment Group <http://www.aqueductentertainment.comk (3-1): Competitive bid
of $251 million (contingent on 7,650 machines; $301 million with 10,000), a plethora of local connections on the real
estate/construction side, and approval by local unions could compensate for the lack of brand name recognition of
gaming partner The Navegante Group. Presence of Senator Malcolm Smith's longtime confidante Rev. Floyd Flake
doesn't hurt either.
SL Green/Hard Rock (4-1) - Boosted its bid to $275 million, and has the Hard Rock brand name as mentioned
above. Manhattan-based realtor SL Green has been endorsed by several local unions
<http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3601/is_43_54/ai_n27894917/> . But, as mentioned by Crain's, they were
passed over in favor of Delaware North the first time around.
Aqueduct Gaming (6-1), Buffalo-based Delaware North's group, has rallied late with a stepped-up publicity effort
and a major community initiative <http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/08/back-in-game.html> after appearing
indifferent early on (though it's original $100 million upfront offer remains intact with an additional $200 million to
follow). The addition of Harrah's <http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Aqueduct-Gaming-L1c-1034906.html>
adds an experienced operator and an interesting cross-marketing twist which is probably not allowed under the now-
disappeared MOU. And, like the two bidders above, Aqueduct Gaming has been reported to have reached
accommodations with the unions. So I listed them as the third choice on these merits. However, a part of me wants to
list them as the rank outsider - I'd be pretty damn shocked if the state goes back to the company which dropped out
after failing to raise the money last time. And, as I've mentioned several times, given the reports of an investigation
<http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/05/01/2009-05-

General Andrew Cuomo into lobbyist Patricia Lynch's dealings with the Assembly Speaker, I don't know if her
involvement here is going to help or hurt.
Steve Wynn (8-1) has offered $300 million, but he was the only bidder of the six contenders to receive a bad
grade from the hotel unions <http://www.timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storylD=838256&category=STATE> as

reported by Jim Odato in the Times Union last week. Whatsmore, the scale of his building proposal
<http://www.queenstribune.com/news/1250798405.html> is laughably ridiculous, and it wouldn't be ready until 2011.
He'd be the favorite if the decision is based on the number of newspaper and online articles
<http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/08/all-wynn-all-of-time.html> each bidder has been featured in. But, quite
simply, he sometimes comes off as a nut
<http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/cindy_adams/wynn_hopes_to_win_racefor_race_hzqJ384wLxUSxFKsUWiSyM> .
Penn National (12-1) might be worth a ducat at long odds. No local connection here makes them a dark horse.
But a $250 million bid (as reported elsewhere <http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/17717/penn-national-
lobbies-up/> though not in the Crain's piece) puts them in the ballgame, and the company is an experienced gaming
operator with a solid balance sheet
<http://www.businessweek.com/investor/content/aug2009/pi20090814_742719.htm> which would probably do as
competent a job as anyone else.
R. Donahue Peebles/MGM Mirage (20-1) didn't increase its $150 million bid, and doesn't have a lobbyist; good
luck with that. Whatsmore, no local flavor and MGM Mirage has had some well-publicized financial woes (though things
have been looking up of late <http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125212120561188377.html> ). Would be a major
surprise.

Re: Branch Book
Overview:
There are few surprises in this book. The "surprises" that might exist are buried and took a close reading to pick up on—
the two main ones are about the terror clause of WJC's crime bill and why he hadn't disclosed information about
Lewinsky (because he hadn't wanted to become a witness against her). There are a lot of things that have been covered
in My Life and other publications. Quite honestly the book was pretty boring and much more focused on Branch than I
had anticipated. While not as "and this day, and the next day" as My Life, it does share many of the same elements that
would engage only a true Clinton fanatic or historian. The fact that there appears to be no index also makes it difficult
for anyone looking for a quick hit to get one. Furthermore, WIC's words are so interlaced with Branch's recollection
through his dictations, that the number of direct WJC quotes was far fewer than I had expected.
HRC was not as much of a player as one might imagine. Her role is largely seen through her interactions with Branch
when he is recording WJC. Her statements were consistent with the past, with the exception of the Gephardt comment,
and didn't grab much attention at all.[1] (Others included HRC's devotion to CVC, thought that there should not be a
special prosecutor and images of her returning from meetings. They were pretty much aligned with her interactions with
Branch.) Surprisingly, or not surprisingly, many of the problems discussed in the book are those, which face the current
Administration—Middle East peace, North Korea, China, etc...
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
Branch repeatedly injects his feelings on specific subjects and seems to use the book to voice his own opinion of the
Administration and events of the time. He clearly has topics he prefers over others (for example his connection with the
events in Haiti result in a lot of discussion about it), but there are some subjects that are strikingly sparsely discussed
such as Rwanda. Its absence from long discussions was surprising, but it did not appear as thought WJC ever-dodged
questions about the topic, they just weren't addressed. Much like My Life, one theme that repeated itself was WJC's
conflict with and disdain for the media, especially long passages about NYT and Washington Post. There are a few
instances where gives them credit on their reporting, but you would be hard-pressed to find them. Additionally, there
are numerous mentions of WJC's acute allergies and his chronic fatigue, with imagery of him falling asleep in sessions on
more than a couple occasions.
The book has quite a bit on Whitewater, but given the dearth of public documentation there is little that Branch could
write that hadn't been said. One thing I had not recalled was the D'Amato's subpoena of CVC's friends, later quashed,
who slept over while NBC's Rose Law Firm records were in the White House. Branch does portray a helpful distinction in
how WJC looked at Whitewater and other scandals. While WJC attacks Whitewater as a political hunt, Branch does have
him WJC saying that Filegate needed to be separated from Whitewater, because this was a legitimate inquiry. There are
some quips that could catch someone's eye, such as WJC referring to Paula Jones as "a 'new bimbo' he [WJC] didn't
even recognize."
Branch does not dwell on Lewinsky or the impeachment. With the exception of Bruce, Bennett and Kendall, no other
lawyers are mentioned. There is one passage that I am looking into, in which WJC says part of the reason he didn't
mention his relationship with Lewinsky at first was because she was being threatened with jail time if she was found to
be lying under oath and had he told the truth he could become a witness against her. This is a very small passage that
could easily be missed, but one that it is important to note as I don't recall hearing this before. (This is addressed more
fully below.)
There are a few relationships that track through the book more than others. They include WJC's relationship with Gore,
which maps in part because it is not a focal point until the end, and his contentious relationship with Janet Reno. The
one Senator that appears to be most discussed negatively is Moynihan. All three of these issues are discussed in turn
below. WJC is portrayed as an extremely loving and attentive father and HRC is portrayed in a much more human light
than other books/articles covering this time period, with ample mention of her relationship with CVC and images of
affection between her and WJC, both pre- and post-impeachment.
On foreign relations there is a lot of time spent discussing the Middle East, Northern Ireland, the Balkans, China, Russia,
Pakistan/India and in the beginning of the book, Haiti. (Note: Much of what is written about Haiti is about Branch's own
experience there and on the subject.) There is also a fair amount of discussion about North Korea, but nothing that has
not been discussed in the past few weeks. Bin Laden is discussed in what seems to track mention of him in My Life,
which seems to have more detail and background than this book.
In certain cases there is more detail here than in My Life, for example on his trip to Pakistan WJC wrote that the USSS
cancelled one stop because they would be "defenseless" flying in, whereas Brach writes that the streets would be lined

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
with "assassins." There are candid looks at WIC's take on certain people and the relationship between some, such as
Albright and Berger's dislike of Holbrooke, and a more detailed depiction of Yeltsin's drinking, such as yelling outside of
Blair House for a cab to get pizza.
One thing to note, is that often times WJC seems to be speaking to Branch intentionally without the recorders going, but
Branch writes about those interactions and exchanges nonetheless. Such is the case with HRC's Gephardt comment.

Wen Ho Lee and Terror Clause of Crime Bill 4

11
Wen Ho Lee and Terror Clause of Crime Bill
In discussing Wen Ho Lee's release Branch characterizes WJC's lack of knowledge about the strained interpretation of
the anti-terrorist provisions in the crime bill and arbitrary detentions as a "confession." My Life only mentions Lee's
accusation in passing and does not again discuss Lee. Below are two passages from Branch's book the first giving context
and the second about the Terror Clause of the Crime Bill.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
0 The year closed on spies and terrorism. The Justice Department, after fierce debate among the security agencies,
indicted nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee on fifty-nine counts of copying classified material to his personal computer. Lee
was being handled like a radioactive espionage defendant—no bail, lockdown, solitary confinement—even though the
long dragnet had produced no evidence that he offered secrets to China or anyone else. The president said experts were
telling him the worst spies sometimes stored their treason for a rainy day. This sounded fishy to me. Clinton shrugged.
Nothing would please him more than to establish Lee's innocence. [Branch, 577]
0 While Lee was indicted, Branch writes that WJC noted that others "were being held in secret, uncharged and
untried...He [WIC] was embarrassed not to have sponsored this measure into law without foreseeing such arbitrary
detentions...Under the terrorist act, any prosecutor should decide within the legal limit...whether to bring charges on the
testimony of a secret informant or otherwise. To his dismay, Clinton had learned of defendants held incommunicado for
more than six months. One extreme detention had last three years. 'I think it's wrong,' he [WJC] said. 'It's not American.
We accept guilty people on the street to enjoy and protect our freedom." [Branch, 629]
WJC and Lewinsky's Silence
Branch writes that part of WJC's motive for not discussing what had happened with Lewinsky was that it could send her
to jail, as she had denied it.
0 "Also, he pointed out that Starr had been threatening to jail Lewinsky all year over her sworn denial of the affair. If
Clinton had come forward with anything at all about their relationship, he said Starr could have turned him into a
witness against Lewinsky, betraying her discreet silence. Such subtleties, while original, struck me as tendentious. The
president never claimed chivalry as the real motive for his steadfast denial, nor did he dispute the essential truth of
Lewinsky's account." [Branch, 511]
HRC and Kissinger
The following could be fodder for people who want to continue to string along the notion of channeling Eleanor
Roosevelt.
0 There is a passage in which HRC describes an exchange she had with Kissinger at a dinner where he complained that
if the health care bill passed he wouldn't be able to see his own doctor. She continued to say "it was interesting, in fact,
that she had dreamed about Kissinger only a few nights before. His visage turned suddenly effervescent at a banquet,
announcing gladly that his worries were over because the Clinton health care bill was dying. 'Oh, no, Dr. Kissinger,' she
replied coolly. 'Don't be sure that it's dead. We'll keep fighting, and there's always light at the end of the tunnel.' She
said Kissing blanched, speechless at her deft reminder of the Vietnam War...Now at last, in Hillary's dream, it registered
that his strategic designs had spewed carnage and venom for seven needless years...'That's what I dreamed,' Hillary
repeated, lost in thought. 'You know, I always get my revenge in dreams, but never in real life." [Branch, 179]

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
HRC and gay/lesbian
Writing about a call with HRC from NYS, Branch recalls how W1C's counsel got very "exercised." WJC left the room. "He
was subdued on his return. 'You know, I've had a lot more contact with gay people in my life than Hillary.' He sighed. Her
temperament had a conservative, religious core, formed before homosexual issues were even mentionable. New York
politics was a tough crucible, and she was unsure what heat she could take. On the other hand, personal experience
could speed adaptation." [Branch, 551]
Tension with Moynihan
There are several occasions throughout the book that Branch recalls WJC's grievances and frustration with Moynihan.
For example:
0 When Moynihan called for the international arms embargo to be unilaterally lifted so that Bosnia could fight for
themselves, Branch writes, "The president flinched when I mentioned [it]...'That's just a freebie for him,' snapped
Clinton, 'and he knows it." [p.140]
0 In regard to health care: "Echoing comments by Hillary at dinner, he [WIC] faulted Senator Moynihan for aimless
hearings conducted without a strategy or theme." [p.170]
0 Discussing Independent Counsel: "She [HRC] was especially scornful of the Democrats, and quoted a number of
them. Senator Moynihan, for instance, publicly said the Clintons were nice people and he was sure they had nothing to
hide. 'Why not have an investigation?' he often asked. She said Moynihan skated blithely on the surface, never
produced results in Congress, and could not withstand such scrutiny himself for five minutes, living in an apartment
secured through his chairmanship of the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation." [Brach, 182]
0 "Donnybrook" argument in which Moynihan said of a fundraising speech WJC gave citing a regretted hypothetical
about a controversial decision. Moynihan told the press, "He doesn't understand...that he's conceding the principles."
WJC confronted him about lack of context given to the statement to the press and said that Moynihan knew what he
was doing by "feeding the beast of hostile presumption about Clinton's motives." [Branch, 299]
HRC as World Player
There are several images as HRC as a player on the world stage, both with WJC and on her own. Several examples
follow:
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
0 Middle East: Discussing peace with King Hussein: "They had retreated for lunch as two couples—the Clintons, with
the king and his wife, Queen Noor—in the family dining room...Their agenda was a delicate race between Hussein's
failing health and his desire to make peace with Israel. The president said he and Hillary pounded away on symptoms of
national estrangement: closed boarders, water disputes, travel barriers, war grievances, contested airspace, sealed
electrical grids, and so on. Hussein gave them a feast of goodwill without commitment on any point." [Branch, 170]
0 South Asia: Regarding her trip to South Asia with CVC in 1995, "Her [HRC's] schedule was far more demanding than
ceremonial, pushing both conflict resolution and civic empowerment for downtrodden women." [Branch, 236] Later
Branch tells of Benazir Bhutto praising CVC and HRC. "By contrast with a superficial American press, which portrayed
Hillary as a demure tourist of no policy significance in exotic Asia, Bhutto said she had touched essential political chords
with whirlwind encouragements for citizenship groups and small-scale economic development." (The note contrasting
Bhutto corresponds to a NYT article which Branch quotes in the footer saying, "she [HRC] played the traditional role of
First Lady as wife and mother...") [Branch, 246]
0 China Speech: Branch outlines how HRC felt the speech needed to be bigger than China and how she depicted the
"harsh reality everywhere" from China to Africa. He then cites WJC commenting on the rave reviews of HRC's speech.
[Branch, 289]
0 Regarding the Russian financial system meltdown, Branch writes "Yeltsin seemed so removed from urgent political
tasks that both Clintons counseled him directly." [Branch, 512-513]
Jesse Jackson
Branch writes about Jesse Jackson calling CVC after the Lewinsky story broke and having continued contact with her
throughout the period. WJC thanks him for his support of CVC. This goes into some detail about WJCs gratitude, but the
fact that Jackson "counseled" CVC has been public knowledge dating back to at least 1999.
0 "But now Jesse had done something he would not forget. When the Lewinsky news broke, he called Chelsea at
Stanford. Jesse was the only nonfamily adult with her cell phone number. How he got it was another story. Jesse said he
knew this was terrible for her. Nothing like it had ever happened in American politics. He did not know everything
involved, but he wanted to remind Chelsea how much her parents loved her. Their family needed to stick together now
above all, and if she needed to counsel, rage, or pray, he was always available." [Branch, 497]

Throughout the book, from his nomination of her, WJC is portrayed as having no opinion to having a negative opinion of
Janet Reno.
0 "He complained about Janet Reno—made it clear, in fact, that he felt alienated from his own attorney general. If he
removed her, however, the pending decision on yet another special prosecutor [for 1996 campaign finance] would fall
to Reno's deputy, Jamie Gorelick, who, Clinton feared, may share Reno's wholesale devotion to outside control for any
case in which the president himself may become a target...lf he removed both Reno and Gorelick, to start fresh, it would
touch off a firestorm of protest like Nixon's Saturday Night Massacre of the Justice Department officials during the
Watergate scandal. That was not an option." [Branch, 388-389]
0 Branch writes about WJC talking about Reno and Louis Freeh disregarding a letter from D'Amato and continuing to
allow independent counsel to go after Ciseneros. The same held true for Mike Espy. Branch then outlines a meeting
between WJC and Reno. Reno had made public statements about her "desire to stay on the job. 'I told her I didn't like
that one damn bit,' the president said tersely. 'I didn't hire her to work for the New York Times and Washington Post. I
hired her to work for me." [Branch, 398] He continues to outline that Clinton did give Reno credit for some good
achievements including coordination with U.S. attorneys and that he didn't blame her for the special prosecutor on
Whitewater, but that "he did blame her for abdicating responsibility to supervise the investigations ever since, letting
mandates multiply almost at will. She accepted criteria that were ludicrous and crassly partisan. Reno had failed to
defend the presidency itself—not Clinton personally, but the institution—and by extension the entire executive
branch...He told me she had no clue what he meant. His advisers considered her more naïve than upright, and the
fuzziness of the distinction seemed to save her." [Branch, 399] He cites that Clinton warned her that she should prepare
herself for not staying in the job for the entire second term.
Portrayal of Jimmy Carter
There are parallels that could be drawn between WJC/BHO and Carter/WJC both in terms of Carter's trip to North Korea
and the mission he went on to Haiti. WJC clearly was frustrated by Carter's seeming desire to be on the front lines.
North Korea:
0 "On North Korea, he [WJC] said Jimmy Carter had initiated his own recent trip with a call to Al Gore, and Clinton had
approved the volunteer mission to break through North Korea's extreme isolation...Sure enough, Carter did reach North
Korean dictator Kim II-sung, who proposed to allow inspection of North Korea's nuclear facilities in exchange for relief
from the harsh economic sanctions. The only hitch was that Carter announced the terms on CNN before they became
official, adding gratuitously that he never had agreed with sanctions in the first place. News stories had the White House
seething, but Clinton made light of the spat. He said the deal was since ratified by an exchange of letters, and he did not
believe Carter would criticize official policy 'if the game were still in doubt." [Branch, 1621

0 After pushing to be sent to Haiti and enlisting Colin Powell and Sam Nunn to get WJC to break with Gore (who said
Carter shouldn't be trusted a second time) and Christopher and approve the mission to Haiti to seek a truce with the
junta, Carter is portrayed as acting stubbornly and having 'clientitis' (arguing for acceptance of Haitian generals versus
what was in the United States' best interest). He didn't want to leave and WJC told him he had to. Like after North
Korea, Carter again, Carter went to the press first. "The three negotiators flew back to Washington late Sunday, and
Carter, invited to stay over at the White House, called CNN's Judy Woodruff after midnight to arrange an interview the
next morning before he reported to Clinton on his mission. This conduct, the president said tersely, was not right...The
press was full of retrospective stories about friction between him and his three prominent negotiators... He said the
current newsweeklies lapped up criticism by Carter as an embarrassment to Clinton...Many of his advisers griped that
Jimmy Carter thought he was still president, but Clinton found this criticism too jaundiced. Carter had spoken with
restraint at their joint press conference, he allowed, exhibiting a keen political ear...To Clinton, Carter simply felt that he
had earned the right to speak his mind as an international statesman, even about a mission he had accepted for the
United States government complete with an Air Force jet. This sense of entitlement could make Carter a thorn, but
Clinton thought his value far outweighed the political annoyance. He considered Carter a sterling ex-resident." [Branch,
200-201]
Dispatch of Bombers Near Iraq
0 "He expected military strikes to win bipartisan assent, including former presidents Ford, Reagan and Bush. 'Dole will
support me,' he said. 'Carter will probably criticize me. Carter always criticizes, but he doesn't have much positive to
say." [Branch, 518]
Gore
For the majority of the book, there is little discussion of WJC and Gore's relationship. There are few places where he is
briefly mentioned and a couple of scenes with some levity. The end, however, describes the seemingly brutally candid
conversation between the two about the 2000 election and the impeachment.
0 On page 92 Branch writes, "No, he [Clinton] did not ask Gore to take over a failed foreign policy, as alleged, but to
improve public presentations by his troika of 'bad talkers': shy National Security Adviser Tony Lake, boring Secretary of
State Warren Christopher, and disorganized Defense Secretary Les Aspin." [Branch, 92]
0 In one-passage WJC talks about asking Gore to lead the independent review of Hazel O'Leary and also having Gore
substitute for him at an economic conference in Japan. The latter did not fare well as other nations were offended that
Gore, not WJC attended. Gore insisted that WJC needed to go to Japan to redeem himself and the administration for his
absence. Gore pointed to a few days in January, but WJC "pronounced them vital to Chelsea's schoolwork. Gore blinked.
So what?...Mutual exasperation spiked. 'Al,' Clinton told him, 'I am not going to Japan and leave Chelsea by herself to
take these exams.' Gore erupted. He thought Clinton had lost his bearing. They had a big fight, said the president, and
were still wrangling about dates for Japan." Branch states that this fight wound up being around the time WJC saw
Lewinsky. [Branch, 316-317]

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
0 On page 396-397 there is a scene, which shows Gore's sense of humor and Gore, WJC, et al working as a team to
secure the Cabinet for the second term.
0 Later there is a passage about an exchange between WJC and HRC about Gore trying to hire a second criminal
lawyer. HRC already knew he was paying the first one $30,000 per month. The conversation is about a leak of an offer
from Jim Neal of TN, the former Watergate prosecutor to defend Gore for free. The exchange is more on ethics of the
offer and its leak to the press than about Gore.
0 On Gore's announcing his campaign. "The president had called twice to congratulate Gore for his kickoff events—
once from Geneva, hours later from Paris. Clinton thought the only glitches were technical...But Gore got all the big
things right. His twofold message was perfect: distinguish himself from Clinton's personal flaws, and tell voters exactly
what he would do for them in the White House. The president said it was fine for Gore to call Clinton's affair with
Monica Lewinsky 'inexcusable.' First, it was true. Second, it showed a necessary strength to criticized the boss. Third,
Gore would be badgered to death until he did. 'Al,' Clinton told him, 'if you thought it would help in the campaign, I
would let you flog me at noon right on the doorstep of the Washington Post." [Branch, 553-554] Branch continues that
WJC told Gore to ignore reporting that he was offended or critical of his campaign. "On tape, the president said he
confided his chief strategic worry only to Gore himself and to Gore's pollster, Mark Penn. The vice president must
project his platform—where he stood, precisely how and where he would lead the country—because the Republicans
would try to knock him off substance." [Branch, 554]
0 WJC offered critiques of Gore's campaign throughout, but it was always framed as his fear of Gore not succeeding
him. For example, "Clinton still thought Gore could win. Most people considered him smart, experience, and motivated.
He examined the pitfalls for Gore in a campaign showcasing presidential character over detailed agendas for the
country. Reporters called Gore "stiff," but Clinton discounted this liability. He thought Gore's droll sense of humor would
wear well over time. Gore also was perceived to be too conventional a Democrat, therefore lacking independence,
which called for Gore to emphasize more his own passion and initiatives. Then the president said Gore could have a
brooding quality about him, not worrisome or off-putting in itself, but potentially damaging if his serious nature failed to
give voters a lifted. Clinton isolated the word "sunny." Gore needed more of it." [Branch, 599]
0 He also complimented Gore's knowledge of government workings. "Gore knew Washington. Believe me, said the
president, his administration would have made many more errors in the first two years had it not been for the vice
president." He then goes on to say that WJC suggested Gore find someone who would be a bright spot to run with,
perhaps Durbin or Bradley or Kerrey, although he also goes into great detail about the virtues of Mikulski, even though
she would never get chosen. How much of this was WJC's emphasis versus Branch's focus on his home state senator is
unclear. [Branch, 599, 618-19]
0 WJC criticized Gore for not running on the successes of the administration. "They should be running essentially for a
third term, said the president, but they were afraid the Clinton-Gore record would tarnish them with Clinton's
character." [Branch, 623] Branch gives WJC's critique of Gore in debate that had been heard before—that Gore lacked
style and a light touch.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
0 Branch has WJC recalling a conversation between WJC and Gore where "Gore had bared himself in one of their
stressful consultations by insisting that he, Gore, was a good politician, elaborating that he meant good on the policy,
and also good on the politics, but admitted that he did not instinctively blend the two. Gore said he had to think about
it, and Clinton thought this was pretty close to the bone...He had the stuff to be a great president, and this was the
message that Clinton must convey somehow without seeming to brag on his own record." [Branch, 623-624]
0 The big passage about Gore begins on page 641 and extends to 645. Branch notes that WJC was unsure at first
about recording the details. At the outset it says, "For his own part, Gore was not angry, nor did he blame Clinton for his
defeat, but he wanted to acknowledge forthrightly that some people around him did." [Branch, 642] It has WJC
acknowledging that Gore's use of him was proper—he was best in the White House. Then he says, "I think you made a
mistake not to use me more in the last ten days," Clinton told Gore, 'but otherwise that was not a big deal. I was much
more upset about your message, now that we're being honest." [Branch, 642] Branch recalls WJC saying Gore fought
bag saying that "Clinton's drag plagued every direction." Clinton then said that Gore was better at governance than
Clinton, and Gore would be better for the nation than Bush, and that he was an "unparalleled" vice president, but that
he had "blind spots." Branch writes that WJC kept saying their confrontation was "surreal."
o Gore had a "fresh grievance...he wanted Clinton to know that the Buddhist temple fund-raising scandal had been
the worst experience of his life. No one had ever questioned his personal integrity, but corrosive publicity and whispers
had tormented him now for four years. Gore said he had not been disposed to blame Clinton. However, he remembered
telling the president that he found himself the only English-speaking person at one of those Asian fund-raisers. And the
president was in charge of the party apparatus that was supposed to screen all the donations for trouble. So he did
blame Clinton in a way. The president told me he could scarcely believe the ensuing tales of suspicion. Gore must still be
in shock from the election, or unhinged. 'I thought he was in Neverland,' he said." [Branch, 643-644]
o Branch continues: "The vice president asked Clinton about Monica Lewinsky. He had supported Clinton all through
the impeachment, publicly and privately, while declaring himself disappointed. Yes, said the president. He appreciated
that. However, persisted Gore, Clinton did not confide any personal feelings. He never explained exactly what happened.
There was little to say, Clinton replied, beyond failure and regret. He was humiliated and angry, had made mistake. He
had misled the American people, and he was sorry. Gore closed his point with emphasis. Well, he said, this is the first
time you have apologized to me personally. Clinton did a double take...Gore treated the confession as a watershed.
Their colliding perspectives made both of them angry. Clinton exploded that Gore's reaction was phony. What was so
significant here?...Gore exploded back. He was feeling a stubborn repeat of the defensiveness and delayed honesty that
somehow cost the election. Clinton's character was at the root of it..." [Branch, 644-45]
Other
0 Maggie as Person Recommending Panetta: Unlike in My Life, in Branch's book, it has WJC asking Maggie to compile
confidential suggestions for McLarty's replacement. "Williams was shrewd, discreet, and efficient." [Branch, 161]
HRC and Haiti Invasion: Branch asked WJC what HRC thought about his foreign policy team's suggestion to invade
Haiti. "He said the pell-mell rush to invade was crazy to her. Reacting against the pressure, the lack of options, and his

sense of being trapped, she said he was badly served by his foreign policy staff. He said she observed with some
suspicion that the chief sponsors of the invasion—Lake, Berger, and Talbott—were the same people who had pushed
the ill-fated appointment of Bobby Ray Inman as defense secretary." [Branch, 189]
0 ITAV: ITAV co-author flap in which Sally Quinn spread rumors that HRC had not written the book. Quinn said that
HRC had denied credit to the book's collaborator, Barbara Feinman, a friend of Quinn. HRC said Feinman had withdrawn
from the project. Branch notes that the White House had draft chapters in HRC's handwriting. (Branch turned this to be
about him and how it affected him as a ghostwriter.) From this HRC said that Quinn and her friends launched a rumor
that HRC and a female veterinarian of Socks' were "discovered...in flagrante on a bedroom floor in the White House."
[Branch, 342-343]
0 Subpoenas of CVC's Friends: Branch tells of how D'Amato, as Chair of the Banking Committee, had subpoenaed all
those who might have been in the White House when HRC's Rose firm records were there. This included "some two
dozen of Chelsea's sleepovers." Senator Sarbanes quashed the subpoenas for the sleepovers. [Branch, 362]
0 Vernon Jordan Extramarital Sex: In the context of Lewinsky, Branch says of Vernon Jordan, "In our glancing
associations, I had picked up from Vernon an attitude toward extramarital sex best described as lighthearted or
recreational." [Branch, 495]
0 Gore/HRC ticket: "By the numbers, and Clinton's gut, a Gore-Hillary ticket would give Democrats their best chance
to defeat Bush for the White House. 'Hands down,' he [WJC] said, 'but I don't think Al would ever do it." [Branch, 540]
WJC suggesting Rubin run for NY Senate seat: The passage comes after WJC talks about supporting HRC if she
decided to run, which raises a question of whether he had preferred Rubin or whether the two events are unconnected.
"When the president had urged him [Rubin] to run for and easily win the New York Senate seat, Rubin recoiled...He .
could not fathom why Hillary wanted to run now..." [Branch, 557]
0 On trip to South Asia: Branch says that WJC agreed to cancel a stop in Bangladesh, because "of hard intelligence
that Osama bin Laden had lined the route with assassins." [Branch, 594] My Life discusses the cancelled trip but does
not specify it was because of bin Laden or assassins.

Let's speak when you have time.
Rep. Joe Wilson's Rebel Yell
Inside the racist klavern that Joe Wilson joined By Max Blumenthal
Since Republican Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina bellowed at President Barack Obama, "You lie!" during the
president's nationally televised speech on healthcare, the fourth term backbencher has emerged as a hero among the
conservative grassroots. One of the most enthusiastic endorsements of Wilson's histrionics came from the Sons of
Confederate Veterans (SCV), a group that Wilson has <a href=http://crooksandliars.com/david-neiwert/obama-heckler-
joe-wilson-member-neo>belonged to</a> for several years.
"Mr. Wilson, never apologize for allowing your love of truth to overrun your desire to be polite," the SCV Tea Party <a
href=http://scvteaparty.com/?p=165>declared</a> on its website. "It is the liar who must apologize, not the one who
identifies the liar!"
Who are the SCV? A once-proud organization of Confederate history buffs and re-enactors who spent their
organization's money to restore Civil War-era battlefields and Confederate cemeteries, by 2006 the SCV was
substantially <a href=http://www.spIcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?pid=1027 >taken over</a> by an organized
cadre of white supremacist radicals (read <a href=http://www.spIcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?pid=154
>here</a> for more background) who sought to turn the nation's oldest Southern historical society into what the
veteran white supremacist activist Kirk Lyons called "a modern, 21st century Christian war machine capable of uniting
the Confederate community and leading it to ultimate victory." When the racist junta had seized much of the SCV's
leadership positions, the Southern Poverty Law Center released an <a

href=http://www.spIcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?sid=90 >extensive list</a> of SCV officials who belonged to
"hate groups."
Lyons, a key leader of the white supremacists who took over the SCV, had <a
href=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20050829/blumenthal/single >harbored dreams</a> of creating a seemingly
benign front group for a more sophisticated version of the Ku Klux Klan. "I have great respect for the Klan historically,
but, sadly the Klan today is ineffective and sometimes even destructive," Lyons told a German neo-Nazi magazine in
1992. "It would be good if the Klan followed the advice of former Klansman Robert Miles: 'Become invisible. Hang the
robes and hoods in the cupboard and become an underground org anization." With the SCV, Lyons discovered he didn't
have to go underground after all.
Once Lyons helped install his close friend, Ron Wilson, as president of the SCV, the organization's political newsletter, <a
href=http://fpacscv.org/southernmercury/ >The Southern Mercury</a> (where Wilson served as senior editor),
transformed into a propaganda mill for crude white supremacist cant. Mailed to all dues-paying members of the SCV —
presumably including Rep. Joe Wilson — until it went defunct in 2008, the Mercury has published articles describing
blacks as genetically inferior to whites, calling African-Americans as "a childlike people," and warned that if Obama runs
for re-election, race riots of an "exceedingly violent nature" would immediately ensure, leaving "entire sections of some
of our cities in ruins."
Here are a few highlights from the Southern Mercury:
"After the turn of the 20th century, the white Southerners had disfranchised and segregated the blacks, in perhaps the
mildest reaction possible at=2 Othat time to the blacks' transgressions. The blacks — then a childlike people — had been
selling their votes to the Democrats en masse for $.25 apiece in national elections."
—"Where We Stand Now, And How We Got Here," by Frank Conner, Southern Mercury, September/October 2003
"Previously, anthropologists had routinely recorded the notable differences in IQ among the races; but at Columbia, a
liberal cultural anthropologist named Franz Boas...decreed that there were no differences in IQ among the races, and the
only biological differences between the blacks and whites were of superficial nature... Meanwhile, the liberals in the
media heaped special praise upon black athletes, musicians, singers, and writers — and treated them as typical of the
black race. The liberals were creating a false image of the blacks in America as a highly competent people who were
being held back by the prejudiced white Southerners."
--Conner, September/October 2003
"It is very clear to me that if Barack Obama should be elected President, he would be extremely anti-white and would
demand reparations for slavery and press hard for affirmative action to the degree that it would hurt young whites who
were seeking jobs or admission to College and Graduate Schools."
—
"Americans Face The Worst Presidential Candidates In History," by Robert Slimp, Southern Mercury, May/June 2008
"I believe that [Obama's] rhetoric and anti-white legislative proposals would stir up racial riots. If he were running for re-
election, these riots would turn into an exceedingly violent nature that would seriously damage race relations in
America, and leave entire sections of some of our cities in ruins."
--Slimp, May/June 2008
Rep. Joe Wilson could have resigned from the SCV as soon as the organization's takeover by open white supremacists
began. But he didn't. Or he could have withdrawn his membership when the SCV's flagship journal turned into a racist
rag. But he didn't. Instead, while serving as a state senator, Wilson led an SCV-inspired campaign in 2000 to keep the
Confederate flag flying above South Carolina's state capitol. "The Southern heritage, the Confederate heritage, is very
honorable," Wilson <a href=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/503579.stm>proclaimed</a> at the time, responding
to critics of the Confederate flag.

I sought an appointment with the Prime Minister to brief her on our problems,
at the advice of the US ambassador in Dhaka. But it is now over six weeks,
her office never responded.
Almost every important person in Bangladesh congratulated me for receiving
the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Prime Minister and her party said not

So you can see the depth of the problem.
I thought I should keep you briefed and let you figure out what to be done.

A New Approach for Missile Defense
By Hillary Clinton
Iran's development of short- and medium-range ballistic missiles poses a clear and growing threat to the security of our
European allies and our own forces stationed in the region. That is why President Obama announced yesterday that the
United States is ready to deploy missile defenses in Europe specifically geared toward stopping these missiles. This is a
threat we cannot ignore.
Previous missile defense efforts have focused on protecting against intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching
the United States, but our intelligence now shows that the threat from these long-range weapons has not progressed as
quickly as had been feared. In contrast, evidence indicates that Iran is developing short- and medium- range missiles
that will eventually enable it to target most of Europe, the Caucuses and the Middle East, including U.S. and NATO
forces.
We deeply appreciate the willingness of the Czech and Polish Governments to host the original missile defense
architecture on their soil, and the decision to deploy other systems to better meet this growing threat came as a result
of a long and careful review of our policies, capabilities, and requirements. This decision does not alter the unshakeable
commitment of the United States to the security of these vital NATO allies. Rather, it reflects our determination to
jointly meet the threats that endanger us all.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759705 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759705 Date: 06/30/2015
The old focus on long-range missile defense systems left significant gaps in our ability to defend against shorter-range
threats, exposing our allies and our forces stationed in Europe. Many experts have also expressed concerns about the
testing record and effectiveness of the long-range interceptors that were to be deployed in Poland.
Our new approach is different in a number of ways.
First, we will use well-tested missile defense systems, such as the Standard Missile-3, against the current threats. And
unlike the old fixed, silo-based interceptors, they will be mobile and able to shift as threats evolve.
Second, while previous efforts sought to by-pass NATO in favor of bilateral agreements, the Obama Administration plans
to make coordination with NATO a central element of our approach. By working with our allies to build a workable and
cost-effective missile defense system in Europe, we can better contribute to the protection of our NATO allies and
increase regional stability.
For 60 years, the NATO alliance has been a force for peace, prosperity and security in Europe and around the world
because of its commitment to collective security: an attack on one ally is an attack on all. An attack on London or
Warsaw is an attack on New York or Washington. NATO demonstrated this commitment after the September 11
terrorist attacks, when for the first time, the alliance invoked Article V and NATO sent assets to the United States to help
protect us from additional terrorist attacks.
Unfortunately, the old long-range defense plan created the impression of "two-tiers" of security within the alliance by
focusing only on theoretical threats that could one day affect the mainland United States, while leaving our European
allies vulnerable to very real short- and medium-range missiles.
Our new plan corrects this imbalance. We will continue to monitor and counter longer-term threats, but we will work
with our allies to protect all NATO territory. We will focus on the most imminent threat, while also developing the
capacity to adjust quickly if the threat evolves.
Finally, we will engage with Russia as part of our new approach. Russia is also vulnerable to Iran's short- and medium-
range missiles and we will seek to cooperate to address this common threat. I am pleased that the Russians agreed at
the Moscow Summit to a joint threat assessment of the ballistic missile challenges of the 21st century, including from
Iran. This is a positive first step and I look forward to future progress.
In short, this new missile defense plan is more realistic about the threats we face, more reliable in the tools we will use,
and more inclusive of the allies we are pledged to protect.
While we pursue this new path, we will also redouble our diplomatic efforts to engage Iran and focus its leaders on a
clear choice: whether to join the international community as a responsible member or to continue down a path to
further isolation.
But the security of our allies and our forces cannot wait. That is why we are moving ahead with a new approach for
missile defense.

WASHINGTON (Wall Street Journal) - The White House will shelve Bush administration plans to build a missile-defense
system in Poland and the Czech Republic, according to people familiar with the matter, a move likely to cheer Moscow
and roil the security debate in Europe. The U.S. will base its decision on a determination that Iran's long-range missile
program has not progressed as rapidly as previously estimated, reducing the threat to the continental U.S. and major
European capitals, according to current and former U.S. officials.

Heads up. Richard invited George to go on one of his recent AfPak. I endorsed it as did the White House because George
is a first-rate journalist. Obviously Richard strayed shall we say from discussion of our strategy. It ends up being a semi-
profile on Richard. I'll alert the WH. I don't see anything here that is problematic for the Secretary, but I don't know that
every detail here is correct.

Dear Mr. Crowley,
The New Yorker Magazine is going to press with George Packer's article on Richard Holbrooke. George briefly mentions
Secretary Clinton in the piece. I am fact-checking the piece and want to make sure our information is accurate. If you

1. Secretary Clinton told George Packer that the Administration was coordinating diplomatic and development and
defense efforts much more closely than it had before.
2. In 1996, Secretary Clinton encouraged her husband to name the first female Secretary of State.
3. Last year at the transition headquarters at the Hilton Hotel in Chicago, Obama asked Hillary Clinton about
possible candidates for the the position of Secretary of State.
4. Clinton recommend Holbrooke to Obama.
5. A few days after Obama offered Clinton the position of Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton called Holbrooke to
offer him the job that is now called Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan.
6. In late November, HRC and Holbrooke talked for three hours at Essex House, in New York, about the job.
7. Early on, Clinton told Holbrooke that he would be the civilian counterpart to General David Petraeus.
8. Clinton introduced Holbrooke to Petaeus.
9. Holbrooke initially told Clinton that he would need around 15 staff members in his department.
10. Holbrooke told HRC last fall that he would prefer the title Special Representative to Special Envoy.
11. Holbrooke and Clinton often speak several times a day.
12. On April 23rd at 4 pm, Clinton, Donilon and Holbrooke met the President at the Oval Office.
13. In the hallway, fifteen minutes before the meeting began, Holbrooke gave Clinton and Donilon a memo written
by his staff member, Vali Nasr.
14. Clinton read the memo in the hallway.
15. Clinton gave a copy to the President after they walked into the Oval Office.
16. Holbrooke has praised Clinton's idea of tapping the Pakistani diaspora. She has urged Pakistani-American
doctors, especially women, to volunteer in the refugee areas.

After much back and forth, the speech does not affirmatively indicate our willingness/openness to explore talking about

other subjects in addition to the nuclear file, but that you should not state that affirmatively.

Hello Melanne,
Well the list of 5 continues to be a Quizomba dance (a bit forward, a bit backward).
On the positive.
The two, Mosala and Pitchen, that had been commanders in Kimia II, have finally been changed. They are
supposedly in route to Kinshasa.
That means none of the 5 are now in active operational command position.
This is positive.
All 5 are supposedly in Kinshasa, but not yet confirmed. 2 are in the central prison in Kinshasa.
On the negative.
None of the 5 have been charged. 2 are arbitrarily detained.
More negative.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759743 Date: 06/30/2015
We received attached request•this week for support to investigate the cases of the 5 officers. While only about
$70,000, the request is strange and worrying. In 4 of the cases an open file in North or South Kivu military prosecutors
office exists. Only in the case of should the Military Prosecutor General need to be involved, given the B6
rank of the suspect.
In all 5 cases the local military prosecutor had opened a legal investigation and had interviewed all the victims.
The cases were stopped by political or financial intervention. Now the request indicates the Military Prosecutor General
needs to fly all over the country to investigate. Not only is the request 18 months late in coming, it makes no sense. In 4
of 5 cases, the military prosecutor in the Province has jurisdiction. They just need to continue their work. With the
suspects all in Kinshasa, it makes their work more difficult.
Is someone trying to make some money? Were they given the impression that the international community is
so interested in this case, but the government is not? Or is there so little trust in the local prosecutors that central
government wants more control? Or do governmental officials know so little about how criminal cases function that
they are inadvertently delaying procedures.
Conclusion. Lobby has been effective to remove from position of active command. Political intervention has not
had desired impact in terms of judicial action.
To be continued.
Have a good weekend.

FYI: We will send today for your review and approval a demarche describing the circumstances in which the U.S. would
walk out of speeches at the UN General Assembly and asking countries to join us in the walkout. Note that we are
differing from past practice when we simply did not have anyone in the U.S. seat during speeches by certain countries.
This year an appropriate-level individual will be behind the U.S. placard for all speeches and will remain unless these
redlines are crossed.
This demarche is going out to EU member state capitals, as well as Oslo, Reykjavik, Ottawa, Canberra, Wellington, Tokyo,
Seoul, Buenos Aires, Bogota, San Jose, and Montevideo. USUN asks that our posts deliver the demarche in advance of an
EU political directors meeting on this issue in New York Monday morning our time.
The background portion,of the cable, which discusses EU internal dynamics on this issue, is classified, but the
unclassified talking points will come to you for your review.

Huma, Joe, Jake,
We are likely to have one candidate against Hosni in round 4 of the UNESCO director general race on Monday.
EU Commissioner Ferraro-Waldner has pulled out formally.
Our UNESCO Amb. Killion reports that candidates Baki (Ecuador) and Bukova (Bulgaria) met Sunday night Paris time.
Baki has given Bukova an ultimatum. Either they form a unity ticket with Ivonne Baki on top or Baki leaves the race.
Tonight former Ferrero-Waldner supporters are considering how to vote. Mexican Dep Secretary for 10 issues called
me. They are wondering whether to support Baki in round 4 now that F-W is out.
I noted that we wanted the strongest of the ladies to stay in (Fyi, they both were on our list of the most qualified
candidates.) Too early a pull out could also affect the race.
The Egyptian candidate could lose because of a consolidation of alternative candidates.
I am sorry to report that the Egyptians have used harsh tactics in the halls of UNESCO. A member of the U.S. delegation
has seen a member of the Egyptian-hired "public relations" group walking around with an envelope of cash. They
pushed to have two Amb recalled. Disgust and resentment is running high.
The Egyptians are pushing delegations very hard. FM Aboul-Gheit has stopped in Paris to deal with the UNESCO race
while en route to NY for UNGA.
A/S Feltman writes that Egyptian Ambassador Shoukry has called him twice todaY with a "message from the Foreign
Minister." FM Aboul Gheit is angry and reports President Mubarak is angry.

A/S Feltman notes" maybe we've become a convenient excuse." A/S Feltman very helpfully pushed back and helped
defend our ambassador who had been criticized.
Our strategy relies on our Amb being low-key. He is following his instructions. We should be unhappy with the way he is
being attacked personally. Candidates Bukova and Baki are moving ahead on their own lobbying. FYI, Hosni even said
on French TV that the U.S. is neutral reflecting our especially low key approach this past week. Now that Hosni may
lose, the U.S. looks like a convenient one to blame.
Events will continue to develop among the candidates and voting delegations. The Monday 9am Paris time Europeans'
meeting could indicate Bukova's relative support and offer a chance to reveal any Baki-Bukova deal if there is one.
Meanwhile Egyptian pressure is likely to continue at UNESCO on Monday.
Monday's vote is midday EDT.

Apparently you can't get away from me. We're sharing the FT op-ed page tomorrow. Here's my piece....
Thanks again for Friday. Much favorable comment. Good luck at the UNGA.
President Barack Obama's announcement of a new system for protecting America's allies against Iranian missiles has
ignited charges that he is scaling back the one he inherited from George W. Bush as a concession to the Russians.
In fact, the Obama plan is a big improvement on the Bush one, and it is designed to counter an evolving Iranian threat,
not to mollify Russian anxieties.
Mr Bush's decision to put 10 missile interceptors in Poland and an associated radar in the Czech Republic was based
on a concern that Iran was developing long-range rockets that could hit the US. The Bush system would have been less
effective against shorter-range Iranian missiles, and it would have left much of Europe, notably including America's ally
Turkey, unprotected.
Over the last several years, the Iranians have shifted their efforts from developing a few long-range rockets to
deploying large numbers of shorter-range ones that pose an immediate danger to southeastern Europe and the Middle
East, as well as to US forces stationed there. Unlike Mr Bush's, Mr Obama's plan will quickly field a missile-defence
capability to address an existing threat. It can be upgraded to deal with longer-range Iranian missiles in the future.
The Central Europeans who have reacted to the decision with apprehension or alarm should recognize that the
replacement of a conceptually flawed plan with a more credible one strengthens the bonds of transatlantic defence.
The view from Moscow has been clouded by outright paranoia. Military experts there suspected that the US rockets
in Poland, while advertised as defensive, could be used offensively, even pre-emptively, against Russia. Laying to rest
that far-fetched scenario was not the prime motivation for Mr Obama's decision, nor should it have been. However, by
removing what has been a gratuitous irritant in bilateral relations, the president has improved the prospects for US-
Russian arms control negotiations now underway in Geneva.
Those talks could produce by December a new treaty reducing numbers of strategic — that is, intercontinental —
weapons. If ratified by the US Senate (which will not be easy, given the ferocity of the partisan wars in Washington), the
US and Russia will be on track for further reductions in the future. Mr Obama and Russian President Dmitri Medvedev,
who are due to meet in New York this week, have jointly called for the eventual goal of eliminating nuclear weapons.
As they and their successors take steps in that direction, they will have to grapple with a stark paradox of the nuclear
age: mutual deterrence depends on each side being vulnerable to retaliation from the other. If either side has enough
defences to trump the other side's offence, the mutuality of deterrence breaks down and one or both sides will be on
hair-trigger, making war more likely in a crisis.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759768 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759768 Date: 06/30/2015
American statesmen pounded this inescapable truth into the heads of their initially sceptical Soviet counterparts 40
years ago. The result was the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty signed by Richard Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev in 1972. By
limiting the defensive capability of both superpowers, the ABM treaty was a necessary companion piece to a series of
treaties setting ceilings on offensive weaponry. Because nuclear weapons were expected to with us forever, the ABM
treaty was meant to last in perpetuity.
While the Soviets were converted to the logic of restricting defence, Ronald Reagan was not. The late US president
championed the development of a space-based comprehensive shield that would make offensive weapons — and
therefore mutual deterrence —"impotent and obsolete."
Many experts believed Reagan's vision, which they derisively nicknamed Star Wars, was an impossible dream. So did
his successor, George H. W. Bush, who treated the program with benign neglect while negotiating with the Russians in
the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START) begun by Mr Reagan.
The second president Bush reversed his father's policy. He greatly weakened the START process, pulled the US out of
the ABM treaty and sought to revive a national missile defence (NMD) system. His decision to build the interceptor and
radar sites in Poland and the Czech Republic was, as one of his aides told me at the time, in large measure about
"pouring concrete for what will eventually be a global NMD."
Key officials of the Obama administration — including the president himself, who studied arms control in college —
understand the linkage between reduction of offences and regulation of defences. However, they have avoided raising
that issue in the context of last week's decision. That is partly because they want their plan to be judged on its own
merits, vis-à-vis the Iranian threat. But it is because they have more than enough fights with the Republicans without
further energizing the right wing by trying to reinstate the principles of the ABM treaty.
Yet sooner or later the US administration will have to grasp the nettle of regulating strategic defences. Otherwise,
continued reductions in strategic nuclear offences will be either impossible or, worse, dangerous.

Cheryl,
had a second meeting with Amb. Sussman on Friday, in which the Ambassador told
overqualified for the position he envisions.
According to Amb. Sussman was extremely complimentary of her, stating she was very well-respected across
the board and everyone he spoke with about her had nothing but wonderful things to say. However, he said he'd be
embarrassed/feel bad about asking her to do 85% of the tasks he envisions for this role (Amb. Sussman's job description
for the position is below, so you can see why he'd say this).
said they left things on very good terms with the Ambassador stating he wants them to maintain a relationship
and asked her to get back in touch with him in 6 to 7 weeks. He also made a vague, and somewhat odd, reference to
her possibly volunteering or working on a contract basis down the line at the embassy. In addition, he made a call to
nominate her for a position on the while she was sitting in his office.

does not want Amb. Sussman to think that she is at all unhappy with the way she was treated. He seems to put
a lot of thought and deliberation into this decision given how long he has drawn out this process and how many people
he spoke with about her. agrees that she would probably be overqualified for the position that he envisions,
however, she also feels that he is not using this position to its fullest potential and value.
Right after I got off the phone with the desk officer for London called to ask who the appropriate person was for
Amb Sussman to contact regarding staffing. I said you - so you will likely get an email from the Ambassador about this

I would keep her posted on our end.

Dear Melanne:
I am drawing your attenrtion to the following report in the leading daily
newspaper in Bangladesh. All other papers carried the same news.
This is a report on the Prime Minister Hasina's speech on the floor
of the parliament. High-lighted section of the report refers to me
without naming name but giving her usual description of me.
See if you can find a way to clear her mind of all the terrifying thoughts
she has about me. I invite you to be a peace-maker! Otherwise it will become
explosive for nothing. PM Hasina is coming to NY for General Assembly
meeting, and will have a meeting with Sec H during her visit.
See you soon.

Prime Mnister Hasina Warns
The Daily Star, Dhaka, September 17, 2009
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday alerted the countrymen to the
ongoing conspiracy of 'special quarter' and 'undemocratic forces' who are
still plotting to wipe out democracy and grab the seat in power after
being failed to capture it.
The prime minister, however, urged the Leader of the Opposition and BNP
Chairperson Khaleda Zia and her allies to return to parliament for raising
their voices.
Recalling her experience as the opposition leader, Hasina said, "We used
to walk out from parliament sessions, boycott it but we used to return to
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759784 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759784 Date: 06/30/2015
the House again."
Meanwhile, the parliament session was adjourned till 4:00pm on October 4.
Sheikh Hasina, also ruling Awami League (AL) president, urged people to keep vigil against recurrence of incidents like
BDR mutiny to reverse the democratic strides. She also urged the people not to be misguided by any 'false campaign.'
"While running the government and doing development works, we find continued obstacles in every step from the
'special quarter', benefited by undemocratic government, who earlier had captured power through undemocratic
means, So, I urge the countrymen to be cautious so that the democratic trend continues," she told the parliament.
The prime minister was speaking at a discussion titled 'democracy and political tolerance' on the occasion of the
International Day of Democracy.
Following an hour long discussion, the House passed a resolution by which Bangladesh will also observe the
International Day of Democracy through holding a discussion in the parliament every year.
Inter-Parliamentary Union decided to observe September 15 of every year as International Day of Democracy in the
context of a resolution adopted by the United Nations in 2007.
The International Day of Democracy was first observed in 2008 but Bangladesh could not observe the day as unelected
caretaker government ruled the country during that time.
Referring to the sugar price, Sheikh Hasina told the House that a big conspiracy is going on regarding sugar price. Price of
sugar is being raised though stock of sugar is available. "We are investigating the matter and action will be taken against
those who are responsible for it,"
said the Leader of the House.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759784 Date: 06/30/2015
On plotting of the conspiracy, Sheikh Hasina said people who wanted to sit in power without election are still hatching
conspiracy against her government.
Pointing out the two years of the past caretaker government, Hasina said, "Various formulas were floated during that
time by those who would lose security money if contest any election."
She also disclosed in parliament that many proposals were given to her
(Hasina) during that time including offering her the status of a prime minister without participating,in elections, which
she rejected.
Without mentioning any name, the prime minister said, those who wanted to capture power by creating new political
parties are still continuing their activities to capture power.
"Those persons who had failed to float a new political party, exploit
people, get huge interest from poor people and remain in disguise of good
men wearing good dresses are still busy hatching a conspiracy against the
government," said Hasina, who was sent to a makeshift jail during the
anti-graft drive of the past caretaker government.
She, however, hailed the caretaker regime for holding a free and fair election, which she claimed as the best election
since 1973.
The AL Chief Hasina told lawmakers that the country has been pushed back economically, socially and culturally by
applying the undemocratic and military rule while only a special quarter became rich but the majority people remained
ignored.

The premier vowed that her government is committed to materialise all its election pledges to fulfil the desire of the
people.
Hasina said her party believes in the definition of democracy given by Abraham Lincoln who said Democracy means--by
the People, of the People, for the People.
"But this democracy has been absent in the country since 1975 when the military ruler grabbed power throwing an
elected government," she said.
AL leaders Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, Suranjit Sengupta, Abdul Latif Siddiqui, Advocate Fazle Rabbi Mia, Abdul Matin
Khasru, Bangladesh Workers' Party President Rashed Khan Menon, among others, took part in the discussion.

Somalia faces worst food crisis in 18 years: UN
(AFP) – 1 day ago
ROME — Drought, conflict and displacement are causing the worst humanitarian crisis in war-torn Somalia in 18 years,
the UN food agency warned on Monday.
Some 3.6 million people, about half the Somali population, need emergency aid including 1.3 million people displaced by
fighting in the Horn of Africa country, the Food and Agriculture Organisation said in a statement.
Around 1.4 million Somali farmers face a severe drought, while some 655,000 poor urban dwellers face high prices for
basic food staples, the FAO said.
Hundreds of thousands of Somalis have fled their homes over the past three years of violence involving hardline Islamist
movements and many more in total over the country's 18 years of almost uninterrupted civil chaos.
Hunger also stalks other countries in east Africa and the Horn of Africa region, the UN agency said.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759795 Date: 06/30/2015
The number of people depending on food aid in the region -- currently nearly 20 million -- "may increase as the hunger
season progresses, particularly among marginal farmers and low-income urban dwellers," the FAO said.
"Below-average rains combined with conflict and displacement are aggravating an already serious food insecurity
situation in the region," it said.
An added element is El Nino, a weather phenomenon associated with floods, droughts and other climatic disturbances,
the FAO said.
"The effects of El Nino, which usually brings heavy rains towards the end of the year, could make matters worse, ...
destroying crops both in the field and in stores (and) increasing livestock losses," the statement added.
Continued low purchasing power is also threatening food security in the region, the UN agency said.

The aid business in crisis. The past year may have been tough for the world's richest countries, but it has been far harder

the intellectual attack on aid has escalated, led by the author of "Dead Aid" <http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-
dyn/content/article/2009/04/02/AR2009040203285.html> , the African economist, Dambisa Moyo.
The CGI has become the showcase for those who believe Moyo is wrong and that aid can be effective. The CGI is not
about the old government-to-government aid model. Its members aim to deliver smart aid, based on partnerships
between business, philanthropists, and social entrepreneurs. Mrs. Clinton's speech is the perfect opportunity to show
that government is ready to work with the CGI crowd to rethink how it does aid.
One promising, for-profit solution to poverty is to take the model of microfinance -- one of the more resilient corners of
banking during the financial crisis -- and extend it to improve education, health care, clean water and sanitation. Loan-
based investments can be more sustainable than traditional aid or charity, because they tap the far larger sums available
in the capital markets and are not dependent on the whims of political leaders or budgetary wrangling. Some in
government may be reluctant to give up their near monopoly on aid but it is long overdue.
A second opportunity is to get the public more involved in the aid business. New giving organizations such as Kiva
<http://www.kiva.org/about/how> have demonstrated how the public can play an effective role in allocating money to
needy people <http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/06/AR2009070603594.html> .
Government should be doing all it can to encourage his type of mass philanthrocapitalism that levers the generosity of
the American people and taps into the wisdom of crowds. It is time for government aid to be made more democratic by
letting Kiva and others like it distribute some of the tax dollars.
Finally, Mrs. Clinton should seize the opportunity to turn the aid business on its head and pass control from the
bureaucrats to the poor people themselves. Technology such as the internet and the mobile phone are now widespread
in the developing world, so why not use these tools to give a greater voice in aid spending to the people the money is
intended to help? Much aid has gone to waste because of a lack of feedback from the intended beneficiaries. Imagine
how the best technology entrepreneurs could transform the aid business, in the same way that they have changed the
media, by giving the poor a say in how the aid billions are spent.
The Obama Administration has made all the right noises about making government smarter by working more with the
philanthrocapitalists. At home, the creation of a White House Office of Social Innovation
<http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Obama-to-Request-50-Million-to-Identify-and-Expand-
Effective-Innovative-Non-Profitsh was a welcome first move, yet it is still to be seen whether this will amount to much
more than a new source of grant funding for the nonprofit sector. The big win is in remaking government through
innovative partnerships with the private sector. Mrs Clinton has been mulling over what to do with USAID for nearly a
year. What better opportunity than the CGI to announce a bold new strategy for smart aid?

Dear Cheryl:
We in London are extremely excited for Secretary Clinton's visit. Hopefully if you join her we will have a few minutes to
get together. The purpose of this e-mail is to bring you up to date on my decision regarding the potential employment
of as my Schedule C assistant. I met two times with and the meetings confirmed everything
you said as to her capabilities, intelligence and personality. My conclusion at the end of the meetings was that
was so overqualified for the position we need to fill. It would be like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole and it
would end up not working out for either of us. Our needs are 80% administrative, evidenced by our position description
which is attached.
I believe that understood my difficulties in attempting to have a Special Assistant with her skills. That being said,
I definitely want to use her capabilities and create a relationship not only personally, but with the Embassy in the future.
I have appointed her to which she was very excited about. I am in the process of
looking for special projects in the Embassy and to make introductions to major corporations who may be able to use her
skills in the private sector. I am attaching her e-mail to me, which speaks for itself.

For Secretary Clinton
Dear Hillary,
You will remember our initiative to bring the most senior retired generals from the Chinese and US militaries. With
these 10 generals from the two countires, I am going to be in DC on October 21 and 22. these Generals have been part
our of our Sanya Initiative - the unofficial mil-mil dialogue I started last year. It'll be me, Joe Prueher, Charley Wilhelm,
Ron Fogleman, and Denny Reimer. The Chinese will be led by General Xiong Guangkai and include four other very senior
and respected Generals from the PLA.
The Chinese view this as a formal track one program and take it very seriously. We will meet with ADM Mullen and ADM
Keating in Honolulu and see GEN Cartwright at the Pentagon. It would be a terrific sign of the U.S.'s support for this
relationship if you were able join or host (I'd be pleased to fund) a very private dinner on the evening of the 21 or the
22nd of October. Just you, the Generals, and interpreters - perhaps the Chinese Ambassador if you think that would be
valuable.
I met with Kurt Campbell last month, and we will meet with him and Jim Steinberg. He expressed strong support for this
dialogue as well as the economic one we started in Beijing last August. You know we would welcome involvement from
State at any of our projects - our goal is to make a small but meaningful difference in the relationship.
Warm best wishes, (I'm cheering for you!)

Secretary Clinton,
Just wanted to make sure that you saw the news about one of China's oil conglomerates and the Iranian National Oil
Company over the
weekend:
Iran, China sign a major oilfield deal, Mon, 28 Sep 2009 15:05:09 GMT China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) has signed
a contract with National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) for the development of Iran's South Azadegan oilfield. The Chinese
company will buy a 70 percent share of the whole project, according to an agreement signed Sunday in Lausanne,
Switzerland between CNPC and NIOC's overseas investment subsidiary, Naftiran Intertrade Company (NICO) that covers
a 90 percent stake in the project.
A likely explanation would be that this deal has been long in the making. Still, Tehran's motivation for releasing this
information in English at this time is worth considering.
The whole story from an English-language Iranian outlet is pasted in below, and I found three Chinese-language sources
with corroborating reports (nothing in English from China, though):

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759850 Date: 06/30/2015
CNPC, which won a bid in January to develop the North Azadegan oilfield, now holds a 70 percent share of the project
with NICO holding 20 percent, and lnpex of Japan having the remaining 10 percent.
The South Azadegan project is slated to produce 260,000 barrels of crude oil per day, and its development will cost
around $2.5 billion.
The field, along the Iraqi border, holds reserves estimated at approximately 42 billion barrels of oil, one of the world's
largest finds in the last 30 years.
Iran provides 14 percent of China's demand for oil.
The deal is couched in buy-back terms, in which CNPC will hand over the operation of the field to NIOC after
development and will receive payments from the oil production for a few years to cover its investment.
China's investment in Iran's energy sector has increased as some western countries, led by the US, have sanctioned Iran
over its peaceful nuclear program.

(Congo). I tried to line her up to be a speaker at the Global Summit that Hillary attended, but we were unable to book
her due to scheduling issues. She's not some random, run-of-the-mill aid worker; she's really, really special, having set

Subject: Suggested letter for follow up to Mrs Clinton's visit to HEAL Africa
This is Lyn Lusi writing to you from HEAL Africa in Goma and your address comes from the business card you left me
when you visited us. You may have heard that Secretary of State Mrs Clinton and Ambassador Ms Verveer came to
HEAL Africa on Tuesday 11th August. The visit went very well, and the organisation was impeccable, so she could
achieve her objectives. While in our Conference Centre, she announced a package of aid to Congo to fight Gender Based
Violence.
First she congratulated HEAL Africa on the excellent work we are doing; then she announced a deal between the US and
the Norwegian Government to build a state of the art fistula and teaching hospital in Goma.
She must have been aware of the shock and discouragement of all our staff. In effect she was saying:
"Your excellent work is not really excellent at all, and we will work with the Norwegians to replace you in North Kivu."
I seriously believe she was not properly briefed, because of some remarks she made as she was leaving.
This is now a request to you, and if possible, other members of the your organisation, if you would be so kind as to
contact them. Nothing is set in stone, and politicians respond to pressure from their friends and constituencies. We
believe that wise use of funds means building capacity among local organisations that have already proved that they can
do the work, and sustain their efforts, rather than starting something new.
I am attaching below a letter like the one we have written to Mrs Clinton and a similar one to Ambassador Verveer. If
you think it is appropriate, we are requesting you to write a similar letter to both of them. We are hoping that local
Congolese organisations will not be excluded from these resources to build local capacity on the foundations of what is
being done already.
With kind regards.

SUGGESTED LETTER
Secretary of State Mrs Hillary Clinton
U.S. Department of State
2201 C Street NW
Washington, DC 20520
Goma, 11th August 2009
Dear Mrs Clinton,
If We ..... followed with interest reports of your visit to Goma on 11th August 2009, where you convened a meeting of
Congolese actors in the fight against Gender Based Violence at HEAL Africa training center. The commitment of the
people of the United States to working alongside Congolese associations for peace and human rights is heartening, after
16 years of endless war.
We congratulate you for this pioneering visit which gave a voice to Congolese community based organizations, who are
often overpowered by international actors. We sincerely hope that the US government and USAID will take the next step
in working alongside community based organizations in Eastern Congo.

After studying the announcement of the package of assistance that is being prepared to contribute to fighting Gender
Based Violence in the east of Congo, we are mystified to hear that the United States and the Norwegian government
have decided to build for North Kivu a centre of excellence for training doctors in fistula repair and care of mothers.
According to good development principles, outside assistance builds on what is already in place and functioning well,
developing proven capacity and giving local actors the additional tools they need to do a better job.
As friends and supporters of HEAL Africa for many years, we know that this hospital has pioneered fistula repair in North
Kivu and Maniema provinces since 2002, when no one else was interested in caring for women with fistula. They have
four experienced surgeons trained in Addis Ababa fistula hospital, and have performed over 1600 fistula surgeries. HEAL
Africa has a wide network of community based workers to identify and support patients coming and returning. HEAL
Africa's surgical teams perform outreach surgery in North Kivu and Maniema provinces in local general hospitals, linked
at the same time with in-service training of local staff, and referring only the most complicated cases to Goma. These
services are recognized by reputable agencies since the United States through IRC, through UNICEF and through
Engenderhealth, has invested in HEAL Africa staff, equipment and infrastructure over the past five year. The Spanish
Embassy has supported HEAL Africa's prevention of fistula initiatives over the past four years, through their wide-
reaching Safe Motherhood program, working through local associations of mothers-to-be for maternity insurance and
access to safe deliveries.
HEAL Africa has a clearly defined place within the government medical system of North Kivu where they are recognized
as the tertiary referral hospital of the province. Thus they are a recognized clinical training centre of the Medical Faculty
of the University of Goma, offering the first two years of accredited clinical specialization in Pediatrics, Obstetrics and
Gynecology, Family Medicine, Surgery and Orthopedics.
HEAL Africa is a Congolese not for profit association which has completely rebuilt itself after total destruction by the
volcano, with assistance from many friends in USA and around the world. They have a state of the art surgical suite, but
the buildings hastily erected in the aftermath of the volcano are inappropriate for the quality of care they wish to offer
to patients: they deserve better.
We wish to request that the State Department give assistance to HEAL Africa to increase the quality of their services and
training capacity through the newly announced package of financial aid. We would like to ask you to fund the
construction of the three storey building which is the final stage of reconstruction of the hospital after the catastrophe
of the volcano in January 2002. The second floor of this building will be entirely devoted to women's fistula services;
and the whole hospital is devoted to teaching and preparing Congolese doctors to give excellent service in the most
underserved areas of Congo.
Many visitors from the US Embassy in Kinshasa, from USAID in Washington and Nairobi, the Secretary General of the
United Nations Mr Ban Ki Moon, Ms Rice from the Security Council, US senators and deputies, and a great number of
aides from your government have visited HEAL Africa and have come away enchanted by a hospital of excellence run
entirely by Congolese staff of the highest caliber. They are hoping that, through your visit, you will be able to advocate

Here is what we have come up with as agreed language from Bob, Eric, Mike, Melanne, Lissa and me. This can be used
for the letter and for press guidance. Melanne will send a letter to the GOSL and perhaps the UN Permrep. We will ask
the Post to release the letter to journalists in Colombo once it is received. I will schedule a press briefing at the Foreign
Press Center early this week, which will attract a good number of Asian journalists, and make sure the question is asked
so we can put it in proper context. We will have it for guidance in the Main State briefing if asked. PJ
BEGIN TEXT
Questions have been raised regarding remarks by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on September 30 before the United
Nations Security Council on the adoption of a resolution to combat sexual violence in armed conflict. In her statement,
she said that we have seen rape used as a tactic before in a number of countries, including Sri Lanka.
Regarding the Secretary's reference to Sri Lanka in her address, we want to be clear. Over the course of the difficult
conflict between the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), stretching into this
decade, the State Department as well as credible human rights organizations reported numerous cases of rape and
sexual violence in Sri Lanka, particularly acts committed against women held in detention by the government. This was
the basis for the Secretary's statement. At the same time, in the most recent phase of the conflict, from 2006 to 2009,
though we remained deeply concerned about reports of extrajudicial killings, disappearances and mistreatment of
detainees, we have not received reports that rape and sexual abuse were used as tools of war, as they clearly have in
other conflict areas around the world. We hope that this clarification puts the issue in its proper context.
These questions should not detract from the specific actions that Sri Lanka needs to take now. With the end of the
military conflict, Secretary Clinton believes strongly that Sri Lanka must focus to the future and move forward on the
promotion of peace and the protection of human rights. The government of Sri Lanka should release more than 250,000
displaced persons who are still confined in camps, and lead a process of genuine political and social reconciliation. The
United States stands ready to assist and support the people of Sri Lanka with these critical challenges.

Gynecology, Family Medicine, Surgery and Orthopedics.
HEAL Africa is a Congolese not for profit association which has completely rebuilt itself after total destruction by the
volcano, with assistance from many friends in USA and around the world. They have a state of the art surgical suite, but
the buildings hastily erected in the aftermath of the volcano are inappropriate for the quality of care they wish to offer
to patients: they deserve better.
We wish to request that the State Department give assistance to HEAL Africa to increase the quality of their services and
training capacity through the newly announced package of financial aid. We would like to ask you to fund the
construction of the three storey building which is the final stage of reconstruction of the hospital after the catastrophe
of the volcano in January 2002. The second floor of this building will be entirely devoted to women's fistula services;
and the whole hospital is devoted to teaching and preparing Congolese doctors to give excellent service in the most
underserved areas of Congo.
Many visitorsirom the US Embassy in Kinshasa, from USAID in Washington and Nairobi, the Secretary General of the
United Nations Mr Ban Ki Moon, Ms Rice from the Security Council, US senators and deputies, and a great number of
aides from your government have visited HEAL Africa and have come away enchanted by a hospital of excellence run
entirely by Congolese staff of the highest caliber. They are hoping that, through your visit, you will be able to advocate

Here is what we have come up with as agreed language from Bob, Eric, Mike, Melanne, Lissa and me. This can be used
for the letter and for press guidance. Melanne will send a letter to the GOSL and perhaps the UN Permrep. We will ask
the Post to release the letter to journalists in Colombo once it is received. I will schedule a press briefing at the Foreign
Press Center early this week, which will attract a good number of Asian journalists, and make sure the question is asked
so we can put it in proper context. We will have it for guidance in the Main State briefing if asked. PJ
BEGIN TEXT
Questions have been raised regarding remarks by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on September 30 before the United
Nations Security Council on the adoption of a resolution to combat sexual violence in armed conflict. In her statement,
she said that we have seen rape used as a tactic before in a number of countries, including Sri Lanka.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760037 Date: 06/30/2015
Regarding the Secretary's reference to Sri Lanka in her address, we want to be clear. Over the course of the difficult
conflict between the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), stretching into this
decade, the State Department as well as credible human rights organizations reported numerous cases of rape and
sexual violence in Sri Lanka, particularly acts committed against women held in detention by the government. This was
the basis for the Secretary's statement. At the same time, in the most recent phase of the conflict, from 2006 to 2009,
though we remained deeply concerned about reports of extrajudicial killings, disappearances and mistreatment of
detainees, we have not received reports that rape and sexual abuse were used as tools of war, as they clearly have in
other conflict areas around the world. We hope that this clarification puts the issue in its proper context.
These questions should not detract from the specific actions that Sri Lanka needs to take now. With the end of the
military conflict, Secretary Clinton believes strongly that Sri Lanka must focus to the future and move forward on the
promotion of peace and the protection of human rights. The government of Sri Lanka should release more than 250,000
displaced persons who are still confined in camps, and lead a process of genuine political and social reconciliation. The
United States stands ready to assist and support the people of Sri Lanka with these critical challenges.

U.N. asks Afghanistan to lift election media ban
KABUL, Aug 19 (Reuters) - The United Nations has asked Afghanistan to lift a last-minute ban on media reporting of
violence during Thursday's presidential election, saying the Afghan constitution guaranteed a free press. Afghan
authorities imposed the ban on Tuesday with two decrees, the first barring journalists from reporting any violence in the
country between 6:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. (0130-1530 GMT) on polling day. The second ordered journalists to stay away
from the scenes of any attacks. The government says the measures are intended to prevent reports of violence from
scaring Afghans away from voting. Taliban fighters have vowed to disrupt the election.• The United Nations said Afghans
had a right to information, and restricting the media could undermine confidence in the poll. "People need access to
information, not only on polling day but after polling day. The credibility of these elections is directly linked to the
information that they have access to," said Aleem Siddique, spokesman for the U.N. mission in Kabul. "Its unclear to us
what if any legal basis there would be for such a directive when Afghanistan's constitution guarantees freedom of
expression and freedom of the press. We are making this point to the Afghan authorities," he said on Wednesday.
Afghan police have taken a more aggressive attitude towards reporters in recent days. Several journalists were beaten
by police at the scene of a suicide car bombing on Tuesday and a siege with gunmen on Wednesday.

The Secretary's Call Sheet for
Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari
Purpose of Call: To express your condolences regarding the deaths of Iraqi MFA personnel in the August 19 attack on
the Iraqi Foreign Ministry.
want to personally express my heartfelt condolences to you for the savage attack on the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign
Affairs today and for the tragic loss of so many Iraqi lives around Baghdad and particularly at the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs.
El I remember fondly our meeting at the MFA in April — I was proud to be the first senior U.S. official to attend a meeting
there, and I was deeply saddened to hear that your Ministry was attacked.
CI This is a trying day for Iraqis and the Government of Iraq, but brutal attacks like these only deepen the need for
dedicated Iraqi like you and those in your Ministry, to remain committed to the new Iraq.
0 Know that the United States will continue to stand by Iraq as it faces these challenges.
Background: On Wednesday, August 19, what appears to be a series of VBIED and additional rocket attacks in Baghdad
resulted in the bloodiest day in Baghdad since the June 30 withdrawal of U.S. forces from urban areas. Although exact
numbers have not been confirmed, media is reporting that approximately 75 people were killed across Baghdad with
over 100 injuries. The most devastating attack appears to have been against the Iraqi MFA, where a VBIED was
exploded in front of the main gate. Zebari's Chief of Staff estimated that there were 35-40 fatalities and up to 40
injuries resulting from this attack, with 70% of the building damaged. In April, you were the first senior U.S. official to
hold a meeting at the MFA. Deputy Foreign Minister Labid Abbawi, who attended your meeting at the MFA and who's
wife led your meeting with Iraqi war widows, was reportedly slightly injured and quite shaken by the attack. He may
have lost a number of staff members. At this point, we do not know if other senior-ranking MFA officials were killed or
wounded in the attack.

up the fistula hospital and teaching hospital in Goma with her husband, Dr. Jo Lusi. Lyn sent me this email and requested
I "do what I can" to encourage Hillary to empower the indigenous physicians and trained personnel in this hospital
rather than bring in outside partners to start something new.

Subject: Suggested letter for follow up to Mrs Clinton's visit to HEAL Africa
This is Lyn Lusi writing to you from HEAL Africa in Goma and your address comes from the business card you left me
when you visited us. You may have heard that Secretary of State Mrs Clinton and Ambassador Ms Verveer came to
HEAL Africa on Tuesday 11th August. The visit went very well, and the organisation was impeccable, so she could
achieve her objectives. While in our Conference Centre, she announced a package of aid to Congo to fight Gender Based
Violence.
First she congratulated HEAL Africa on the excellent work we are doing; then she announced a deal between the US and
the Norwegian Government to build a state of the art fistula and teaching hospital in Goma.
She must have been aware of the shock and discouragement of all our staff. In effect she was saying:
"Your excellent work is not really excellent at all, and we will work with the Norwegians to replace you in North Kivu."
I seriously believe she was not properly briefed, because of some remarks she made as she was leaving.
This is now a request to you, and if possible, other members of the your organisation, if you would be so kind as to
contact them. Nothing is set in stone, and politicians respond to pressure from their friends and constituencies. We
believe that wise use of funds means building capacity among local organisations that have already proved that they can
do the work, and sustain their efforts, rather than starting something new.

Dear Mrs Clinton,
I/ We ...... followed with interest reports of your visit to Goma on 11th August 2009, where you convened a meeting of
Congolese actors in the fight against Gender Based Violence at HEAL Africa training center. The commitment of the
people of the United States to working alongside Congolese associations for peace and human rights is heartening, after
16 years of endless war.
We congratulate you for this pioneering visit which gave a voice to Congolese community based organizations, who are
often overpowered by international actors. We sincerely hope that the US government and USAID will take the next step
in working alongside community based organizations in Eastern Congo.
After studying the announcement of the package of assistance that is being prepared to contribute to fighting Gender
Based Violence in the east of Congo, we are mystified to hear that the United States and the Norwegian government
have decided to build for North Kivu a centre of excellence for training doctors in fistula repair and care of mothers.
According to good development principles, outside assistance builds on what is already in place and functioning well,
developing proven capacity and giving local actors the additional tools they need to do a better job.
As friends and supporters of HEAL Africa for many years, we know that this hospital has pioneered fistula repair in North
Kivu and Maniema provinces since 2002, when no one else was interested in caring for women with fistula. They have
four experienced surgeons trained in Addis Ababa fistula hospital, and have performed over 1600 fistula surgeries. HEAL
Africa has a wide network of community based workers to identify and support patients coming and returning. HEAL
Africa's surgical teams perform outreach surgery in North Kivu and Maniema provinces in local general hospitals, linked
at the same time with in-service training of local staff, and referring only the most complicated cases to Goma. These
services are recognized by reputable agencies since the United States through IRC, through UNICEF and through
Engenderhealth, has invested in HEAL Africa staff, equipment and infrastructure over the past five year. The Spanish
Embassy has supported HEAL Africa's prevention of fistula initiatives over the past four years, through their wide-
reaching Safe Motherhood program, working through local associations of mothers-to-be for maternity insurance and
access to safe deliveries.
HEAL Africa has a clearly defined place within the government medical system of North Kivu where they are recognized
as the tertiary referral hospital of the province. Thus they are a recognized clinical training centre of the Medical Faculty
of the University of Goma, offering the first two years of accredited clinical specialization in Pediatrics, Obstetrics and
Gynecology, Family Medicine, Surgery and Orthopedics.

HEAL Africa is a Congolese not for profit association which has completely rebuilt itself after total destruction by the
volcano, with assistance from many friends in USA and around the world. They have a state of the art surgical suite, but
the buildings hastily erected in the aftermath of the volcano are inappropriate for the quality of care they wish to offer
to patients: they deserve better.
We wish to request that the State Department give assistance to HEAL Africa to increase the quality of their services and
training capacity through the newly announced package of financial aid. We would like to ask you to fund the
construction of the three storey building which is the final stage of reconstruction of the hospital after the catastrophe
of the volcano in January 2002. The second floor of this building will be entirely devoted to women's fistula services;
and the whole hospital is devoted to teaching and preparing Congolese doctors to give excellent service in the most
underserved areas of Congo.
Many visitors from the US Embassy in Kinshasa, from USAID in Washington and Nairobi, the Secretary General of the
United Nations Mr Ban Ki Moon, Ms Rice from the Security Council, US senators and deputies, and a great number of
aides from your government have visited HEAL Africa and have come away enchanted by a hospital of excellence run
entirely by Congolese staff of the highest caliber. They are hoping that, through your visit, you will be able to advocate
for the physical plant that will enable them to serve their patients even better than before, and train the next generation
of doctors in an environment where it is possible to practice excellent medicine.
We remain, respectfully,

ANGOLA TO RECEIVE $500 MILLION INVESTMENT FROM RUSSIA
(SBU) Russian state-owned mining company Alrosa will build homes, schools, and dams in addition to partnering with
Angola's petroleum company Sonangol on exploration, according to press. The Angola desk notes the investment occurs
as Angola attempts to diversify away from Chinese foreign investment. Embassy Luanda comments this is Russia's first
entry into the oil and gas sector. (Ops/Angola desk telcon, Ops/Embassy Luanda telcon, Reuters)

HRC:
Attached is the draft memo in its current state from the Holbrooke team (it does not yet include RCN's hand edits which
he just sent in).
As you will see, the beginning of this memo lays out 4 strategic interests, 3 of which overlap with the goals we discussed
in our conversation; the fourth goes to the international consequences of success or failure.
Assuming we go with the approach we discussed, a cover memo should work reasonably well with this document
(excepting the discussion on the foreign aid piece). See if you agree.
To actually see the document in its current form with showing edits — you need to print the attached version.
Below is the version that accepts all the proposed edits and eliminates the comments so you can read on BB if you
choose.

HRC: I wasn't satisfied by my answer to your question about how to gain leverage over the Pakistanis to move them to
more aggressively pursue AQ. I've thought about it some more and, while I have no silver bullet, here are some further
thoughts.
-- My impression is that the Pakistanis have been more cooperative lately in assisting us target some AQ in Pakistan and
that, where they hold back, it is less a function of affinity toward AQ and more about with whom AQ is imbedded..
-- In particular, they seem to be more reluctant to target AQ where it is nestled with groups they want to cultivate in the
event we "leave" Afghanistan and they need influence there. They have seen that before and will hedge their bets.
-- So the first point is that we have to address the reason why they are holding back. If we can disabuse them of the
perception that we are leaving Afghanistan, it will be easier to get the Pakistanis to go after AQ in sanctuaries provided
by groups which would be part of a future Afghanistan dominated by the Taliban.
-- Second, I believe that coercive measures are more likely to be effective if they are targeted against military leaders
who give support to AQ and its allies. Assuming we have adequate intelligence, we can go after bank accounts, travel
and other reachable assets of individual Pakistani officers, raising the stakes for those supporting the militants without
creating an inordinate backlash. Blunter measures of coercion, like conditioning our assistance, are more likely to be
counterproductive. Given the level of distrust for us among the Pakistani people, they would see this as another sharp
swing of the U.S. pendulum which would harden their attitudes and make greater cooperation very difficult for the
Pakistani people to accept.
-- There may be greater leverage in giving the Pakistanis incentives to be more aggressive. Of course, the military's
calculation is most important. I'm not sure what is on their shopping list these days but we would need to balance what
would move the needle on AQ against undercutting our effort to get them to shift their strategic focus away from India..
At the same time, we can be as forward leaning as possible in support of their counterinsurgency capabilities
(equipment, training, whatever material, intelligence and other assistance we can give them if they move into
Wazeristan -- including relief for displaced persons). If they finally take that step, we can do all that is possible to
demonstrate that our arrows are aligned with theirs..
-- On the civilian side, their desire for greater control over how Kerry-Lugar money can be used can be played to our
strategic advantage. If we give them a greater sense that they are directing the use of these funds -- without greatly
undercutting their effectiveness -- it strengthens our position to press them on AQ.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760082 Date: 06/30/2015
-- Finally, there is the defining relationship with India. Are there measures that the Indians could take that would reduce
Pakistani anxieties about the Indian front and thus better enable them to focus on threats to the East, including both AQ
and anti-Indian militant groups like LET? Are there confidence building measures such as information sharing on troop
movements that would both reduce uncertainty and support a Pakistani public narrative for a shift in emphasis from
India to the militancy? To the extent India seeks to have Pakistan move more vigorously against the militants, they could
see such steps as advancing their interests. This is tricky territory but may be worth pursuing.

I'm at a gathering In Italy on Beijing's unfinished agenda with many of your friends -- a group as diverse as Yunus and
Tina Brown. You have gotten so many plaudits for your honest engagement in Pakistan.
I'm sure it brings back many memories to be in Marrekesh. The women in Morocco have achieved a great deal,
especially with the family code reform -- and they have had the support of the King. The gender initiative idea that is
part of the FFF is still unformed. I think if you say positive things about its potential, it could make a difference for how it
goes forward and we can help.
You make us proud.

Hello Madame Secretary. I hope you have a productive trip to Pakistan. I wanted to let you know that Ambassador
Haqqani asked me to submit a proposal to help the Government of Pakistan strengthen its communications with the
Pakistani public.
You may recall that my firm did similar hands-on work in Lebanon. The idea is to enhance the Government's internal
capacity to raise public awareness of its accomplishments, build support for its policies, and demonstrate the benefits of
democratic governance.
With stronger communications, they'd obviously be in a better position to convey the benefits of the US-Pakistan
relationship. We've followed Pakistani media coverage of Kerry-Lugar -- with more strategic communications
management by the Government, that could have been a positive story.
(The anti-American forces have used the same messages to attack US aid packages for at least 10 years. It was easy to
see the attacks coming.)
Communications help won't solve the immediate political crisis, but it could be one useful element of a larger strategic
communications strategy.

Hillary,
I admire the way you handled yourself during your trip to Pakistan. It reminds me of the daunting job before you and it's
potential.
Successfully engaging the power of the DOS and the array of relevant external relationships on behalf of your goals will
remain a central challenge.
As we discussed, gathering a handful of loyal and trusted outside advisors could provide a valuable tool in this regard.
Given your late October or early November target for the first meeting, I have been working with Cheryl to come up with
a date. I guess given all that is going on possible dates seem to continually slip away.
I would understand if, in the context of everything on your plate this advisory group is just not practical. However, if you
do feel that such a gathering would be helpful and want to proceed, I believe you need to step in, select the initial date
or dates (with risk that it may need to change) and extend the invitations. A quick note to Mickey, Gordon, Maggie and
any others you want to include. Others mentioned so far include Sandy Berger, Strobe Talbott and Elaine Kamarck.
For at least the first gathering, you may want to consider two parts. A dinner, breakfast or other informal event plus a
more structured meeting would create the opportunity for informal discussion and time for reflection.
In the event you do want to move forward, I am happy to assist in any way that may be useful. Please know that I in no
way want to push this beyond where you may want to go.

Description:
The International Center for Research of Women (ICRW) has established a fellowship in memory of Brooke Shearer, a
former ICRW board member and dedicated advocate for improving the health and economic status of women in the
developing world. The Brooke Shearer fellowship in India is an opportunity for U.S. early career professionals with
graduate degrees to contribute to research and programs that advance gender equality and empower women in Asia.
Shearer was a stalwart supporter and contributor to ICRW's mission and work. ICRW honors her commitment to women
with a fellowship program based in our Asia Regional Office in New Delhi, India, a tribute to Shearer's fond memories of
her time spent in India during her youth and her tenure on ICRW's board.
The 2009 fellow will work in collaboration with the Asia director of the social and economic development group on
programs, research, advocacy, and business development related to the group's portfolio of work. The specific activities
of the fellow will be determined based on the substantive and technical skills, interests, and experience of the candidate
selected and the current opportunities in the group. Likely projects for engagement include:

The International Center for Research of Women (ICRW). New Delhi, India.
Description:
The International Center for Research of Women (ICRW) has established a fellowship in memory of Brooke Shearer, a
former ICRW board member and dedicated advocate for improving the health and economic status of women in the
developing world. The Brooke Shearer fellowship in India is an opportunity for U.S. early career professionals with
graduate degrees to contribute to research and programs that advance gender equality and empower women in Asia.
Shearer was a stalwart supporter and contributor to ICRW's mission and work. ICRW honors her commitment to women
with a fellowship program based in our Asia Regional Office in New Delhi, India, a tribute to Shearer's fond memories of
her time spent in India during her youth and her tenure on ICRW's board.
The 2009 fellow will work in collaboration with the Asia director of the social and economic development group on
programs, research, advocacy, and business development related to the group's portfolio of work. The specific activities
of the fellow will be determined based on the substantive and technical skills, interests, and experience of the candidate
selected and the current opportunities in the group. Likely projects for engagement include:
The PACE program-an ICRW collaboration with Gap Inc. on workplace and personal advancement of
female garment workers in India, Cambodia, Bangladesh.
The Counting Girls Project-a project examining son preference in India and China, the effectiveness of
specific policy efforts in addressing sex selection and discrimination against girl children, and the potential conflict
between the human rights of girls and reproductive rights for women.
Delayed Marriage-project examining the social norms that would need to be changed to eliminate early
marriage.
Primary Duties:
The fellow will engage in the following responsibilities and tasks:
Develop technical content of projects including conceptualization, data analysis, background research,
program and evaluation design, survey and instrument design;
Work with national and international partners on technical assistance, partner engagement and support,
and relationship management;
Work on project management tasks including administration, budgets, team coordination and work plans;
Write, synthesize and present findings in reports, briefs, papers and presentations;
Assist with business development activities including grant writing and proposals;
Prepare research and program findings for communication to various audiences (donors, policy-makers,
program personnel, researchers) at various forums and opportunities (meetings, events, cultivation, deliverables).

Madame Secretary:
Thank you for reaching out to Secretary Solis and convincing her to join the Verification Commission. She and Ricardo
Lagos will make for a very high profile and effective international component of the Commission.
We will meet with her this morning at 10 am to brief her for Tuesday's journey to Honduras. At this point, it appears we
have a military aircraft available. The plan is for the U.S. Delegation to depart D.C., stop in Miami to pick up Ricardo
Lagos, and arrive in Tegucigalpa together. We think this will send a powerful message to Hondurans and leave no doubt
about our commitment to seeing this process through to a successful conclusion.
You should be aware that Ambassador Hugo Llorens is under public assault. The Wall Street Journal dedicates its
America's column this morning to attacking him and calling for his removal. Last Friday, Representative Connie Mack did
the same. This chorus will grow as the extent of our accomplishment is understood. Llorens is a tough, stalwart guy. He
and his Mission have held firm during this crisis. A call from you would be a big boost.
Finally, we will hold an IPC today to identify further steps. We will keep you up to date on these steps and identify
further opportunities for your engagement.

I want to thank you for your leadership and support during this long crisis. Your willingness to engage at key moments
and take risks at the right time have propelled us much further than anyone expected. Your diplomacy prevented a
debilitating civil conflict in Honduras that would have destabilized Central America and undermined two decades of our
efforts. We now have a big opportunity in front of us, and for that we are grateful to you.

First — I want to say again what a great job you have done on Food Security — not only the video but helping us get the
site up and ready in less than 24 hours — many thanks. Love the metrics below — makes it all worth it.
Second — let's set a time to discuss this new idea.
Yeah!

Cheryl
Hope this finds you well. I wanted to update you on the success of the video and also share a new idea with you. Give
the statistical results below, I honestly believe this is the State Departments first ever successful instance of policy
advocacy via viral video and the impact we have raised is worth noting. I have heard comments from all over the
building and outside that this is a new level of creating content/video that is engaging, interesting, educating and that
can have long term value for State and partners to use. Bottom-line, we have done something new in raising
awareness/attention on a major foreign policy initiative through compelling, and viral video -- the Department of State
has raised the bar.
It is hard to read the traffic exactly to their sites and ours but here are some initial stats:
Top line: Using State.gov, America.gov, Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and more, we have use new media and connection
technology tools to reach over an estimated 100K audiences domestically and internationally through the video on Food
Security and ultimately have brought press and attention to a new focus. This video is engaging in that it raises
awareness and education on a critical foreign policy issue.
1. It is one of the top 20 videos viewed on our Youtube channel, with over 5K views and rising. Considering how much
video we generate through the daily press briefings and videos through S remarks daily, I think this carries tremendous
weight that in a short amount of time and little push to reach out to communities we have raised the bar for engaging
content through video.
2. Many organizations and users on Youtube have picked up the video and reposted on their channels, for examples
it is has been picked up heavily in China from one user who generated 3K views on his own already and I have been told
that it has been posted on major Ethiopian blogs through their video channels as well.
3. Over 12,000 (estimated) have visited our main video page through State.gov where the video was featured.
4. Almost 9K people have visited the Global Food Security page through State.gov to get more information.
5. ' Through pushing out on social networking presences at State, we have reached over 65,000 people who subscribe
and follow the Department of State and we pushed this video and the broader FS page to those communities through
Facebook, Twitter, and more.
Next Steps:
1. We are making DVD's to give to posts
2. Working on distributing to bloggers for continued use
3. Will feature and push video to a larger audience when op-ed runs through a second push

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760138 Date: 06/30/2015
4. Will work to feature prominently on World Food Day
5. Working to translate and subtitle video for usage in countries around the world.
New Idea:
Cheryl, wanted to talk to you about a new idea that I have presented before but thought about using for FS in a modified
form. I discussed with Caitlin and wanted to see if you thought this was a good idea.
This proposal is to ask that Secretary Clinton begin an online conversation on Food Security where she can engage with
people at home and abroad.
1. Through a video announcement she announces the opening of a global and engaging talk worldwide talk on global
hunger and invites people to submit questions on the topic. People can submit questions via video, text, email,
comment.
2. The community votes and comments on the best questions submitted by one another and votes on the best ones.
3. After two weeks, Secretary Clinton answers then the top five questions in her own response video. *** We could
even bring person with best question to DC to be a citizen journalist for a day and ask the top questions in person.
4. We then use this video as a way to talk about the most frequently asked questions on global hunger, HRC's
responses to them and we have engaged a global community on the topic.

I can attest to the fact that this has thus far been the shining star of the initiative (from a non-policy perspective) and I
think speaks to how hrc will do diplomacy and development differently.
In addition to what katie mentioned-- Institute for International Education (goodman) included it in their weekly email to
more than 8000 institutions, Pepsi showed it an internal meeting last week and will show it at a global conference this
week, and CGI has gotten feedback about the video and has gotten increased interest in commitments in this area. It has
also been pushed out to posts through internal sites.
We are also trying to see if we can get it in a rotation or on mtvU or their website and bet as part of the world food day
push.

France: 'Autistic Tories have castrated UK in Europe'
French Europe minister says David Cameron's pledge to reclaim EU powers is 'pathetic' and will leave Britain isolated

guardian.co.uk <http://www.guardian.co.uk>, Wednesday 4 November 2009 21.30 GMT
The Conservatives <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/conservatives> were accused by the French government
tonight of "castrating" Britain's position within the EU by adopting an "autistic" approach that would take Britain off the
radar.
Speaking to the Guardian, Pierre Lellouche, France's Europe minister, described as "pathetic" the Tories' EU plans
announced today, warning they would not succeed "for a minute".
Giving vent to frustration across the EU, which has so far only been expressed in private, Lellouche — who said he was
reflecting Nicolas Sarkozy's "sadness and regret" — accused William Hague, the shadow foreign secretary, of a "bizarre
autism" in their discussions.
He said: "They have one line and they just repeat one line. It is a very bizarre sense of autism."
Lellouche, one of the most Anglophile members of Sarkozy's government, made his remarkable intervention after David
Cameron <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davidcameron> outlined a fresh Tory approach to the EU in the wake of
the full ratification of the Lisbon treaty.
A future Conservative government would seek to strengthen British sovereignty and repatriate a series of powers over
social and employment legislation, the Tory leader said.
Cameron said he was not seeking an immediate "bust-up" with the EU, and would allow the repatriation of powers
negotiations to last as long as five years.
But that position was not enough for the Tory MEP Daniel Hannan, who quit his role as the party's legal affairs
spokesman in Europe, saying he intended to fight for referendums to enable Britain to become "self-governing".
France's centre-right government condemned Cameron's plans, saying that they would marginalise Britain within the
EU.
Abandoning all diplomatic niceties, Lellouche said: "It's pathetic. It's just very sad to see Britain, so important in Europe,
just cutting itself out from the rest and disappearing from the radar map .... This is a culture of opposition ... It is the
result of a long period of opposition. I know they will come back, but I hope the trip will be short." He said Cameron's
approach was in line with the Tories' decision to abandon the main centre-right EPP grouping in the European
parliament, of which Sarkozy's UMP party is a member.
"They are doing what they have done in the European parliament. They have essentially castrated your UK influence in
the European parliament," he said.
Lellouche said he has told Hague personally that his position was a "waste of time for all of us".
"I have told William Hague: go away for two to three years, in your political economic situation you're going to be all by
your self and you'll come back. Go ahead and do it. That is my message to them ... You want to be marginalised? Well,
you go for it. But it's a waste of time for all of us," the French minister said.
Lellouche made clear the Tories had no hope of securing support for their plans. "It's not going to happen for a minute.
Nobody is going to indulge in rewriting [treaties for] many, many years. Nobody is going to play with the institutions
again. It's going to be take it or leave it and they should be honest and say that," he said. "It is a time of tumultuous
waters all around us. Wars, terrorism, proliferation, Afghanistan, energy with Russia, massive immigration, economic
crisis. It is time when the destiny of Europe is being defined — whether or not we will exist as a third of the world's GDP
capable of fighting it out on climateion trade, on every ... issue on the surface of the Earth.
"We need to be united, otherwise we will be wiped out and marginalised. None of us can do it alone. Whether you're big
or small, the lesson is the same. And [Britain's] risk is one of marginalisation. Irrelevance." He explained: "Finally we have
institutional package, but it took 15 years of looking at our navel and getting everybody bored to death with sterile
debate"
In a sign of France's determination to resist the Tory plans to opt out of key EU legislation, Lellouche warned the French
would attempt to reduce Britain's EU budget rebate which will be up for negotiation during the next parliament.
He pointed out that France is a net EU contributor to the tune of €5bn (E4.5bn), unlike Britain which receives a rebate.
"If we get a government that is ferociously anti European that will vote down this kind of legislation then I think the
relationship is going to be very difficult. As we enter the next phase one of the issues we have to discuss midterm is of

course finances. France is a net contributor to the tune of €5bn a year, of which €1.5bn is the same as British rebate.
That should tell you quite a bit huh?" he said.
Cameron will be angered by the attack, and what it implies for Tory relations with the rest of Europe although in the
short term he will be more concerned to ensure his strategy of abandoning a referendum on the Lisbon treaty does not
provoke cries of betrayal on his backbenches.
Hague reacted to the French criticism by insisting that Lellouche's comments did not represent the true reception of the
Tories' plans in Europe.
"That is not how we are seen across Europe," he told BBC2's Newsnight, adding his party had established good relations
with Sarkozy's party.
"I don't think you will find that's representative of the reaction in Paris or other European capitals," he added.

Re: Agenda with Merkel
The Transatlantic Economic Council was Chancellor Angela Merkel's major initiative when Germany held the EU
presidency in 2007. She got President George W. Bush to agree to its formation. But the council now languishes. Has the
US appointed its representative? The council is more about coordinating regulatory matters than trade, by the way.
Raising Merkel's project and reinvigorating it would undoubtedly be well received. Below is an article from Europolitics
Daily from January 2009 on the council. State could work this up.

future By Brian Beary in Washington I Friday 16 January 2009
As Barack Obama was coasting to victory last November, the leader of the Socialist MEPs, Martin Schulz, urged him to
"make sure Europe is on the top of his in-tray". Two months on, there is considerable doubt as to whether Obama will
indeed take this advice or leave Europe lingering towards the bottom of the pile. Nowhere is this danger more striking

than with the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC), the body German Chancellor Angela Merkel persuaded President
George Bush to set up in April 2007 to remove regulatory barriers to transatlantic trade.
STILL NO TEC CHAIR
Obama has been widely praised for moving quickly, by comparison to previous new presidents, to nominate his new
administration. Yet his spokesman told Europolitics he has still not appointed the future co-chair of the TEC. In the
interim, Michelle O'Neill, Deputy Undersecretary at the Department of Commerce, has been tasked with ensuring
continuity. The EU Co-Chair is Commission Vice-President Gunter Verheugen. Given that dozens of nominations have
already been announced, this may be a sign that among his long list of priorities, the TEC, the most significant EU-US
initiative to emerge in recent years, will not feature highly. It should be noted that when Obama was chair of the Senate
Subcommittee on Europe, from 2007 to 2008, he did not organise a single hearing, something on which his then rival in
the presidential campaign, Senator Hillary Clinton, tried - and failed - to score political points.
The Democrats, who have grown more protectionist-minded on trade, now have a commanding majority in both the US
Senate and House of Representatives. Obama, himself a Democrat, is being careful to cultivate good relations with them
and not take for granted their support, which he desperately needs to push through his ambitious economic policy
agenda. It was Congress that in 2007 introduced the 100% rule, requiring all US-bound containers leaving European
ports to be scanned before being loaded onto the departing ship. This has been a thorn in the EU's side ever since and
now features on the TEC agenda. In the current climate, Congress is unlikely to be clamouring to scrap the rule and may
not even wish to extend the 2012 implementation deadline as the EU is asking. Anxious not to burn bridges, Obama
could well go along with Congress in order to avoid an unnecessary fight.
AMERICANS NOT SO HOT ON TRADE
Congress' protectionism does not magically appear in a vacuum. It is reflective of mounting fears among the US public
about the impact free trade has on US jobs. Their fears are not entirely groundless. American manufacturing jobs are
indeed going overseas - notably to India and China. And being unemployed in the US is a more perilous predicament
than in Europe because government unemployment benefits are less generous and more temporary. Moreover, most
Americans, unlike Europeans, have their health care paid for by their employer so if they lose their job they also lose
their health care. Hardly surprising, therefore, that only 59% of Americans think trade is good for their country,
compared to 78% of French and British, 80% of Czechs and 85% of Germans, a Pew Research Centre survey has shown.
This bearish sentiment has a knock-on effect on all trade dossiers. For example, it makes Congress less amenable to
scrapping the law requiring US airlines to be in 'actual control' of US citizens - something the EU is urging in the current
Open Sky II aviation liberalisation talks. It makes US lawmakers more likely to take action to prevent European
companies winning lucrative US defence contracts. This is happening already with the epic tussle between Boeing and
Airbus over the Pentagon's US$35 billion refuelling tanker contract (see separate article). EU officials are clinging to the
hope that Obama, as president, will adopt a more global outlook and drag the Democratic Congress along with him
rather than the other way around.
A VICTIM OF DULLNESS?
The TEC, despite having failed to deliver as much as many hoped for, remains an extremely useful tool. By emphasising
regulatory rather than tariff barriers, it shows an understanding of where the real problems lie in today's trading
environment. The EU and the US could use the TEC to create a global standard in hugely important sectors, such as toys
and food. "The alternative," as Dan Hamilton, director of the Centre for Transatlantic Relations at Johns Hopkins
University in Washington notes, "is that we end up with Chinese standards".
Yet the TEC has one weakness no one should underestimate: its dullness. Discussing highly technical regulatory
divergences, such as whether to wash chickens in chlorine or water, may have been Chancellor Merkel's cup of tea but
French President Nicolas Sarkozy showed little interest in it during the French EU Presidency. Without strong impetus
from someone on Obama's team who has the power to make things happen, the TEC - like an old soldier - might not
actually die but just fade away.
EU-US economy
While there is much talk about the rising power of China and India, the transatlantic economy still far outstrips the rest
of the world in size and wealth. The EU27 and the US accounted for nearly 57% of world gross domestic product in 2007,
while the transatlantic economy made up 47% of world exports and 52% of world imports. The net worth per household
in the US is US$565,000, in France US$518,000, in the U.K. US$599,000, compared to just US$18,000 in China,
US$31,000 in Russia and US$44,000 Brazil.

Holds, delays on Cabinet picks hurting American businesses
By Nelson W. Cunningham - 10/06/09 03:45 PM ET
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760158 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760158 Date: 07/31/2015
You may never have heard of the Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, or the Under Secretary of
Treasury for International Affairs. You may have vaguely assumed there was a Deputy United States Trade
Representative, and an Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs, and an ambassador to Brazil, but
never thought much of them or what they do.
But ask American CEOs and business leaders who they turn to in Washington for help getting a fair shake in foreign
markets or untying global trade knots, and you will learn that these are the very officials they rely on. Yet today, when
every export dollar and trade-supported job is essential to America's economic recovery, these key positions sit empty.
And, surprisingly, these five seats are empty because of stalls and behind-the-scenes maneuvers by Senate Republicans
— usually key allies of U.S. business.
In each case, the names went up months ago. The nominees have strong credentials and many have demonstrated
strong bipartisan support. The reasons for the holds and delays vary. But even if the blocking actions are unrelated,
collectively they deny American businesses their most effective overseas advocates.
•Miriam Sapiro, who was unanimously approved by the Finance Committee in July to be Deputy United States Trade
Representative with responsibility for trade agreements and enforcement with Europe and the Americas (including
NAFTA), has a one-man hold by Sen. Jim Bunning (R-Ky.) over a Canadian tobacco bill.
•Arturo Valenzuela, nominee for Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere, was overwhelmingly approved by
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in July, but Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) has a one-man hold on Valenzuela as a
protest against the administration's Honduras policy.
•Thomas Shannon, nominee for ambassador to Brazil, is also being blocked by Sen. DeMint over Honduras. Shannon is
hardly political, but is a career foreign service officer who was President Bush's top official for Latin America at the NSC
and then the State Department.
•Francisco Sanchez, nominated in April to be Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, responsible for
advancing U.S. export and trade opportunities around the world. Republican staff under Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) on
the Finance Committee have repeatedly delayed a hearing.
•Lael Brainard, nominated in March to be Under Secretary of Treasury for International Affairs, is also being held up by
the Republican staff on the Finance Committee. With an empty chair in this powerful position — it was previously held
by future Treasury Secretaries Timothy Geithner and Lawrence Summers — our ability to coordinate a response to the
financial crisis is hampered at a time when we can't afford it.
Who is hurt by these holds and staff delays? Certainly the president, who is facing the worst economic crisis in 50 years,
a stalled trade agenda, and economic and political turmoil in many parts of Latin America, including the hot-button crisis
in Honduras.
But U.S. businesses are also hurt. When American companies find themselves in commercial or trade disputes abroad, or
face unfair competition from foreign companies or discriminatory practices from regulators, they turn directly to the
roster above. With all these chairs empty, U.S. businesses with problems abroad find themselves facing a classic
Goldilocks problem — the Cabinet secretaries above are too big (and too busy), and the officials below are too small to
have an impact at the right levels.
Moreover, the international economic issues of greatest interest to U.S. businesses are precisely the ones that are being
hampered by these vacancies: balanced and coordinated growth out of the Great Recession, promotion of job-
generating U.S. exports, delayed trade agreements with Colombia and Panama, barriers into Brazil's huge market, trade
tensions with Canada (our largest trading partner) and security and border issues with Mexico (our second-largest),
among many others.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760158 Date: 07/31/2015
And while all U.S. business interests overseas are affected by these vacancies, it is our business and political interests in
the Americas that are being hit most directly, because of the responsibilities and expertise of the five nominees.
Predictably, this lamentable situation is renewing cries from our neighbors that even under a promising new president,
they continue to be neglected. And as importantly, our ability to help shape political and economic events in our
hemisphere to advance U.S. interests is suffering greatly. Who wins when we can't act? Our foreign competitors; not
just foreign companies, but Hugo Chavez and his anti-democratic allies.
All this is not to cast blame on the United States Senate, which has a constitutional duty to provide "advice and consent"
on presidential nominations (though it may cause one to question the tradition that permits a single senator to put an
indefinite hold on a nominee). Nor is it to cast blame solely on Republican members or staff. Democratic senators and
their staffs used these same parliamentary maneuvers under Republican presidents.
But it is to say that those who engage in those tactics now — at a time of global economic crisis and with growing
financial, trade and political frictions in our own hemisphere — should be reminded of the harm done to important U.S.
interests. In the days after 9/11, the Democratically-controlled Senate moved swiftly to confirm the U.N. ambassador
and other stalled security-related posts. Today's circumstances are not the same by any means, but as we confront the
worst economic crisis in over 50 years, these are surely no ordinary times.
The time has come for the Senate to carry out its constitutional duty and to end the delays on these five key commerce
and trade nominations. American business deserves an A Team by its side.

Clinton set to smooth Obama's visit to China
By Edward Luce in Washington and Geoff Dyer in Beijing
Published: November 4 2009 02:00 I Last updated: November 4 2009 02:00
Hillary Clinton is on course to raise the $61m in private money needed to build a US pavilion for a trade fair in Shanghai
next year, Clearing one of the main foreign policy obstacles ahead of Barack Obama's state visit to China next week.
Mrs Clinton, whose first visit as secretary of state was to China, inherited a situation where the US was the only country
other than Andorra that had failed to confirm its attendance at the Shanghai Expo - to the chagrin of the Chinese.
America's absence from the fair, running from May to October, was the first issue to be raised by the Chinese when Mrs
Clinton visited in February. "The Chinese were very upset," says Elizabeth Baghley, who heads Mrs Clinton's office for
global partnerships. "When she came back from China she said: 'Whatever it takes, this matters to China and to US
business and we are going to get this done'."

The task was more arduous than expected. Unlike all the other participants in what is expected to be the largest trade
fair in history, the US administration is barred by federal law from spending a single public dollar on global trade fairs.
Mrs Clinton, who has extensive experience at fundraising as a presidential and senatorial candidate, was also prevented
from asking for money herself.
The bureaucratic obstacles were made worse by the fact the Chinese had already tapped large US companies, such as
Cisco and Coca-Cola, to spend money on their own corporate pavilions, which will face their national counterparts
across the river around the fair in Shanghai. The situation was retrieved when three companies - Chevron, GE and
PepsiCo - were persuaded to put up $5m (€3.4m, £3m) each. So far $46m has been pledged.
Mrs Clinton's emphasis on getting a US pavilion contrasted strongly with the attitude of the Bush administration. Some
even referred disparagingly to the "Chi-comms" - an old-fashioned abbreviation for Chinese communists. "The state
department basically saw it as a lost cause," says one state department official. "Some people laughed when they heard
Hillary wanted to do this."
Shanghai has huge hopes for the Expo, which it sees as a chance to cement the city's global brand as an international
financial centre and modern metropolis. With an official budget of Rmb28.6bn ($4.2bn) and 70m expected visitors over
the six months, the Expo has been marketed as the sort of coming-out party for Shanghai that last year's Olympics was
for Beijing - and an event to rival the great 19th century world fairs in London, Paris and Chicago.
Given such heady expectations for what will be the world's largest fair, the absence of the US would have been
considered a huge slight and a loss of face for the Chinese. Mindful of how much it mattered to the Chinese, Mrs Clinton
saw it as an opportunity to build their trust. During strategic and economic talks with Chinese counterparts in
Washington last summer, Mrs Clinton vowed she would get it done even if she had to "build it myself, brick by brick".
Mrs Clinton was also backed by John Huntsman, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Utah, who
repeatedly told Washington how much symbolic value it would bring to China.
Mrs Clinton, who will be with the US president on his state visit next week, is expected to visit the site and may be in a
position to announce that all the money has been raised.

Hillary's Moment: Clinton Faces the World By Joe Klein Time Magazine Wednesday, Nov. 04, 2009
It was Halloween night in Jerusalem, and Benjamin Netanyahu came dressed as a peacemaker. "We're prepared to start
peace talks immediately," the notoriously reluctant Israeli Prime Minister proclaimed, with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton standing at his side, poker-faced. "I think we should ... get on it and get with it."
It was a ploy, of course. The Palestinians were tangled up in themselves, yet again. They had elections looming, and their
leader, Mahmoud Abbas, had to hang tough: he was demanding a total freeze to Israeli settlement-building on the West
Bank — which was precisely what the Obama Administration had previously said it favored. Netanyahu was offering a
partial freeze, not including new settlements in East Jerusalem, the desired capital of a future Palestinian state. This was
a nonstarter for the Palestinians, but it had the holographic glow of a step forward. It was an "unprecedented" offer,
Netanyahu trumpeted, with the joy of a chess master springing a trap.(See photos from 60 years of Israel.)
It was a tough moment for Clinton, playing second fiddle at the Bibi-does-Gandhi show. President Barack Obama had
softened his language on the settlements a few weeks earlier: instead of a total freeze, he had talked about Israeli
"restraint" in settlement-building. And now Clinton seemed to cement the Administration's retreat, agreeing that
Netanyahu's proposal was, indeed, "unprecedented," even though the U.S. still favored a total freeze. The most
important thing, she added, was for the parties to get to the table as quickly as possible. The onus was back on the
Palestinians — and the Palestinians quickly expressed outrage at the Obama Administration's retreat. Their Arab
neighbors soon joined in, causing Clinton to backtrack two days later, telling reporters the Israeli plan "falls far short" of
U.S. expectations, although she still insisted on calling it "unprecedented," which was neither diplomatic nor wise.
Suddenly the Obama Administration seemed wobbly on the Middle East; clearly, Clinton had been too bullish on
Netanyahu's proposal (which had been negotiated over months with Middle East envoy George Mitchell and was seen,
privately, by the Americans as real progress). But the Administration's mission was to get the parties into peace talks
without preconditions. The Israelis were now in favor of talks. The Palestinians were setting preconditions. And Clinton
had violated an essential rule of her job: boring is almost always better.(See photos from the life and career of former
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.)
Clinton's Three Qualities

For the past 40 years, the awkward Middle East press conference has helped define the job of Secretary of State. You go
to Jerusalem or Ramallah; you stand there "guardedly optimistic" in public; in private, you try to move a comma, but the
Israelis or Palestinians move a semicolon to block your comma. The result is almost always the same: gridlock. The
breakthroughs, when they come, emanate from others. Walter Cronkite asks Anwar Sadat if he'd be willing to go to
Jerusalem ... and Sadat, to everyone's surprise, says yes. The Israelis and Palestinians hold secret meetings in Oslo and
reach what appears to be a breakthrough — they're talking! — which then becomes another dead end.
The job of Secretary of State is more thankless than glamorous; in some ways, the Department of State, a noble antique,
is still trying to come to terms with the invention of the telephone. In an era when Twitter haiku-messaging rules,
diplomacy moves at the speed, and requires the nuanced complexity, of literature. Power has drifted from State to the
National Security Council and the Pentagon, especially in wartime. Only a few of Clinton's recent predecessors have
distinguished themselves. Henry Kissinger, a National Security Adviser who belatedly became Secretary of State, was
Richard Nixon's schizophrenic alter ego; George Shultz was a strong policy voice in the Reagan Administration; James
Baker had clout because he was George H.W. Bush's best friend and a world-class dealmaker. Most of the others have
been frustrated or forgettable. And yet this is Hillary Clinton we're talking about — the second most popular American in
the world, an eternally compelling and supremely talented character, the subject of constant speculation, a walking
headline. Her very presence in the job makes it crucial once more.
It is a cliché to say that by naming Clinton, Obama brought his most popular potential opponent into the tent. The
conventional wisdom, too cynical by half, is that he thereby succeeded in neutering her, a theory bolstered by Clinton's
reticence during her first nine months on the job, with special envoys like Mitchell and Richard Holbrooke doing the
heavy lifting of diplomacy. But by naming Clinton, Obama also gave her great power, which cuts both ways: if she
becomes dissatisfied with her role or the Administration's policies, she can become a torpedo aimed at the Oval Office.
Colin Powell had similar power and a real gripe — the Iraq war — but never used it. Clinton has no such gripe, but as the
Obama Administration settles in and policy differences begin to emerge among the key players, the Powell conundrum
looms: How will Clinton choose to use her power? How will Obama react if and when she does?
Traditionally, the Secretary of State is judged on his or her ability to formulate policy, negotiate deals and manage the
striped-pants bureaucracy. Clinton has no history as a global strategist, although her performance in the 2008 campaign
indicates that she is a bit more conservative than the President, more the foreign policy realist than the Wilsonian
idealist. It is also too early to judge her skill as a manager or negotiator — although her performance in Jerusalem
indicates that she needs a few lessons in Middle East Haggling 101.
There are, however, three qualities that could make her a memorable Secretary of State. She brings a vision of
departmental reform — the need to elevate foreign aid programs to the same status and rigorous scrutiny as diplomacy
— that could change striped pants into chinos in the developing world. She is also the first elected politician to hold the
office since Edmund Muskie briefly did during the Carter Administration, which has enabled her to better understand
and interact with the politicians who run places like Afghanistan and Pakistan. But most important, she is an
international celebrity with a much higher profile than any of her recent predecessors and the ability — second only to
the President's — to change negative attitudes about the U.S. abroad.
She has the potential to become the most powerful public diplomat the U.S. has fielded in quite some time, although
her performance so far, at home and abroad, has occasionally been perplexing. At home, she has often seemed
tentative and deferential. In a conversation with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates aired by CNN in early October,
Clinton's cautious formality took a backseat to Gates' brisk, humorous confidence on policy issues. Abroad, she seems
far more confident, at times to the point of recklessness, as in Jerusalem. (See photos of the last days of Hillary Clinton's
campaign.)
Independence and Candor
In the last week of October, Secretary Clinton moved squarely to the center of the world stage, attempting, at the
behest of her special envoys, to improve the rocky alliance with Pakistan and nudge the Middle East pugilists into talks.
In the course of the trip, there were the first stray wisps of a hint that Clinton wanted to begin asserting her

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760165 Date: 06/30/2015
independence, as the Administration, facing roadblocks across the world, struggled for a firmer foreign policy tone after
an opening nine months that might be called the Rodney King — "Can't we all just get along?" — phase.
During her three days in Pakistan, she ran a gauntlet of town-hall meetings and media interviews that may have been
unprecedented, to use the word of the week, for a U.S. Secretary of State. The trip, planned by Holbrooke and Pakistan
specialist Vali Nasr, offered an unusually subtle itinerary for a U.S. diplomatic mission. A visit to a Sufi mosque that had
been bombed by Sunni extremists, for example, sent a powerful message to Pakistan's moderate Islamic majority. "We
saw her praying there," an academic named Shala Aziz told me, "and, for the first time, I'm thinking, The Americans have
hearts."(See photos of the suicide bombings in Islamabad.)
The big news was that Clinton allowed herself to be hammered with hostile questions from students, talk-show hosts
and Pashtun elders — and that, on occasion, she pushed back, raising incredibly sensitive issues, like why no one in the
Pakistani government knew where Osama bin Laden was, even though he had been in the country since 2002. Press
accounts either emphasized the embarrassment of a Secretary of State's getting pummeled or fixed on Clinton's
undiplomatic bluntness. But they missed the point: her candor, her willingness to listen to and acknowledge criticism,
had begun to undermine the prevailing Pakistani image of the U.S. as arrogant and bossy, more interested in having the
Pakistani military fight its war against al-Qaeda and the Taliban than in having a true strategic partnership. The contrast
was especially sharp after George W. Bush's eight years of unqualified support for the military dictatorship of Pervez
Musharraf. "In the past, when the Americans came, they would talk to the generals and go home," said Farahnaz
Ispahani, a government spokeswoman and Member of Parliament. "Clinton's willingness to meet with everyone, hostile
or not, has made a big impression — and because she's Hillary Clinton, with a real history of affinity for this country, it
means so much more."
Transformative Experience
There are no toasts at state dinners in Pakistan, because there is no alcohol. There are opening statements, though, and
Clinton's — delivered impromptu on the first night of her trip after tossing aside her notes — was surprisingly emotional.
Earlier in the day, President Asif Ali Zardari, the widower of Benazir Bhutto, had presented the Secretary with an album
of photos from her first visit to Pakistan, in 1995, and a framed photo of Bhutto and her two sons with Clinton and
daughter Chelsea. "It did bring tears to my eyes," Clinton said at the state dinner in her honor at the presidential palace,
"because I so admired your wife. She gave her life ..." She faltered then, choking up, but quickly pulled herself together,
talking about the "reasons why we do what we do — to provide opportunities for all."
Clinton's first trip to Pakistan as First Lady in 1995 had been a transformative experience for her — the beginning, I
believe, of the process that made her a plausible candidate for Secretary of State. I traveled with her on that trip; when
we set off, she seemed depressed and even more private than usual. The Democrats had cratered in the 1994
congressional elections, and she had been trounced in her efforts to enact a universal health care plan. It was a very
personal defeat; as Clinton traveled the country trying to sell the plan, crowds shouted her down and cursed her.
Privately she admitted she was shocked by the hatred. The trip to South Asia seemed a bit of a vacation — it was
Chelsea's spring break — but also a retreat to a more demure, First Lady–like role after two years as health care policy
czar, although it proceeded in a decidedly wonky, Hillarian fashion. Jackie Kennedy had gone to India and famously
ridden an elephant; Hillary Clinton traveled to five countries and packed her schedule with visits to NG0s.
"That was the greatest trip, just unbelievable," Clinton says now. We were sitting in her hotel suite the day after her
Jerusalem gaffe, the Secretary in an electric-blue shift rather than her usual formal jacket and pants. She was wearing
glasses and appeared rather freckly without her makeup. "I guess that trip has animated and informed everything I've
done since," she said. She emerged from the trip reinvigorated, with a new mission. By the end of 1995, at the U.N.
Conference on Women in Beijing, the First Lady had propounded a new Clinton Doctrine: "Women's rights are human
rights."(See photos of Beijing's changing skyline.)
Clinton is not an easy interview. She is preternaturally cautious, a consequence of her Methodist propriety and 20 years
of insane public scrutiny. She does not like to talk about herself, but she did tell me one interesting story about Bhutto.
When her husband was governor of Arkansas, she and Bill and Chelsea visited London and stood on the sidewalk outside
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760165 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760165 Date: 06/30/2015
Bhutto's hotel, waiting for the then Pakistani Prime Minister to arrive. "She was wearing a yellow embroidered shalwar
kameez with a chiffon scarf. I was just a fan, standing on the sidewalk with everyone else. It was the only time I ever did
anything like that," Clinton says.
When Clinton and Bhutto met formally, on the first day of the 1995 trip, they hit it off immediately, in part because
Bhutto was also obsessed with the impact the Islamist tide was having on women and children. I remember asking
Bhutto that day what the biggest change in her country had been over the past 25 years, and she said, "I used to be able
to walk down the street wearing jeans, without a headscarf. Now I can't." When I asked her why, she said — bluntly —
"The Saudis," who had been aggressively funding religious schools. Of course, Bhutto's acquiescence to, and
participation in, the general corruption of the Pakistani government was part of the reason public schools were so
inadequate and madrasahs became popular. (See photos from the aftermath of Benazir Bhutto's assassination in 2007.)
Ironically, the rise of Sunni extremist groups like al-Qaeda has brought Clinton's interests — microfinance, education and
health care — to the center of national-security policy for the first time. The impetus came not from the State
Department but from the military, where counterinsurgency doctrine demanded that social services in war zones —
schools, justice, economic development — reinforce the military's efforts to secure the population. As a result, there
was immediate chemistry between Clinton and General David Petraeus, author of the Army's counterinsurgency
manual, who became one of her prime military mentors when she served on the Senate Armed Services Committee. At
one point, well before Obama made his presidential intentions known, I asked Petraeus if there was any potential
Democratic candidate who understood how his mind worked, and he said, "You mean, aside from Hillary?"
It was Clinton who brought together Petraeus and Holbrooke ("my two alpha males," she calls them) for the first time —
at her home in Washington on the Friday before the Obama Inauguration. The affection and respect she gained for the
military while serving in the Senate has helped make the relationship between State and the Pentagon less fraught than
usual — although Defense Secretary Gates' insistence on the need for bigger State Department budgets hasn't hurt. In
fact, relations with the Pentagon have gone smoother, at times, than Clinton's relationship with the White House staff.
Clinton was particularly irritated by the ridiculously strict vetting process that thwarted her favored candidate for USAID
director, Paul Farmer, from getting the job. "It was all sorts of niggling things," says a Clinton adviser, "like, Farmer had
at one point brought more than $10,000 in cash into Haiti. The money was for a needle-exchange program, but the
amount was illegal."
Another of Clinton's military mentors, retired General Jack Keane, once told me, "I'm a Republican. I disagree with her
about practically everything, but she'd make a hell of a Commander in Chief." There is a palpable toughness to the
woman, a hard edge that contrasts with the President's instinctive impulse toward conciliation. One of the sharpest
exchanges of the presidential campaign came when Obama accused Clinton of echoing the "bluster" of George W. Bush
after she said the U.S. would be able to "obliterate" Iran if it used nuclear weapons against Israel. Clinton's edgier tone
has been evident from the start of the Administration: she took a sharper position than the President on an Israeli
settlement freeze by claiming, in May, that Obama wanted "to see a stop to settlements. Not some settlements, not
outposts, not natural-growth exceptions." And then, in Jerusalem, her use of the word unprecedented seemed a
rhetorical leap beyond the No Drama ground rules.(Read "Clinton's Collateral Damage.")
The White House was not entirely thrilled with either statement. But then the White House staff is several steps
removed from a negotiating process. The Palestinians are weak and divided. The Israelis have been difficult, as always:
whenever Mitchell raises East Jerusalem in talks with the Israeli Foreign Minister, the Israeli stands up and walks out of
the room. Despite Netanyahu's momentary, tactical enthusiasm for peace talks, his Likud Party has always favored the
de facto incorporation of Palestinian lands into the state of Israel.
Hillary's Choice
The tensions between the White House and State raise a fascinating question going forward. Obama and Clinton are in
substantive agreement on the President's diplomacy-first philosophy and on most policy issues — although neither is
willing to disclose the content of their private conversations — but style often predicts substance in foreign policy;
neither Obama's gauziness nor Clinton's inconsistent bluntness overseas seems particularly solid. There is a growing
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760165 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760165 Date: 06/30/2015
perception that the Administration's policies have been thwarted across the board: Afghanistan is a mess, Iran seems
ready to scuttle the nuclear negotiations, there's no progress in the Middle East, the Syrians and North Koreans remain
recalcitrant, the Russians have been offered a freebie on missile defense, and the Chinese have been given a pass on
human rights with no apparent quid pro quos.
The White House argues that some progress has been made: Iran is on the defensive, and North Korea has said it will
return to the six-party talks. Clinton argues, correctly, about the need for "strategic patience." But the only thing Obama
really has to show for his efforts so far is a Nobel Prize for Potential and — no small thing — the wisdom to have
refrained from doing anything so wildly stupid as invading Iraq. The President has been willing to use military force —
the Predator drones that have decimated al-Qaeda's leadership testify to his lack of squeamishness — but this
Administration is supposed to be about the efficacy of using subtler expressions of U.S. power. That doesn't happen
overnight, but for Obama's policies to be considered a success, it has to happen sooner or later, in a way that can be
explained to the public.
There is also a growing sense that the President's inexperience is beginning to show — not in his overall policy, which
represents the views of a broad, moderate national-security consensus ranging from Brent Scowcroft to John Kerry, but
in his execution of the details. The Afghan strategy review has been too public and taken too long; the Middle East peace
hunt has become a wild goose chase. A letter to Iran's Supreme Leader is a productive gesture only if it gets a response;
if it doesn't, it seems weak and supplicatory. A call for the Israelis to freeze settlements is effective only if it is
accompanied by the credible threat of a reduction in aid. "You can't be seen pushing countries around — demanding
[that] Israel freeze settlements, demanding that Hamid Karzai reform his government — and not get results," says Leslie
H. Gelb, author of Power Rules. "The leaders of these countries are tough, successful politicians, and they'll begin to take
you less seriously." (See photos from the 1979 revolution in Iran.)
Clinton is unwilling to acknowledge these problems, and her staff is loath to admit her occasional mistakes. Her praise
for the President is fulsome, and aides say the relationship with Obama really — really — is strong. But there are also
burblings and emanations from Clinton's staff and friends, Foggy Bottom body language, that suggest there is a need for
the Administration to produce a second act after the Rodney King phase. And the White House is perplexed by the
uncharacteristic lack of discipline indicated by Clinton's occasional overseas gaffes.
These tensions are well within the boundaries of normal, creative policymaking. There is absolutely no indication that
the Secretary is frustrated to the point of jumping ship — or returning to politics as a candidate for governor of New
York, as has been rumored. Quite the contrary, she seems intent on making history as Secretary of State. To do that,
though, she will have to have the same authority at home as she has abroad. She will have to become the President's
primary foreign policy voice. Over the first nine months of the Obama Administration, seven different Obama officials
have spoken on the Sunday talk shows about foreign policy. Clinton has been on each of the Sunday shows once. "Either
you have one person sending the foreign policy message, with the clear approval of the President," says a former
Republican Secretary of State, "or there is no message."(See photos from eight months of Obama's diplomacy.)
Aides to Obama say they would like to see her on the Sunday shows more often. (Indeed, Clinton's staff acknowledged
that she was asked to appear two additional times but was traveling and unable to do so.) Ultimately, though, television
is a metaphor for the larger questions that need to be resolved: How much can these former rivals — both extremely
guarded and private people — really trust each other; and, if not Clinton, who will emerge as the President's alter ego
on foreign policy? At this point, the strongest member of Obama's national-security team is Gates — but he's a
Republican and an unlikely spokesman or presidential confidant on anything beyond Pentagon issues. General Jim Jones
has settled in as National Security Adviser, but he's not a political animal — and every President needs a close foreign
policy adviser who understands the intersection of long-term strategy, politics and diplomatic chess.
Clinton's value to the Administration was clear in Pakistan. She wowed a public so skeptical that it had been questioning
the $7.5 billion in purely economic and humanitarian aid the Administration had promised. "How much damage control
have you been able to do on this trip?" asked Meher Bokhari, a television-news-show host, at the end of Clinton's
meeting with Pakistani women. The Secretary seemed nonplussed by the bluntness of the question. "I don't know," she
said. "I hope some."

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760165 Date: 06/30/2015
Afterward, I asked Bokhari to answer her own question. "Well, this trip was long overdue," she said. "The Pakistani
people really needed to talk to an American about our concerns — the strings attached to aid programs, the drone
attacks, their history of support for the military dictatorship. And it needs to be followed up. But if you ask me about the
damage control" — she paused, thinking it through — "I'd have to say a lot. She accomplished a lot."
In the end, though, Clinton's success will be determined by whether she can expand her role beyond public diplomat.
She will have to become a more sure-handed negotiator and, most important, a trusted adviser to a President who
knows where he wants to go in the world but hasn't quite figured out how to get there.

I have to say that this argument that the Taliban are ok to ignore is dangerous morally and politically.
The argument at the time was that harboring terrorism was the same as launching terrorism and that those who
harbored would be held responsible. This also had long term deterrence value against regimes that would outsource the
dirty work.
To now even consider giving the Taliban a pass after harboring terrorists who committed direct attacks on new York and
Washington defies the imagination. This wasn't some embassy bombing but a strike right at our country. The white
house or congress barely escaped destruction. Saddam Hussein wasn't connected to al Qaeda but the Taliban surely
were without question.
And Teheran and north Korea are watching carefully, gauging how much resolve the us has in stopping their plans. If the
us lets the Taliban off the hook then they certainly can conclude it will do nothing beyond sanctions with them. And
essentially letting karzai twist in the wind also suggests the us does not live up to it's commitments, giving pause to
those who would help the us.
Politically, this is also quite dangerous. Obama maintained througout the campaign and the start of his presidency that
this is the one to fight and backing down here makes him and the administration vulnerable to losing moderate support
and seeming weak and indecisive.
A single terrorist incident would be blamed on the admin. failing to do the job right.
I could go on and on with other negative ramifications but of all the options it appears to me any strategy that says
fighting the taliban are not in the strategic interests of the us should be doa.

Patrick Cockburn: To say this war must be won in a year is nonsense

Eight years ago I was standing on a hill 50 miles north of Kabul watching the flashes in the night sky as the US air strikes
started again st the Taliban front line. There were a few ineffective puffs of fire from Taliban anti-aircraft guns which
could do nothing against the bombs and missiles raining down on them.
It was a strange war to cover, not least because so little real fighting took place. The reputation of the Afghan fighting
man is partly based on agilely joining the winning side at the right moment. In the meantime they don't fight too hard
for anybody and try to avoid getting killed.
The US and British press mostly reported the war of 2001 as a real military conflict and rather missed the point that the
Taliban had just gone home. I remember visiting the former headquarters of a Taliban armoured brigade in the city of
Ghazni south west of Kabul. The tanks and armoured vehicles had all been smashed to pieces by American bombs, but
when I asked local people how many men the Taliban had lost, I was told "none at all. They could see what was going to
happen so they just ran away."
Just as the US military victory of 2001 was overstated, so eight years later is the sense of military crisis which is being
busily stoked by Gen Stanley A McChrystal, the top US and NATO commander in Afghanistan. In Washington military
officials are quoted as saying that the war will be won or lost in the next twelve months.

This is nonsense. The Taliban have been able to advance so rapidly in the last three years because they have Pakistani
backing and because of the spectacular political and military weakness of President Hamid Karzai's government. But the
Taliban draw all their strength from the Pashtun community, which makes up 42 per cent of the Afghan population.
They will have great difficulty advancing into areas occupied by the other 58 per cent of the population where there is a
Tajik, Hazara or Uzbek majority.
Squads of six or eight Taliban on motorcycles might be harassing the roads around Kabul, but there is no need to treat
them as if they were North Vietnamese divisions at the gates of Saigon in 1975.
The strength of the Taliban is that not that they can take and hold territory, but that they can inflict quite small military
losses on the US which are politically unacceptable back home. They can do this through roadside bombs, something the
US army speaks as if it were a new device, though it was being used against the British army in Ireland in 1921. If the
Americans and British try to hold territory supposedly cleared of Taliban with penny packets of troops then these are
vulnerable to being suddenly targeted by the other side.
It is to prevent this happening that Gen McChrystal has asked for an extra 40,000 soldiers. But Afghans tell me that more
foreign troops will simply mean more violence and dead Afghans as more of the country becomes a battlefield. It is
absurd to imagine that the world's most heavily equipped military force is not going to use its weapons when it comes
under attack. Polls also show that Taliban support is at its height in just those areas where Afghan civilians have been
killed by American shells and bombs.
So what should Obama do? First of all he has time. He is not going to win or lose the war in the next year. Like it or not
he is stuck with Mr Karzai and he should get used to the idea. It is reasonable to suggest helping to produce a larger
Afghan army and police force but this cannot be done overnight. Most military recruits are there for the money and are
too malnourished even to wear American flack jackets. Speeding up security training f or Afghan police meant over the
summer that terrified men, often on heroin, were being sent to man dangerous and isolated police posts with just three
weeks training. Many of them did not come back.
One way Obama could strengthen the Afghan army and police is to make sure their men are paid properly. In Kabul
many facilities are being guarded by policemen earning $70 a month, which is not enough to live on unless
supplemented with bribes. This contrasts with $250,000 a year paid to foreign consultants who lurk inside heavily
defended compounds. Paying the Iraqi army properly really did make a difference in Baghdad and might do the same in
Afghanistan where 40 per cent of men are unemployed. A difference is that Iraqi oil revenues last year were $62 billion
while the Afghan government is dependent on foreign aid.
The US and its allies will have to pay. It is carefully thought out measures like this that Obama should be considering and
not the panicky dispatch of US Special Forces or tens of thousand of more troops.

Re: Berlin speeches
Below are my notes for speeches in Berlin. The themes I stress are these: the importance of Berlin and the Brandenburg
Gate as symbols of freedom; the weight of history (always felt by Germans); the contribution of the US and the salience
of the Western alliance; the meaning of 1989 to today and especially the continuity of the Western alliance; and segue
from past to future.
What I have not done here but might be added are references to Angela Merkel (a courageous woman from the east
who embodies the highest values of the West); and specific policies. Those can be fitted in.
So, some ideas and language:
Twenty years ago the wall fell. Here, in Berlin, the moment when tens of thousands of citizens tore it down with
hammers and picks and bare hands is called "Die Wende," a phrase that means more than simply a change but a turning
point in history. It was not only a turning point for Germany and Europe but also for the United States because the
wall—the reason for its construction and the reason for its destruction—is central to our common history—and to our
common future.

Richard von Weizsaecker said, "As long as the Brandenburg Gate is closed, the German question will remain open."
Today I can say with finality, the German question is closed, because the Brandenburg Gate is wide open! The gate is
open, Europe is open, and our future together is open.
In the forty years from the Berlin airlift to the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Atlantic partnership proved itself the most
successful alliance for freedom in history. That alliance was, is and shall be the crowning achievement of American
foreign policy. And the German – American relationship has always served as its foundation. Our alliance represents the
reconciliation of former enemies, an inspiration to other peoples and continents devastated by war and hatred, and it
must never be taken for granted.
In the twenty years since the fall of the wall we have created architecture for an enduring peace. Instead of a wall we
have built a gateway to the future. President Kennedy said in 1963 that in the future free men everywhere will say, "Ich
bin emn Berliner." Today Berlin has gained a new and even more powerful meaning. Forever into the future, the opening
of this Gate will be the symbol of the return of the dream of freedom, not only to Berlin and Germany, but to the entire
world.
The Gate, we must remember, was not built as a symbol of freedom. And each of the tyrannies that used the Gate as a
symbol believed it represented their eternal power. The Gate was first erected as a symbol against the French
Revolution; then it became a symbol of the imperial ambitions of Napoleon who marched his army through. It was a
symbol of Prussian militarism and monarchy. It was seized by the Nazi Party as the symbol of its 1000 year rule. And
then it became a symbol of the Communist totalitarianism that built a wall to separate the people of Berlin as though
freedom could be contained in only one part of the city. Here, in Berlin, the Cold War was coldest.
We celebrate the fact that the wall that marred this proud city was taken down by the world's most enthusiastic
wrecking crew. The United States always believed in the freedom of Berlin because we believed in the future of
freedom. The courageous citizens of East Germany, Poland and other nations of the Communist bloc demonstrated their
dedication to free and peaceful solution of conflicts through their stand against dictatorship. America stood resolutely as
an ally at every moment of this struggle and moved swiftly to help the peoples of Europe reunite after 1989.
We celebrate the steadiness of purpose, the restraint and respect for ultimate goals that allowed the Cold War to end in
peace. For how the victory was won was essential to the triumph. 1989 was special. It was that rarest of historical
events: a revolution that did not descend into violence. As a result the Gate survives not as a cautionary monument to
history's darkest moments but to its brightest. Today we celebrate the revolution of 1989, the turning point that
transformed the Brandenburg Gate into the symbol of the hope of democracy and the promise of freedom.
Berliner Luft, the air of Berlin, has always been unique. I can feel and smell the spirit of freedom in your streets. The
great American poet Carl Sandburg called Berlin the Chicago of Europe. Chicago is where I was born and raised. I can
sense the same energy, openness and dedication to hard work in both great cities. Another Chicagoan, President Barack
Obama, was drawn to Berlin last July, a city that he said made him feel like a citizen of the world and a citizen of the
future.
I was very proud to visit our new Embassy at the Brandenburg Gate, located exactly where the Wall used to run. Our
presence here will forever underscore our determination that the spark of freedom from this city in 1989 will help light
the torches of freedom throughout the world.
The revolution of 1989 did not mark the end of history. Having made history together, we are summoned to secure
freedom for future generations. As vital at the beginning of the 21st century as it was in the last half of the 20th, the
Western alliance is called to new tasks. The dreams of 1989 reached far—and have farther to reach. Old hatreds and
conflicts—in the Balkins, the Caucauses, in the Middle East, East Asia, and Africa—still simmer. We have much to
demonstrate what we have learned from the last century. Without freedom, without the rule of law, without the
opportunity for people to support themselves and their families – without basic human rights-- anger, aggression and
violence will prevail.

Today we are faced with difficult and often dangerous conflicts arising not from conflicts between nations but within
them, conflicts exploited by zealots who make the false claim that violence will purify the world and open the gates of
heaven. Once zealots tried to use this Gate to symbolize that message. But through the courage and determination of
the people of Berlin and their stalwart allies, this Gate now stands for a true revolution of the spirit. The long twilight
struggle to tear down this wall to make Europe whole and free inspires us, in this new century, to help other peoples
gain the same measure of security, respect and progress.
We need Berlin more than ever today. We need your courage, your fortitude, your commitment to the rights of men—
and women—we need your example. We are hardly at the end of the history of the West. Standing here, where a wall
once stood but is no more, in the light from the Gate, we have learned from history's deepest lessons. Our alliance,
linked by shared struggle, dedicated to the ideals of freedom and democracy, strong from the world we have built, now
faces a new world of challenges. And we are ready to meet and conquer them. We know it has been done before. We
are free men—and women—and proud to say, We are all Berliners.

Dear Cheryl:
To update you on H1N1 and make a recommendation as we move forward.
I have asked to take the lead in the H1N1 negotiations, and she has been participating in the meetings with
WH, HHS, DOD and others. At this time, she is leading the discussions with other donors — UK, Australia, Swiss and
others — so they can work in a coordinated fashion under our leadership. Her expertise and knowledge in this area has
really helped in interacting with HHS and addressing the technical issues. She has also participated in meetings with Jack
Lew. I expect that this effort will require a considerable amount of her time for the next few weeks.

our "complementary engagement" program, which I briefly mentioned to you.
I understand our offices are working on the schedules, but nothing is firm yet.
Your personal involvement with this group - perhaps a small lunch - would be a very important message seen at the

I'd be personally grateful not only on behalf of our group, but also on behalf of a cause that I believe will be a part of

She advises that we need to give advance notice -
There are 4 seat in the Eisenhower that are complimentary and then 4 that would need to be purchased for nominal fee
(seems like a really silly policy) The same for Opera and in the Symphony there are 12 all complimentary. I think if we
begin to use the box on a regular basis we can work with them on the cost issues.
This could be a lovely way to serve many special guests.
Let me know if you want to begin a process of reviewing the KC calendar and start a list of recommendations to invite.

Washington, D.C. SECRETARY CLINTON GETS IT DONE; EMERGENCY RELIEF SUPPLIES TO BE AIRLIFTED FROM
GREATER LOS ANGELES AREA TO SAMOA IN RESPONSE TO DEVASTATING TSUNAMI
Chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific and the Global Environment, Congressman Eni F.H. Faleomavaega,
and Congresswoman Laura Richardson (D-CA), announced today that the U.S. Department of State called them this
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760203 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760203 Date: 06/30/2015
morning to inform them that Secretary Clinton has authorized the use of funds from the Office of Foreign Disaster
Assistance (OFDA) to get emergency relief supplies airlifted from the greater Los Angeles area to Samoa in response to
the devastating tsunami that struck Apia on September 29.
In his capacity as Chairman of the Asia Pacific Subcommittee which has broad jurisdiction for U.S. foreign policy affecting
the region, including Samoa, Chairman Faleomavaega personally spoke to Secretary Clinton on Oct 1 and, in letters
dated Oct 4 and Oct 5, followed up with her regarding the specific need to airlift emergency supplies to Apia, which
were gathered by the Samoan communities and congregations in the greater Los Angeles area.
The Samoan communities in the greater Los Angeles directly contacted Faleomavaega for assistance because many of
their families and relatives live in his district of American Samoa or Samoa. Congresswoman Laura Richardson has
worked closely with Faleomavaega throughout this process given that she represents part of the greater Los Angeles
area, and the Samoan communities living in that area are her constituents.
"I want to personally thank Secretary Clinton for her untiring efforts in getting these relief supplies airlifted," Chairman
Faleomavaega said. "Since the tsunami struck, Secretary Clinton has spared no effort in coming to our aid, and even
called upon the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) to quickly move these supplies from the West Coast to Samoa. Last
evening, Congresswoman Richardson and I learned that DOD had agreed to move the supplies but that due to legalities
of moving privately-donated goods, the process would take too long."
"In a previous conference call yesterday, anticipating that DOD might be unable to quickly move these supplies, we
requested the State Department to fund a commercial flight through the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance should we
encounter any problems with DOD," Faleomavaega and Rep. Richardson said. "Last night, upon learning that the DOD
process would take too long and in consideration of our request for a more immediate airlift, Secretary Clinton assessed
the options while en route to Europe, and this morning the State Department informed us that Secretary Clinton has
agreed to fund the flight with OFDA funds."
"The agreement is that this will be a one-time airlift, and our Samoan communities should make future donations in
cash, rather than in commodities. We will not be able to airlift frozen goods, and our offices will work closely with the
communities to gather the supplies to a central location for the airlift. Also, the airlift provided by the U.S. Department
of State can only be authorized to land in Samoa. While we were also hopeful to get supplies in to American Samoa, all
matters relating to American Samoa are decided between the Governor and FEMA, according to federal law."
"I know from my meeting earlier this week with Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi that he is thankful to the
Samoan congregations and communities in the greater Los Angeles area who responded from the heart by collecting
critical supplies that will now be airlifted to those in need," Faleomavaega said. "For this reason, I want to thank the
Prime Minister for agreeing to accept this gift, and I also want to thank Reverend Liki Tiatia, Reverend John Mailo,
Reverend Misipauena Tagaloa, and High Chief Loa Pele Faletogo for all the good work they have done. Reverend Tiatia
and Reverend Mailo will be taking a flight to Samoa to make the presentation to the Government of Samoa on behalf of
our Samoan community on the West Coast and also on behalf of Congresswoman Richardson and myself."
"I especially want to thank Congresswoman Richardson for working around the clock in support of our Samoan
communities living in her district, and in Samoa and American Samoa," Faleomavaega continued. "Congresswoman
Richardson has stood by us every step of the way and has left no stone unturned in getting this done. She has been
staunch and solid in her dedication to us, and has earned her rightful place in our hearts. It is my honor to welcome
Congresswoman Richardson into our Pacific Island family."
"With so many people in need of basic supplies in Samoa, it has been a privilege to work with Chairman Faleomavaega
to assist the people of my district in making sure the items they have collected will soon be in the hands of their families
and friends," Congresswoman Richardson said. "This feat is only possible because of the dedication of Chairman
Faleomavaega and Secretary Clinton. Over 60 local organizations in the 37th district of California, including church

groups, non-profit organizations and caring others collected over 100,000 pounds of essential items to send to victims of
the tragedy that recently occurred. The lives of thousands of Samoans will be immediately and directly improved by the
actions taken by Secretary Clinton, Chairman Faleomavaega and all of us who answered the call to help. I am proud to
be a part of this exceptional team."
"It is clear that change has come and that Secretary Clinton is restoring America's stature once again, especially in a part
of the world that the U.S. has too long neglected. We thank Secretary Clinton for her leadership and commitment, and
for standing with the people of Samoa when they need her most, and we continue to extend our deepest condolences
to the families and friends of those who are suffering so much," Faleomavaega and Rep. Richardson concluded.

Dear Hillary,
Spoke to the person you recommended on Friday. Sounds like he is comfortable and even surprised that Pakistanis are
doing more. And maybe he will find some more ways to help, like the helicopter leasing. When I mentioned that
someone deep in the ISI must be happy that Al Qaeda's alive, so we don't abandon Pakistan again, he chuckled.
I talked about the "vetting" for intelligence. I also talked "defeat strategy," and the need for something more than just
deploying more forces and hoping the training for the Afghans will work.
I continue to be struck by the parallels to Vietnam, and especially Johnson's inability to resist escalation, and his
advisor's continued "incrementalism."
But I'm encouraged by the pace of the review. Seems that there's sufficient time to consider this from all angles.
I can imagine there are those arguing that we just need to fill the gap while we enlarge the Afghan army. That we help
the Pakistanis but not press them to the point of being unpleasant. And that too much focus on Osama and al-Zawahiri
raises the risk of public failure if we don't get them. There is much logic to this, but it has a strong tint of incrementalism.
Hopefully, we can be more decisive: lean harder on the Pakistanis, provide more troops to McChrystal than his
"moderate risk" and raise the heat on al Qaeda - then do all we can to push economic development in Afghanistan,
restrain Indian meddling, and prepare to do more against Al Qaeda in Pakistan, directly if necessary. Ultimately, it
seems that our best exit strategy would be to take down the top leadership of Al Qaeda in Pakistan, and then gradually
draw down in Afghanistan.
Wish I could do more to help
All the best,
Wes

Gordon Brown has hospital eye tests
Fears are growing over the health of Gordon Brown after Downing Street revealed the Prime Minister has visited

Gordon Brown lost the sight in one eye in a childhood rugby injury Photo: PA Mr Brown visited Moorfields in London,
one of the world's best-known eye hospitals, after surgeons found two small tears in his retina.
The disclosure comes just two weeks after Labour Party chiefs were angry with the BBC because Andrew Marr, the
presenter, questioned the Prime Minister about his health, including his eyesight, during an interview.

Mr20Marr asked Mr Brown if he has been taking prescription drugs after rumours spread on the internet that he was
dependant on painkillers or antidepressants.
Mr Brown talked on the programme about losing the sight in one eye following a boyhood rugby. "I then had exactly the
same thing happen in my second eye. I had the same retinal detachment. I had the same fear that therefore I might lose
my sight in that eye," he admitted.
In a carefully-worded statement, No 10 said today: "This summer Mr Brown had his annual eye check-up which was fine.
Later he had his retina checked.
"After examinations, surgeons found that the retina had two minor tears. However, as there has been no further
deterioration, and no change in his eye sight, they decided against further operations. Yesterday [Friday] Mr Brown
visited Moorfields Hospital as part of regular c hecks on his eyes and this check was also fine.
"Mr Brown wants to thank the doctors and staff of the NHS particularly Moorfields Hospital. Were there to be any
change, he would of course make a further statement."
After the Andrew Marr Show late last month, senior Labour officials accused the BBC of smearing the Prime Minister.
However, the BBC defended the tactics and a spokesman said: "Andrew was asking a legitimate question about the
health of the leader of the country." The spokesman refused to be drawn on whether Mr Marr and Barney Jones, the
editor of the programme, had consulted executives at the BBC before deciding to ask Mr Brown whether he was taking
prescription medication.
Later Lord Mandelson, the Business Secretary, said it was "absolutely ridiculous" to suggest the Mr Brown had a

S message just played as part of opening ceremony. It was very well received. WFP's Amb Ken Quinn discussed the
Secretary's powerful statement in June when the winner of this year's prize was announced. Quinn went on to say that
"I have been working on these issues for over 32 years, and I think that the Secretary understands these issues and is
more committed to fighting hunger than any of her predecessors". Meeting off to a good start.

111th Congress - First Session
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) is
recognized for 5 minutes.

Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my longstanding commitment to assist the Haitian people in
their pursuit of a stable, prosperous and democratic future.
During my trip to Haiti, I was reminded of the tremendous challenges facing this island nation. The U.N.'s appointment
of President Clinton as special envoy to Haiti has helped to keep a much-needed spotlight on Haiti. President Clinton's
appointment of Dr. Paul Farmer as the Deputy U.N. Special Envoy for Haiti, adds an invaluable wealth of experience and
knowledge to the U.N.'s work in Haiti.
As a founder of Partners in Health and the Institute for Justice & Democracy in Haiti, Dr. Farmer has demonstrated a
selfless commitment to the advancement of health and democracy in Haiti for the past 20 years. I have witnessed
firsthand Dr. Farmer's dedication to helping improve the lives of those in need.
He has strong south Florida ties. I am proud to call him a friend, along with our mutual friend, Jennie Block, who has also
worked so hard on issues of concern to the Haitian community.
I understand that the conference on the Inter-American Development Bank in Haiti went quite well. I was pleased to see
that the United Nations voted unanimously this week to extend the authorization for the U.N. Mission in Haiti for
another year.
I would also like to take a moment to express my condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in last
weekend's plane crash during a U.N. mission. The U.N. mission in Haiti has helped to play an important role in bringing
security and stability to some of the most dangerous neighborhoods in Haiti. I continue to support its mission and the
many men and women from around the world who work to carry it out.
However, it seems that Haiti just can't get to the next step. From assistance to debt relief, from trade benefits to
hurricane recovery, U.S. policy toward Haiti has run the gamut, but it is not achieving the long-term goals that we had
hoped for for the Haitian people and that the Haitian people want for themselves and their nation.
I am pleased to know that our State Department is taking a closer look at some of the challenges we are facing in Haiti.
Last week, Secretary Clinton's chief of staff and her point person on Haiti briefed Members on some of the initial
findings of this review.
I am confident that this review will help us to better understand how U.S. assistance to Haiti can be better targeted and
supportive of Haiti's own plans and goals; how assistance within the donor community can be better coordinated; how
the U.S. can better engage the Haitian Diaspora in our assistance efforts; and, finally, how the U.S. can finally make our
assistance sustainable so that outside efforts can ultimately be transferred into the hands of the Haitian government
and its people.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760221 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760221 Date: 06/30/2015
It is crucial that the efforts made by the U.S., the U.N. and others are effectively coordinated to ensure maximum
efficiency and maximum benefit for the people of Haiti. Innovative microcredit and microenterprise programs would
help to empower individuals, create self-reliance and create sustainability at the grassroots level. We should also look at
the very small-scale renewable energy programs for impoverished rural villages and settlements that are not served by
electric grids.
One of the immediate ways we can help the people of Haiti would be to grant temporary protected status to the
Haitians currently living in the U.S. Granting TPS to Haitians is the missing piece of a successful U.S. approach to
supporting the people of Haiti in the short and long term. I will continue to work with my colleagues to encourage the
administration to take this important step.
In addition, I will continue to support Haiti's inclusion in security initiatives, such as the Merida Initiative, to ensure that
the U.S. is doing all we can to help President Preval in his efforts against the narcotr:
affickers.
Success in Haiti is in the U.S. national security interest, and we must work together to help address the many challenges
we face and that our Caribbean neighbor faces day in and day out.

and allegedly overnight at the residence of the Libyan PermRep in Englewood. Rothman has called our office directly
and threatened holy war and Fox news "if the State Department allows this." A few minutes ago we also got a letter
from Sen. Lautenberg to the Secretary expressing similar concerns. The anger is of course over the "hero's welcome" for
Megrahi. An action memo for Jim to consider on how to deal with Qaddafi's visit is in the works, but I fear Rothman will
head for the microphones before Jim gets the memo.

Cheryl,
We spoke with 10, EEB, and Amb. Cousin after the meeting today and came up with the following revision to S's call
points. We decided the best language would be for the Secretary to say that if UNSYG cannot co-host, that she would
welcome the participation of his representative. The important point here is that we do not want the FAO head —
Jacques Diouf — to end-up co-hosting the UNGA event, and everyone agreed there was a danger Ban ki-Moon would
suggest he do so. In the background at the bottom I included a point stressing that we do not want Diouf to co-host.
Thanks,
Marisa

Eap is asking you to call Thai foreign minister kasit regarding the case of the russian arms dealer viktor bout. Are you ok

Below is call sheet and I also faxed to the house.
Purpose of Call: To underscore the importance we place on a the Royal Thai Government's successful appeal of the
court decision rejecting the extradition of Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout to the United States and the importance of
his continued detention pending the outcome of the appeal.
Background: On August 11, 2009, a Thai judge denied a U.S. extradition request of accused arms smuggler Viktor Bout
(pron: BOOT) to face trial in New York for conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals and officers; acquire and use anti-aircraft
missiles; and provide material support to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The Thai Attorney
General's Office will appeal the ruling. FM Kasit has been a strong ally on Burma and released a forward-leaning
Chairman's statement on behalf of ASEAN following ASSK's conviction.

Beihl called me from the plane just before departure. De facto negotiating team will return to DC Wednesday for
several days talks. While ministers were discouraged by de factor regime intransigence, Beihl said that Zelaya had also
lost some support. He said that all the ministers were shocked by Zelaya's behavior in a telephone conference call just
before their press conference this afternoon. Zelaya spoke of people dying by hundreds, being thrown in jail and
tortured. Zelaya appeared to be very out-of-touch, Beihl said. He added that "even" the Argentine FM was questioning
whether Z's return was the correct course. Beihl said that while a democratic solution was needed, perhaps Zelaya was
not the right option. I again expressed our position that the problem was not who replaced Zelaya, but that he was
removed unconstitutionally.
News conference was straightforward. Only one minister spoke (I don't know them by face), said that the solution was
return to democratic order and the regime not prepared to accept Si. I haven't got hold of transcript yet, will do so
asap.
Beihl again expressed thanks for our move on visas (as well as our logistical support), saying that all the ministers
thought it a good move.

Torture on homefront cries out for justice
Comments <http://www.suntimes.com/news/marin/1734591,CST-EDT-caro126.article>
August 26, 2009
BY CAROL MARIN <mailto:cmarin@suntimes.com> Sun-Times Columnist
The feds can't -- just yet -- deport Michigan restaurateur Ibrahim Parlak to his native Turkey. But they are frighteningly
closer.
And the irony screams out.
Carol Mann
On Monday, the same day Eric Holder, President Obama's attorney general, announced he would appoint a special
counsel to investigate whether torture was used by the CIA to extract confessions from foreign suspects, a U.S. appeals
court at the behest of the U.S. government ruled that it didn't have a problem sending Parlak back to the country where
he was tortured -- imprisoned for 17 months, shocked with electrodes, hung by his arms and sexually violated.
A Turkish Kurd, Parlak was granted political asylum in 1992. It was before our government got cozier with Turkey, before
it re-classified some of the Kurdish separatist movement as "terrorist" and before the attacks of Sept. 11. With 9/11,
Ibrahim Parlak's horror began anew.
Suddenly he looked different to the newly created Department of Homeland Security and to the Justice Department's
Immigration courts. Instead of seeing a hard-working, tax-paying Chamber of Commerce member who ran Cafe Gulistan,
a small Middle Eastern restaurant in the resort town of Harbert, Mich., tlie feds now saw an international menace.
In 2004, the FBI grabbed Parlak and locked him up.
If it hadn't been for a volunteer team of lawyers, including a Reagan-appointed former U.S. attorney, a former FBI anti-
terrorism legal adviser and the bipartisan intervention of Michigan's Sen. Carl Levin, a liberal Democrat, and Rep. Fred
Upton, a conservative Republican, Parlak would still be in jail.
Thanks to them, this 47-year-old father of a 12-year-old girl is temporarily free. But just barely.
The newest outrage is the 2-1 decision issued by Cincinnati's 6th Circuit Court of Appeals on the same day Holder
launched his torture inquiry.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760248 Date: 06/30/2015
The majority opinion was issued by two Bush appointees put on the bench after 9/11. Judge Julia Smith Gibbons and
Judge Jeffrey Sutton upheld the Justice Department's Immigration courts ruling that Parlak failed to disclose his
relationship to the now-labeled terrorist organization even though he was never proven to be a member.
Let's remember something about our immigration courts. They are not independent. They work for whoever is the
attorney general. And the past rulings against Parlak came under two now-controversial Bush appointees, John Ashcroft
and Alberto Gonzales.
The fairness of immigration rulings has been ripped by none other than Judge Richard Posner of the 7th Circuit Court of
Appeals, one of the nation's most brilliant judges. By September of 2005, Posner noted "a staggering 40 percent of the
136 petitions" had been reversed due to, according to one ruling, a willingness to ignore "the most basic of facts."
Echoing Posner now is the dissenting judge on the Parlak appeal. Judge Boyce F. Martin, a Carter appointee, writes with
both clarity and conviction, arguing the government's "awesome power was used here to railroad a man out of our
country."
Like a surgeon, Martin dissects the Justice Department's immigration courts and the majority opinion of his own
colleagues, and ends by saying, "I remain hopeful, nevertheless, that this case is but a sad remnant of an era of paranoid,
overzealous, error-riddled and misguided anti-terrorism and immigration enforcement that has now gone by the
wayside. It is just a shame that, even if my hope proves true, it is too late for Ibrahim Parlak."
Parlak's legal team will appeal.
Meanwhile, Holder, like Ashcroft and Gonzales before him, is the new boss of the immigration courts.
As he investigates questions of U.S. torture abroad, here's hoping Holder examines the ongoing domestic legal torture of
Ibrahim Parlak.

Subject: Another perspective
The following is from an observer who I think is right about the need for more strategy time which means we have to
have a better balance about travel time. I'd like your reactions. Thx.
"When it comes to foreign policy, all see you doing a great job. You must be literally killing yourself— I can see your
schedule is bruising. But you probably need more strategy time, less events as the ultimate judgment will be on •
whether iran, nk get the bomb, progress in Mideast, success in Afghanistan, Iraq. Obama's pause on Afghanistan goes
well with elite media and left that is against all wars, but not with swing male voters who are defecting. And I think it is
making the rest of your job much tougher because the delay in the decision is looking Carterlike to US adversaries — any
decision is better than no decision. But all roads likely lead to Iran and perhaps Pakistan, rest is secondary at this point.
That's my view for what it's worth. Take care.

I know you're embarked on another big trip and wish you well.
I met with Reema Navatany, Ela Bhatt's right hand, whom you know. She sends her greetings and underscored again
what you mean to them. SEWA is on the cutting edge of so many exciting developments.
We had a great conversation on many things, including how much women in the developing world can and must do to
address climate change and drive low tech green industries. In the villages, I could feel the pollution in my eyes and
throat -- so much needs to be done at the local level. Much pollution is produced because of the way women cook, etc.
When I get back, will work up some ideas on this. Delhi's been enshrouded in smog for the last couple days.
The SEWA project I visited 2 hours outside of Delhi was so impressive. Women who were among the poorst of the poor
had become businesswomen capable of traveling to London and Brussels to negotiate contracts with companies for
their embroidery etc We're going to have SEWA play a key role in the Vital Voices summit that you announced that will
take place here next year.
Maria Otero was still here when - arrived so she joined me for the SEWA mtgs.
I also went to one of Rushira Gupta's antitrafficking projects. You know her as we've been working with her thru WH
years. She got the global citizens award at CGI this year. I don't think I've seen worse conditions than what she's trying to
address. In Mumbai we launched an anti- trafficking campaign with Bollywood which brought in new players to the
cause.
Tomw, I will be speaking on this year's World Economic Forum Gender Gap report for India. There's so much potential
for India's economic growth -- as the WEF points out --- if they'd tap women's potential here. India is last of the BRIC
countries on most indicators and comes out poorly generally. Will be raising some of these issues with govt in Dialogue
mtgs.
Anyway, I thought of you so much everywhere I went. I'm so happy to be part of your legacy on these issues.
Travel well.

Could you please pass the following to HRC. Thanks. Joe
Dear Madame Secretary,
When we last spoke at the Corporate Council on Africa you were kind enough to invite me to pay a call on you when in
DC. As it turns out, I will be in Washington for most of next week, arriving the afternoon of the 16th and returning to
Santa Fe the evening of the 20th ( the return is flexible if you were available to see me over the weekend.) I realize that
you are traveling this week and possibly into next, but I wanted to reach out to you. As I wrote to you earlier, I am a
director for Symbion Power and may soon assume more direct responsibility for all of Africa as Symbion expands there
from its current operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Symbion's competitive advantage is its reliance on local partnering
and human capacity development in the execution of its projects. Its success in the most difficult and dangerous
environments has been very impressive, as the four minute video that Sid gave to you on my behalf demonstrates. We
now want to bring that business model and philosophy to Africa where the social entrepreneurship and the
development of skilled labor is imperative for Africa's long term economic prospects, as you have so forcefully
articulated in past comments.
I am very enthusiastic about
Symbion. It is one or the very few American companies outside the petroleum sector willing to establish itself and to

Samuel J. Heyman, who stood out as a corporate raider who preferred to hold on to companies he bought and run them
rather that sell them for a quick profit, died Sunday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 70.
Mr. Heyman's death was confirmed by his wife, Ronnie, who said he had died after complications from open heart
surgery.
Mr. Heyman was most recently chairman of the GAF Corporation, a manufacturer of roofing materials, and a chemical
company that was spun off from GAF, called International Specialty Products. Both companies are based in Wayne, N.J.
A group led by Mr. Heyman bought GAF in 1983 and took it private in 1987 after the stock market crashed. He later spun
off GAF's chemical business into a separate company, I.S.P.
During that period, corporate raiders tended to buy companies, cut operational costs and then sell them at a profit. But
after Mr. Heyman won a battle with GAF's management for control of the company, he told The New York Times: "There
is a very strong potential in chemicals, and we plan to make them grow."
Mr. Heyman, who was also a lawyer, had diverse business holdings, including Heyman Properties, which owns shopping
malls in the Northeast and which grew out of a business he had inherited from his father.
"He was extremely methodical. There was a rhyme and reason to everything he did," said Leon Black, the chairman of
Apollo Management, a private equity firm, and a longtime friend who was once Mr. Heyman's investment banker.
Mr. Black added: "He combined a strong legal background with a strong analytical business strength, and he was a fierce
negotiator. But what really made Sam kick was that he was a builder. It was all about building, whether it was his
companies, his real estate, his art collection or his family."
Mr. Heyman was born March 1, 1939, in Danbury, Conn., to Annette and Lazarus Heyman. His father was a real estate
developer. After graduating from Yale in 1960 and Harvard Law School in 1964, Mr. Heyman went to work in the Justice
Department under Robert F. Kennedy and served as chief assistant United States attorney for Connecticut. He had to cut
that career short when his father needed him to take over the real estate development business.
Mr. Heyman made his biggest mark in the 1983 battle for GAF. A group of shareholders led by Mr. Heyman became
frustrated by management's resistance to selling some of its biggest assets, including the chemicals business.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760283 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760283 Date: 06/30/2015
Mr. Heyman waged an aggressive campaign against the company's chairman and ultimately forced his removal through
a shareholder vote - a rare victory for shareholders during a time when executives of public companies were considered
virtually untouchable.
Once Mr. Heyman took control of GAF, he reversed course and held on to the chemicals business, ultimately making it a
big contributor to the company's profit.
He also moved quickly to cut costs and revamp the business, saying at the time that he was an "impatient man. When I
see a place where money can be saved, I don't waste time."
Mr. Heyman also gave away money. In 1999, he founded the Partnership for Public Service, which provides fellowships
to encourage students to pursue careers in public service. For his charity work, Mr. Heyman won the President's Citizens
Award in 2008.
His other philanthropic interests included the establishment of the Samuel and Ronnie Heyman Center on Corporate
Governance at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law.
He and his wife also collected art. Among their holdings are works by Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock.
In addition to his wife, the former Ronnie Feuerstein, Mr. Heyman is survived by his mother, Annette Heyman of Palm
Beach, Fla.; four children, Lazarus Heyman, Eleanor Propp, Jennifer Millstone and Elizabeth Winter; and nine
grandchildren.

Mr. Heyman was most recently chairman of the GAF Corporation, a manufacturer of roofing materials, and a chemical
company that was spun off from GAF, called International Specialty Products. Both companies are based in Wayne, N.J.
A group led by Mr. Heyman bought GAF in 1983 and took it private in 1987 after the stock market crashed. He later spun
off GAF's chemical business into a separate company, I.S.P.

During that period, corporate raiders tended to buy companies, cut operational costs and then sell them at a profit. But
after Mr. Heyman won a battle with GAF's management for control of the company, he told The New York Times: "There
is a very strong potential in chemicals, and we plan to make them grow."
Mr. Heyman, who was also a lawyer, had diverse business holdings, including Heyman Properties, which owns shopping
malls in the Northeast and which grew out of a business he had inherited from his father.
"He was extremely methodical. There was a rhyme and reason to everything he did," said Leon Black, the chairman of
Apollo Management, a private equity firm, and a longtime friend who was once Mr. Heyman's investment banker.
Mr. Black added: "He combined a strong legal background with a strong analytical business strength, and he was a fierce
negotiator. But what really made Sam kick was that he was a builder. It was all about building, whether it was his
companies, his real estate, his art collection or his family."
Mr. Heyman was born March 1, 1939, in Danbury, Conn., to Annette and Lazarus Heyman. His father was a real estate
developer. After graduating from Yale in 1960 and Harvard Law School in 1964, Mr. Heyman went to work in the Justice
Department under Robert F. Kennedy and served as chief assistant United States attorney for Connecticut. He had to cut
that career short when his father needed him to take over the real estate development business.
Mr. Heyman made his biggest mark in the 1983 battle for GAF. A group of shareholders led by Mr. Heyman became
frustrated by management's resistance to selling some of its biggest assets, including the chemicals business.
Mr. Heyman waged an aggressive campaign against the company's chairman and ultimately forced his removal through
a shareholder vote - a rare victory for shareholders during a time when executives of public companies were considered
virtually untouchable.
Once Mr. Heyman took control of GAF, he reversed course and held on to the chemicals business, ultimately making it a
big contributor to the company's profit.
He also moved quickly to cut costs and revamp the business, saying at the time that he was an "impatient man. When I
see a place where money can be saved, I don't waste time."
Mr. Heyman also gave away money. In 1999, he founded the Partnership for Public Service, which provides fellowships
to encourage students to pursue careers in public service. For his charity work, Mr. Heyman won the President's Citizens
Award in 2008.
His other philanthropic interests included the establishment of the Samuel and Ronnie Heyman Center on Corporate
Governance at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law.
He and his wife also collected art. Among their holdings are works by Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock.
In addition to his wife, the former Ronnie Feuerstein, Mr. Heyman is survived by his mother, Annette Heyman of Palm
Beach, Fla.; four children, Lazarus Heyman, Eleanor Propp, Jennifer Millstone and Elizabeth Winter; and nine
grandchildren.

Dear Hillary,
I too am sorry not to be able to see you this time. I am currently making about one trip a month to DC for Symbion, so I
am sure there will be an opportunity in the near future. I hesitate to pester you personally so if there is somebody I can
work through to coordinate a time please let me know or have them drop me a note. My schedule is much more flexible

By the way I just returned from Angola. Your stop there was a big hit. I found Luanda to be fascinating and much

exercising that power through their husbands. How refreshing. Valerie speaks to Women's Voices tonight and in.
prepping has been reading "Half the Sky" which reinforces everything you and Melanne have been fighting for for years.
When I gave my ambassadorial farewell address in Gabon in 1995 I made a point of saying that if I were the God of
development assistance I would do only one thing: give all the money to the women and then sit back and watch them
drive African economies forward. I hope you succeed in pushing the world in that direction. I don't know of a more

The Independent
November 12, 2009
Has Cameron done a deal with Murdoch?
By Andy McSmith
Lord Mandelson's attack shines spotlight on Tory leader's links with media mogul
David Cameron has been accused of making a "contract" with Britain's biggest media company to trade political support
before an election for government favours afterwards if the Tories win.
The accusation was levelled yesterday by the Business Secretary Peter Mande!son, who is increasingly the public face of
Gordon Brown's government. Ministers are angry at the campaign that The Sun has run against the Prime Minister all
this week over the spelling mistakes in a letter Mr Brown sent to the mother of a young soldier killed in Afghanistan.
They suspect that the Conservative Party has been tailoring its policies on media regulation and the BBC to suit the
commercial interests of News International, which owns The Sun, and that the paper's aggressive support for the Tories
is a pay-off that could spread to other parts of the mass media.
Examples of the apparent tie-in between what News International's boss, James Murdoch, wants, and what David
Cameron is ready to promise include the recent decision by the Conservatives to abandon the idea of "top slicing" the
BBC licence fee. It had been proposed that part of the money paid to the BBC would be siphoned off to help regional
television companies meet the threat from the Internet. But this would also have helped them compete more effectively
against Sky News, which is part of the Murdoch media empire.
When the policy was abandoned in September, Jeremy Hunt, the shadow Culture Secretary, said that it was because
enacting it might make the commercial television companies "focus not on attracting viewers but on attracting
subsidies". There was no gain for the BBC in the climbdown, because David Cameron had already said that the Tories will
freeze the licence fee. What it will mean is that the BBC's income will be capped, without the regional television
companies seeing any government help, which will strengthen the market position of Britain's only satellite television
company, Sky. "This was done for News International," a Tory insider said yesterday. "Murdoch wants Sky to go head to
head with the BBC. He doesn't want the independent companies strengthened."
In April 2008, James Murdoch complained bitterly about the media regulator Ofcom in his first major speech after taking
over as chief executive of News Corporation in Europe and Asia. The following year, David Cameron announced that a
Conservative government would cut Ofcom down to size.
Last summer James Murdoch attacked the "abysmal record" of the BBC Trust - the body created by Labour to over see
the BBC - in a lecture he gave at the Edinburgh Festival, singling out its "total failure" to stop the BBC buying the Lonely

Planet travel guides, a takeover that Murdoch denounced as an "egregious" invasion of private enterprise by the state.
Less than two months later, Jeremy Hunt promised that the Tories would abolish the Trust.
In the same lecture, Murdoch complained that BBC performers like Jonathan Ross are being paid salaries that "no
commercial competitor can afford". He had barely uttered the words before Ed Vaizey, a shadow media minister,
promised that a Tory government would compel the BBC to publish the salaries of its top performers.
Lord Mandelson alleged yesterday that the Conservatives and News International had "effectively formed a contract,
over the head, incidentally, of the newspaper's editor and their readers, in which they are sort of bound to one
another".
Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, he added: "What The Sun can do for the Conservatives during the election is
one part of the contract and, presumably, what the Conservatives can do for News International if they are elected is the
other side of the bargain. But there is a wider question. When The Sun creates the news in this way, this is then followed
up by Sky News, which then puts pressure on the BBC to follow suit."
This was "absolutely, categorically" denied yesterday by The Sun's political editor, Tom Newton Dunn, who accused Lord
Mandelson of talking "preposterous nonsense".
The Sun, which supported Labour through three general elections under Tony Blair's leadership, announced that it was
jumping ship on the day that Gordon Brown delivered his annual speech.to the Labour Party conference in September.
Its onslaught on Gordon Brown for the mistakes made in a handwritten letter to Jacqui Janes is the most aggressive
attack that the newspaper has directed at any Labour Party leader since Neil Kinnock stood down after losing the 1992
general election, a defeat for which The Sun claimed victory with the slogan "It was The Sun wot won it".
But there were signs yesterday that the attack may have rebounded on The Sun. Mr Brown, who is blind in one eye, has
admitted that his handwriting is bad and has apologised to Mrs Janes, whose 20-year-old son, Jamie, was killed by a
makeshift bomb in Afghanistan last month.
A poll yesterday for the website PoliticsHome, whose main shareholder is the Conservative Party deputy chairman Lord
Ashcroft, found that 65 per cent of those polled thought that The Sun's attack was "inappropriate" compared with 23
per cent who thought it was "legitimate".
The closeness of the new Tory-Sun axis is shown up by the revelation, from an inside source, that David Cameron
personally consulted the editor of The Sun, Dominic Mohan, in three separate conversations before he abandoned his
"cast-iron" promise to hold a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty, now that all 27 members states of the EU have ratified it.
Mr Cameron was understandably wary of how The Sun might react to the abandonment of that promise. The paper has
campaigned for years against what it sees as the growth of an EU superstate. It was in an open letter to readers of The
Sun that Cameron first made his guarantee, two years ago.
His announcement that a referendum is off the agenda was subjected to a scathing attack in the Daily Mail, but in The
Sun it was given kid-glove treatment under the headline "Cameron's crusade for UK rights".
The person behind this aggressively pro-Tory policy is James Murdoch, not his father, Rupert, who created The Sun
virtually from scratch in the 1970s. Rupert Murdoch claimed in an interview with Sky News Australia that he "regretted"
his son's decision to turn against Gordon Brown, "who is a friend of mine", but defended it on the grounds that Brown
has been a "disappointment".
Yesterday, The Times, another Murdoch newspaper, announced that its veteran political editor, Phil Webster, is leaving
the Commons, where he h8 been based for decades. Mr Webster is very well thought of by New Labour. His
replacement, Roland Watson, was a friend of David Cameron's at Eton but has no political ties with the Tories.
Tom Newton Dunn, newly appointed as The Sun's political editor, is another Old Etonian. His father, Bill, used to be a
Tory MEP, but defected to the Liberal Democrats in 2000.

Torture on homefront cries out for justice
Comments <http://www.suntimes.com/news/marin/1734591,CST-EDT-caro126.article>
August 26, 2009
BY CAROL MARIN <mailto:cmarin@suntimes.com> Sun-Times Columnist
The feds can't -- just yet -- deport Michigan restaurateur Ibrahim Parlak to his native Turkey. But they are frighteningly
closer.
And the irony screams out.
Carol Mann
On Monday, the same day Eric Holder, President Obama's attorney general, announced he would appoint a special
counsel to investigate whether torture was used by the CIA to extract confessions from foreign suspects, a U.S. appeals
court at the behest of the U.S. government ruled that it didn't have a problem sending Parlak back to the country where
he was tortured -- imprisoned for 17 months, shocked with electrodes, hung by his arms and sexually violated.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760312 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760312 Date: 06/30/2015
A Turkish Kurd, Parlak was granted political asylum in 1992. It was before our government got cozier with Turkey, before
it re-classified some of the Kurdish separatist movement as "terrorist" and before the attacks of Sept. 11. With 9/11,
Ibrahim Parlak's horror began anew.
Suddenly he looked different to the newly created Department of Homeland Security and to the Justice Department's
Immigration courts. Instead of seeing a hard-working, tax-paying Chamber of Commerce member who ran Cafe Gulistan,
a small Middle Eastern restaurant in the resort town of Harbert, Mich., the feds now saw an international menace.
In 2004, the FBI grabbed Parlak and locked him up.
If it hadn't been for a volunteer team of lawyers, including a Reagan-appointed former U.S. attorney, a former FBI anti-
terrorism legal adviser and the bipartisan intervention of Michigan's Sen. Carl Levin, a liberal Democrat, and Rep. Fred
Upton, a conservative Republican, Parlak would still be in jail.
Thanks to them, this 47-year-old father of a 12-year-old girl is temporarily free. But just barely.
The newest outrage is the 2-1 decision issued by Cincinnati's 6th Circuit Court of Appeals on the same day Holder
launched his torture inquiry.
The majority opinion was issued by two Bush appointees put on the bench after 9/11. Judge Julia Smith Gibbons and
Judge Jeffrey Sutton upheld the Justice Department's Immigration courts ruling that Parlak failed to disclose his
relationship to the now-labeled terrorist organization even though he was never proven to be a member.
Let's remember something about our immigration courts. They are not independent. They work for whoever is the
attorney general. And the past rulings against Parlak came under two now-controversial Bush appointees, John Ashcroft
and Alberto Gonzales.
The fairness of immigration rulings has been ripped by none other than Judge Richard Posner of the 7th Circuit Court of
Appeals, one of the nation's most brilliant judges. By September of 2005, Posner noted "a staggering 40 percent of the
136 petitions" had been reversed due to, according to one ruling, a willingness to ignore "the most basic of facts."
Echoing Posner now is the dissenting judge on the Parlak appeal. Judge Boyce F. Martin, a Carter appointee, writes with
both clarity and conviction, arguing the government's "awesome power was used here to railroad a man out of our
country."
Like a surgeon, Martin dissects the Justice Department's immigration courts and the majority opinion of his own
colleagues, and ends by saying, "I remain hopeful, nevertheless, that this case is but a sad remnant of an era of paranoid,
overzealous, error-riddled and misguided anti-terrorism and immigration enforcement that has now gone by the
wayside. It is just a shame that, even if my hope proves true, it is too late for Ibrahim Parlak."
Parlak's legal team will appeal.
Meanwhile, Holder, like Ashcroft and Gonzales before him, is the new boss of the immigration courts.
As he investigates questions of U.S. torture abroad, here's hoping Holder examines the ongoing domestic legal torture of
Ibrahim Parlak.

November 09, 2009 —
The twentieth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9 has become, in the minds and pronouncements
of many, a celebration of Ronald Reagan's starring role in the demise of the Evil Empire. For example, a new book by
Romesh Ratnesar (Tear Down This Wall: A City, a President, and the Speech that Ended the Cold War) argues that the
four-word dare that Reagan hurled at Mikhail Gorbachev in June 1987 catalyzed the forces that led to collapse of the
East German regime a little more than two years later. In a speech that Newt Gingrich gave on the anniversary titled,
"The Victory of the Cross: How Spiritual Renewal Helped Topple the Berlin Wall," he was expected to say that Reagan's
"constant moral and material support for the cause of freedom" undermined the Iron Curtain.
But the real world-historical hero of that whole episode was Mikhail Gorbachev himself. If he had lost out in 1985 to any
of his rivals for the top job in the Kremlin—the Moscow or Leningrad party chiefs, for example—we'd probably still have
a cold war and, quite possibly, a divided Berlin. Gorbachev, now 78, made an appearance at the commemorative
ceremonies in Berlin on Monday, as did Russian President Dimitri Medvedev.
Two other decisive figures were Reagan's and Gorbachev's successors.
President George H.W. Bush served as a calm—and calming—air traffic controller, guiding an increasingly dispirited
Gorbachev as he piloted the Soviet state in for a soft landing on the ash heap of history.

And had Boris Yeltsin not stood up to the hard-line communists who briefly ousted Gorbachev in 1991, the Soviet
Union—and the Soviet system—might have survived. In which case, there might still have been a celebration of freedom
in Berlin this week, but there would probably not have been anyone from Moscow in attendance.

Sept 6-7 Pakistan
Lew, Verma, Campbell, Paul Jones and Sean Misko (SRAP), possibly David Robinson (PRM)
Sept 8-9 Afghanistan
Lew, Verma, Campbell, Paul Jones and Sean Misko (SRAP), possibly David Robinson (PRM)
Hooking up with Acting AID Administration Alonzo Fulgham for a portion of the trip
Sept 10 Brussels (am)
Washington (pm)
As discussed very briefly with PJ and Ian this am., Jack floated the idea of having a journalist accompany us.
Alternatively, we are very focused on both international and local journalists, esp in India and Af/Pak.
Not planning to do media in Iraq or Brussels.
Very open to doing something in advance of trip (though hard to squeeze in Mon/Tues) and upon return.

POTUS Asia Travel
Bill said he will be meeting with his Indonesian counterpart today to discuss.
Helicopter support for Emb Baghdad
Pat Kennedy noted that Blackwater's contract ends Sept. 4, but problems have arisen with the successor being
ready to assume helo support tasks; they have not secured the necessary helos nor obtained the required certificates of
airworthiness and are in breach of their contract. Rather than shut down Embassy operations after Sept. 4, it may be
necessary to give Blackwater a short (perhaps 2 months) extension until the successor is ready to perform. M is talking
to Chris Hill about our options; he would need to discuss this with the Iraqis if Blackwater is extended.

Rich Verma noted the planned demonstration in Englewood, New Jersey this weekend in opposition to Qaddafi's
desire to stay there during UNGA. There is now a possibility that Qaddafi will stay at a hotel in Manhattan. Bill will talk
to Jeff Feltman and hopes this will be resolved today; if so, H said they would inform Rep. Rothman and Senator
La uten berg.
Hearings
Rich reported that Chris Hill is scheduled to appear before the SFRC on Sept 9 and the HFAC on Sept 10, perhaps
with Gen. Odierno, although Odierno may not be available those dates. There was discussion of the pros and cons of
appearing with or without Gen. Odierno, given past precedent on Iraq and Afghanistan testimony and the general rule
that ambassadors usually do not testify on the Hill.
Upcoming confirmation hearings include those for Bob Hormats on Sept 9, perhaps with Jose Fernandez, and a
panel of EUR ambassadorial-nominees on Sept 10. Also, Richard Holbrooke will testify on Sept 15 before the House
Foreign Operations subcommittee.
Honduras
Harold Koh raised the memo to the Secretary on Honduras; it was decided to discuss it in a separate meeting.

Harold also noted the issue of
D(L) Travel
Piper said Jack Lew will return to the office Monday and depart on travel Tuesday afternoon, returning Sept 10.

Bela rus at UNGA
• Jake noted the issue of whether to invite Belarus to the President's reception at UNGA; the consensus was that he
should do so.
Public Affairs
Ian Kelly said PA anticipates questions on Honduras, upcoming Mitchell meetings, and the possibility of a Bosworth
trip at today's briefing. PJ Crowley noted European press reporting of comments by former UK FS Jack Straw that the
British had not provided assurances to us in the 90's that the convicted Lockerbie bomber would serve out his full

concern is also growing stronger. I would propose a statement from PJ, along the lines of the one below, but am open

I was just talking to Mark Landler and relayed at the behest of the IG that they wanted to be sure Mark understood that
the current IG inspection of Kabul is routine and that it always includes a leadership/management survey of the boss.
Mark laughed and said he understood that, because of his knowledge of the inspection that is wrapping up in my
bureau. It is why he put mention of the inspection at the tail end of the story.

wold be most helpful. Feel free to drop, add, or otherwise change anything. Anyway, here is a first shot.
Best,

• ARKADELPHIA — Johnnie Mae Walker Spargo was born on the first day of Spring, March 20, 1919, and from that
day until her last on this earth, Nov. 8, 2009, she cast her beautiful blue eyes and dimpled smile on all of those around
her.
Johnnie Mae was the youngest daughter of Garland Lee and Nettie Mann Walker of Red Oak, Arkansas, now part of Hot
Springs on the southeast shores of Lake Hamilton. She was predeceased by her parents and siblings, Claude, Eddie,
Grady, Hansel, Clara, Isli, and Doyle. She was predeceased by her loving husband of 67 years, Stephen Fowler Spargo,
and by Jamie and Billy Gibbs, her daughter and sonin-law, and her son-in-law Allen Brown DeLamar. The Spargos, natives
of Hot Springs, made Arkadelphia home when Steve joined Reynolds Aluminum Company in 1954.
Mrs. Spargo is survived by her son and daughter-in-law, Byron and Mary Lynda Spargo, of Baton Rouge, La., and her
daughters, Nancy Spargo DeLamar, of Little Rock, and Dr. Linda Spargo, of Oxford, Miss. Her grandchildren include
Megan DeLamar Schroeder and her husband, Trey, of Texarkana; Hattie Alton of Oxford, Miss.; Johni Beth Gibbs and her
fiance Jeremy Teague of Sheridan; Gwendy Clingman and her husband, Ed, of Mechanicsville, Va.; and Leslie Spargo of
Baton Rouge. Johnnie Mae was especially proud of her great-grandchildren: Frances and Eleanor Schroeder and Ryan
and Lauren Clingman.
She was a fierce and loyal advocate for each and every one of her offspring and truly believed that they could be
anything in the world they wanted to be. She was a member of the First Methodist Church in Arkadelphia. Johnnie Mae
was a pre-school teacher for many years at Margo Nelson's Wonderland School in Arkadelphia. She also helped her
community as a constant and reliable election poll worker. Even though Johnnie Mae was determined that she not be
perceived as a retiring little granny, her family was her universe. She was a strong, vibrant woman with black hair coiffed
on top of her head and clicking high heels, and she had beautiful skin that all of her progeny hope to inherit. She
believed in living to the fullest until the end, doing good works, helping all whom she encountered in ways that she
could, and imbuing her children and grandchildren with a strong work ethic and deep empathy for those less fortunate.
Many people in Arkansas have been the recipient of one of her lemon butter pound cakes for doing something kind for
one of her girls. When she won the 2003 Clark County Democrat of the Year, Johnnie Mae was described as a cross
between Eva Peron and Mary Poppins.
Johnnie Mae made her mark on Arkadelphia, determined that her children would enjoy to the fullest the experiences
that the Norman Rockwellian setting provided. She threw herself into any endeavor that her children and grandchildren
wanted to pursue. When Becky Fuller, now Rebecca Ward, was the first person from the city to win a statewide election
at Girl's State, Johnnie Mae organized a city-wide homecoming celebration complete with a parade for all the
Arkadelphia delegates that included her daughter Nancy. When Johnnie Mae's daughter Jamie wanted to pursue rodeo
and barrel racing, Nonnie perfected her ability to sew cowgirl outfits while also cheering-on her daughter from the
stands. When her daughter Linda wanted to serve as a cheerleader for Arkadelphia High School and then Ouachita
Baptist University, Johnnie Mae and Steve's house became nerve-center for all events athletic. When daughter Nancy
returned to Arkadelphia in 1964 with seven-month-old Megan to raise, Johnnie and Steve provided a nurturing, loving
home for daughter and granddaughter. Megan was the grandchild who gave Johnnie Mae her proudest title: Johnnie
Mae became "Nonnie."
Nonnie was queen of a tribe of three generations of women known as "Spargo Girls." When her great-granddaughters
Frances and Eleanor were born in 1999, Nonnie was determined that the twin girls would not use an exclusive
communication method. Nonnie's special task was to talk with them extensively and one-on-one, making sure that the

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760369 Date: 06/30/2015
girls' first desire was to talk to her. Active in Democratic politics at all levels and with a passion, she was equally a
dedicated life master of duplicate bridge and played many a set with her friends at the House of Bridge in Hot Springs.
Johnnie ultimately spent most of her time driving to wherever one of her children lived to help with whatever tasks of
life needed tending. In response to this demanding schedule, she famously responded, "You can sleep when you are
dead!" Her stock question when confronted with news from one of her children of a pending event — whether one was
receiving an award or going out for lunch — was "Well, what will you wear?" Raising all these Spargo girls, she was
expert not only at re-upholstering an entire set of living room furniture, she also sewed countless, spontaneous-yet-
appropriate attire, from couture evening gowns to cowgirl wear. Making ball gowns from the draperies was not
exclusive to other southern heroines.
Perhaps Johnnie Mae's most endearing qualities were unfailing optimism combined with great pragmatism. She lived in
the present and did not believe in guilt or regrets. Born before women could vote, she cast one of her last votes for the
woman she hoped would be the first woman President. When Hillary did not prevail, she once again enjoyed casting a
vote for a straight Democratic ticket. Nonnie would want the family to express special gratitude for the many kindnesses
extended to her by the staff and nurses at Presbyterian Village in Little Rock, where she resided since June 2009. Thank
you is extended also to Arkansas Hospice whose compassion and care comforted both family and friends. Thanks are
also expressed to the staff of Home Instead and their compassionate caregiver, Bette White. John Lee Roberts of
Arkadelphia provided unwavering help and assistance and was a much loved friend and companion to both Steve and
Johnnie Mae.
The family will have a visitation at 9:30-10:30 a.m. Wednesday at Ruggles-Wilcox Funeral Home in Arkadelphia, followed
by a graveside service at 10:30 a.m. Wednesday at Rose Hill Cemetery led by Father Douglas Anderson of St. James
Episcopal Church, Texarkana. Memorials may be made to Arkansas Hospice, 5600 W 12th St., Little Rock, Ark. 72204;

Libyan Reps tell Rothman Quaddafi not coming to Englewood
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Friday, August 28, 2009 4:04 pm EST
Contact: Bob Decheine (202) 550-7869
Washington, D.C. based representatives of the Libyan government have informed Congressman Steve Rothman (D-NJ)
that Col. Moammar Quaddafi, will not be staying in Englewood, New Jersey if he comes to the United States for the
meeting of the United Nations General Assembly next month. This information has not yet been confirmed by the
White House or the State Department.
"I am very pleased that Moammar Quaddafi will apparently not be coming to Englewood. His appearance would have
presented unnecessary safety and security issues for the residents of Englewood and the Libyan diplomats," said
Rothman. I want to thank President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the literally dozens of their
appointees I have had the pleasure to work so closely with over the past seven days in achieving this result. I also want
to thank the Libyan government for their hard work and consideration in resolving this matter in such a positive
fashion."

Colleagues
On the assumption that the Department is ready to take the position that we will not permit him to use the NJ property,
recommend the following after consultations with the lawyers and experts who handle our "hostship" responsibilities
The Department of State has consulted with the Government of Libya regarding the impending visit of
Libyan President Muammar Qadhafi to
attend the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York.
In keeping with prior arrangements, the Englewood, New Jersey property is not available for any use in connection
with the upcoming visit
I don't think that we want/need to get into particulars about boroughs within NYC

Importance: High
Team — we really need something to go out today regarding Qadahfi's visit to the UNGA. There is a rally in NJ planned
for Sunday morning — that rally is growing in scope and impact as the time passes. The Congressional interest and
concern is also growing stronger. I would propose a statement from PJ, along the lines of the one below, but am open
to other ideas. Issuing something next week will not help us all that much.

As far as Afghanistan goes, we still do not know if a budget amendment will be going up next week or not. We should
know by Monday morning. Our staff has been asked to prepare a template without numbers so a decision could be
implemented quickly. I am confident that there will be time to have a discussion both at the highest levels at OMB and
the WH before this is locked. As far as the 2011 budget goes, we should hear back at least from staff early next week and
I will reach out to Peter and Rob to start a discussion at the top line level. I think we will want you to enagage some time
this coming week, but I would like to see what the real gap is first.

Dear Cheryl and Jake,
I wanted to let you know that after a great deal of soul-searching, I have decided to leave the State Department in about
a month.
This was an exceptionally difficult decision; one of the most difficult I have made in my life. It has been a honor and a
real joy to have been part of the team here at State; the past year has been one of the most enriching experiences of my
career. I am leaving only for personal reasons; after pushing myself as hard as I possibly could the last several years, I
need to do this for myself, to spend some time away from work with my family and friends and reenergize.
Thank you once again for the remarkable opportunity to serve our country and work for the Secretary. This has been a
rare privilege, and I cannot stress enough how appreciative I am. I hold the entire team here in the highest possible
regard.

This evening cloture was invoked on the motion to proceed to Majority Leader Reid's health care bill, 60 to 39.
It was a straight party line vote. Despite some early concern over how they would vote, Senators Ben Nelson, Landrieu,
and Lincoln voted with the caucus. Each has warned they're not a guaranteed "yes" vote on final passage.
Senators voted from their seats, and Senator Dodd sat in the chair during the vote. The vote was followed by brief
applause.
Per the UC agreement negotiated by Reid and McConnell, this evening's cloture vote will also double as the vote on the
underlying motion to proceed, meaning the Senate will recess after the vote and will be on the health care bill when it
returns from the Thanksgiving recess.

Just a brief update on the Senate health care debate.
The Senate will take its first vote on health care legislation Saturday night now that Leader Reid seems to have secured
the requisite votes to invoke cloture. The vote to invoke cloture will double as a vote on the motion to proceed,
allowing senators to head home for Thanksgiving recess following the 8 p.m. vote.
If cloture is invoked, Reid would immediately call up his bill as a substitute amendment to a House measure that will
serve as the shell for the motion to proceed vote. Senator Coburn had threatened to require the clerk to read the 2,000-
page bill following the vote on the motion to proceed, but Reid will call up the bill by number only, which prevents a
reading.
Whether Reid has the votes to break the filibuster Saturday hangs on three Democrats: Senators Lincoln, Landrieu, and
Ben Nelson. All three say they are undecided, but appear to indicate they are leaning toward voting in favor of cloture.

Reportedly Landrieu has been using her leverage to attempt to change the bill as it moves forward and won a
particularly sweet deal that could bring billions to Louisiana. Following 2005's Hurricane Katrina, Louisiana saw an
increase in per capita income, which led to a significant drop in federal Medicaid funding. Reid included language in the
bill that will increase funding by 50 percent of the total decrease.
You will recall that Senator Snowe was the only Republican to vote in favor of the Finance bill, but said she has too many
concerns with Reid's version to support the cloture vote Saturday.
Earlier this week, the CB0 scored the Reid bill. The CBO estimates the total cost of the legislation is $848 billion.
Below please find a copy of the President's statement on the roll out of Reid's legislation:
STATEMENT FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA ON THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT
"Today we passed another critical milestone in the health reform effort with the release of the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act. I was particularly pleased to see that the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the bill will
reduce the deficit by $127 billion over the next ten years and as much as $650 billion in the decade following, saving
hundreds of billions while extending coverage to 31 million more Americans.
From day one, our goal has been to enact legislation that offers stability and security to those who have insurance and
affordable coverage to those who don't, and that lowers costs for families, businesses and governments across the
country. Majority Leader Reid, Chairmen Baucus and Dodd, and countless Senators have worked tirelessly to craft
legislation that meets those principles.
Just yesterday, a bipartisan group of more than 20 leading health economists released a letter urging passage of
meaningful reform and praising four key provisions that are in the Senate legislation: a fee on insurance companies
offering high-premium plans, the establishment of an independent Medicare commission, reforms to the health care
delivery system, and overall deficit neutrality. The economists said that these provisions 'will reduce long-term deficits,
improve the quality of care, and put the nation on a firm fiscal footing.' Those are precisely the goals we should be
seeking to attain.
The challenges facing our health care system aren't new — but if we fail to act they'll surely get even worse, meaning
higher premiums, skyrocketing costs, and deeper instability for those with coverage. Today, thanks to the Senate's hard
work, we're closer than ever to enacting solutions to these problems.
I look forward to working with the Senate and House to get a finished bill to my desk as soon as possible."

Millennium Challenge Report
The Millennium Challenge Act of 2003 requires the submission of a report to Congress and publication in the Federal
Register of a list of countries that are candidate countries for MCC assistance, and countries that would be candidate
countries but for "specified legal prohibitions on assistance." Honduras is a candidate country. If Honduras is subject to
the restrictions in section 7008, it would be listed in that section of the report that identifies countries that would be

candidate countries but for legal prohibitions that prohibit assistance. The report would also provide an explanation of
the legal prohibition (in fact, other coup restricted countries, such as Cote d'Ivoire, Madagascar, Mauritania, and Sudan,
are on the prohibited list and section 7008 is explicitly mentioned).
The list must be approved by the Board of the MCC, of which the Secretary is the chair, and is due on 9/10. It is our
understanding that an action memo will be presented to the Secretary, perhaps as early as next week, so that she can
approve submission of the report. The action memo will require the Secretary to decide whether Honduras is a country
without a "specified legal prohibition" or whether such a prohibition has in fact attached.

I am travelling in New England this weekend but am available at or through the ops center if you wish to

Section 7008 of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2009 (Div. H,

"None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available pursuant to titles III through VI of this Act shall be

The cover note is merely an extended table of contents, and behind it are six 2- or 3-pagers on the six major questions

Congrats on your book; you must be very excited to see it in print after so much work. I'm looking forward to reading it.
And I hope you're working on the democracy/human rights speech I'm giving the week of the 7th. Are you?
Also, David Miliband told me that the UK lost more soldiers in the Falklands than they have in Afghanistan. Would you
pls verify that for me? Thx.
All the best, and Happy Thanksgiving! Hillary

Subject: cairo +15 speech in early january
About six weeks ago, HRC agreed to give a speech commemorating the anniversary of the 1994 UN Conference on
Population and Development in Cairo. I believe the actual anniversary is December 18th so frankly, if we did the
speech in early January, we would not be that far off the mark. The idea would be to do this speech at State with the
audience including the NG0s, Gates Foundation, UN, and Packard Foundations. This speech could send a message
regarding the link between population and environmental sustainability and as a result, improve women's status and
rights. I would love to give them January 6th-8th if that works on your end.

Today's announcement by the Government of Israel helps move forward toward resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
We believe that through good-faith negotiations the parties can mutually agree on an outcome which ends the conflict
and reconciles the Palestinian goal of an independent and viable state based on the 1967 lines, with agreed swaps, and
the Israeli goal of a Jewish state with secure and recognized borders that reflect subsequent developments and meet
Israeli security requirements. Let me say to all the people of the region and world: our commitment to achieving a

Re: Afghan/Western Alliance/UK
1. Happy Thanksgiving!
2. On the eve of the president's announcement on Afghanistan the Western alliance is near-broken. The obvious:
Your trip to NATO will be the final call on Afghanistan. Whatever you scrap together there will be the remains of the day.
There will be no more. The spare change in troops you pick up will be the close-out deal. The Europeans will be less
amenable to contributions in the future than the House Democratic Caucus.
3. Consensus across the board in Britain—center, right, left—is that the Atlantic alliance—the special relationship—
the historic bond since World War II—is shattered. There is no dissenting voice, not one, and there are no illusions.
Opinion is unanimous. The bottom line is that the Obama administration's denigration of the UK is seen as the
summation of the Bush era. Undoubtedly, you saw this week Minister of Defense Bob Ainsworth's public criticism of
Obama's indecision and his accusation that the president is indifferent and damaging to British interest. While Downing
Street sought to ameliorate his remarks with an oleaginous statement his view is simply What everyone—everyone-
thinks. His clumsy outburst was a classic gaffe—an embarrassing mistake because it reveals something true. The Chilcot
inquiry of Parliament, publicly conducting hearings on the origins of UK involvement in the Iraq invasion, has put Bush's
war on terror—and British involvement—on trial—and the calmly conducted but eviscerating hearings will go on for
another year. Blair is seen as either complicit on the basis of knowing there was no casus belli or as an enthusiastically
deceived tool. Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has stated that the reason support for the Afghanistan
mission has cratered is because of the lies told in the run-up to the Iraq war—another view universally held. Meanwhile,
former UK ambassador to the US Christopher Meyer has published his new book on the history of UK diplomacy with
concluding sections on the demise of the special relationship. He is not only being interviewed on all British media but

also has appeared as a voluble witness before the Chilcot commission. (I've included a report below.) All British
newspapers and journals have prominently published many pieces within the last week on the decline and fall of the US-
UK relationship. (I've included below the lead editorial today from the London Times and the cover story from the
Spectator—two of the most resolutely pro-American sources.) The tone is not resentful, but reserved, disdainful and
superior. The US administration is considered blinkered, parochial and counter-productive. Conservatives are more
contemptuous than Labour, which feels abandoned and somewhat baffled. Rather than eager to be Obama's poodle,
Cameron would be superficially friendly and privately scornful. Class has a lot to do with the contempt. A Cameron
government would be more aristocratic and even narrowly Etonian than any Conservative government in recent history,
sharply contrasting especially with the striving and classless perspective of the grocer's daughter, Margaret Thatcher.
And yet, and yet, the most recent poll this week showed Labour within striking distance of the Tories, about five points
down, the result of a slight economic uptick. A hung parliament seems very possible. Given the distribution of voting
patterns, Labour need not win a plurality to have more seats than the Tories. The slight buoyancy for Labour in this
unique situation has only heightened anxiety about Obama's Afghanistan process, which has excluded the British
government from significant consultation and consideration of its interests. (See the lead to Con Coughlin's Spectator
piece.) Therefore, you might contemplate a brief trip to London and public appearance with Brown on your way back
from Brussels.
4. On the Western alliance, beyond its military part, NATO, there is much more to say and develop, but later. Read
three pieces below:
From The Times
November 26, 2009
Atlantic drift
Washington's delay in announcing its Afghanistan strategy has left Brown drifting. Obama needs to invest more time and
attention in the transatlantic alliance President Obama declared on Tuesday that "the whole world" had a responsibility
to help the US-led mission in Afghanistan. He would, he said, soon lay out the "obligations of our international partners".
Those partners have been waiting a long time for the details. On Monday the President had his tenth meeting with his
advisers to work out his strategy for Afghanistan. He has now spent almost three months considering his options, and
has promised an announcement on deployments after the Thanksgiving holiday.
For Gordon Brown, this cannot come too soon. After the United States, Britain is the largest contributor of troops to the
Nato operation in Afghanistan. There has never been any suggestion that Britain has enough soldiers to pursue a
separate strategy or that it can operate independently of the US forces, which already number some 68,000 troops.
Until the White House decides whether to send an extra 40,000 or some figure significantly lower than the number
requested by General Stanley McChrystal, Mr Brown cannot properly plan the best support strategy.
It is becoming sadly apparent that Britain has been left drifting by the delays in Washington, and that the Obama
Administration is largely unaware of the embarrassment this is causing the Government. More worryingly, this does not
seem to be a source of concern within the Administration. Downing Street, diplomatically, turns aside any suggestion
that it is frustrated by the nonchalance with which it is being treated. But the insistent questions on Afghanistan, the
anger caused by the steady stream of returning war dead and the rapid crumbling of public support for the war cannot
be answered effectively until Mr Brown is taken into American confidence and seen as a full partner in the Nato
campaign.
On the surface, the continuing high regard in Britain for the dynamic and articulate new President has masked these
growling complaints. Mr Brown is not suffering, as his predecessor did, from the taint of close association with a deeply
unpopular US president. On the contrary: like several European leaders, he is still eager to position himself as close as
possible to Mr Obama to clothe himself in some of the President's European popularity. But within Government, there is
already worry that Britain's voice counts far less than it did in the past. This is not simply another instance of the
persistent but pointless British anxiety over the so-called special relationship; it is a justified concern that two of the
main pillars of the Nato alliance should have policies and strategies that are closely co-ordinated and sympathetically
understood on both sides when fighting a war.
The fault, glaringly, is on the American side. The White House no longer seems to be monitoring the reactions and
•political options of its transatlantic allies. It is not sufficient to suggest that the Administration sees little point in
investing time and diplomacy in a British government likely to be defeated in the coming general election; wartime allies
have interests that go far beyond the political make-up of the government of the day. Mr Obama promised during his

election campaign to revive trust in American leadership and to re-engage in multinational diplomacy. In office, he has
certainly voiced the same ideals; but he has invested little in giving new substance and dynamism to the transatlantic
relationship.
On Afghanistan, Mr Brown has sometimes been left speechless by Washington. He talks of sending 500 extra troops. But
until he knows the likely US strategy, he cannot outline his own. Atlanticism is always fragile on the Left and was
stretched to breaking point by Tony Blair. It is now being undermined by indifference in Washington. Today America is
enjoying Thanksgiving. Tomorrow it must look out again to its all
THE SPECTATOR
A special form of disrespect
Con Coughlin <http://www.spectatoncO.uk/searchlauthorfisearchString=Con%20Coughlin>
Wednesday, 18th November 2009
Barack Obama's increasing disregard for Britain's views is no way to treat an ally whose troops have fought side by
side with America since September 11, says Con Coughlin
Washington
It says much about Britain's rapidly disappearing 'special relationship' with America that when I happened to
mention to some of our senior military officers that I was visiting Washington, they begged me to find out what the
Obama administration was thinking about Afghanistan. It is not just that the transatlantic lines of communication, so
strong just a few years ago, have fallen into disuse. There is now a feeling that, even if we reached the Oval Office, there
would be no one willing to take Britain's call.
• For weeks now, President Obama has been deliberating over what the Afghan strategy should be — and how many
troops to send. If there is confusion in Washington, then Britain's strategy is not much clearer. Gordon Brown has staged
a recent flurry of activity on the subject, from writing misspelt letters to grieving mothers to demanding that an exit
strategy be established for the withdrawal of British forces. Yet among our top brass, the general perception is that the
Prime Minister has little interest in the war.
• It is often as if Brown regards the Afghan campaign as a dead fish that Tony Blair has left in the top drawer of his
Downing Street desk. It has infected his premiership with a foul odour, and he wants to be rid of it as soon as possible.
This explains his promise, on Monday, to set a timetable for the withdrawal of British troops at the earliest available
opportunity. The signal is sent that an exit is not just in sight, but being approached.
• Brown's approach hardly squares with his Foreign Secretary's assertion, made the next day in his address to Nato's
Parliamentary Assembly, that British forces should remain until the Afghans are strong enough to take care of their own
affairs. Miliband might have his faults, such as his obsessive enthusiasm for Europe. But he is sound on Afghanistan
where — unlike the prime minister — he has been an articulate and well-informed advocate of the Nato cause. One has
the feeling that, if Mr Obama were able to talk about Afghanistan, Mr Miliband could have a decent conversation with
him.
But the very fact that these policy divisions are now starting to appear in London is symptomatic of a far deeper
malaise that lies at the heart of Afghan policy-making; it is a malaise that now threatens to jeopardise the success of the
entire mission. And this malaise is the absence of meaningful dialogue between the White House and its hitherto most
stalwart and reliable ally, particularly when it comes to the messy business of confronting Islamist militants through
force of arms.
• We all had a good giggle when Brown was reduced to chasing the Leader of the Free World through the
subterranean kitchen complex at the UN's New York headquarters in September. One can understand why Obama can
think of a million better ways to spend his time than talking to our obsessive, nail-chewing and electorally doomed
prime minister. But given that Britain and America are currently fighting a war together; one would hope that the true
statesman would overcome any personal reservations and deal with Mr Brown because of the country he represents.
What really troubles British policymakers is that the collapse in the relationship is institutional, not personal, and
that the president has little interest in listening to what Britain has to say on many world issues, even at a time when
British servicemen and women are sacrificing their lives in what is supposed to be a common cause.
• The astonishing disregard with which Mr Obama treats Britain has been made clear by his deliberations over the
Afghan issue. As he decides how many more troops to send to Afghanistan — a decision which will fundamentally affect
the scope of the mission — Britain is reduced to guesswork. The White House does not even pretend to portray this as a
joint decision. It is a diplomatic cold-shouldering that stands in contrast not just to the Blair–Bush era, but to the
togetherness of the soldiers on the ground.

One of the enduring cornerstones of the transatlantic alliance is the deep bond that exists between the British and
American armed forces. The strength of the American military might be many times that available to Britain but, as any
senior officer will tell you, on either side of the Atlantic, they are so close as to be joined at the hip. From the moment
they sign up, young American and British officers train together, socialise together and — since 9/11 — have fought and
died together.
• The relaxed familiarity between the two martial traditions was reflected in the warmth with which General Stanley
McChrystal, the American commander of Nato forces in Afghanistan, referred during his recent visit to London to British
contemporaries such as `Jatko', General Sir Michael Jackson, former head of the British army, and lamby', Lt-Gen Sir
Graeme Lamb, who is currently spending his well-earned retirement in Kabul helping to devise a new counter-
insurgency strategy to defeat the Taleban. So far as Afghanistan is concerned, it would be fair to say that American and
British military commanders are singing from the same Afghan prayer mat.
• Indeed, there was no shortage of enthusiasm on the part of the British military, or any of the other Whitehall
departments involved in the Afghan campaign, to support Obama when he announced last March a new counter-
insurgency strategy based on an Iraq-like military 'surge'. McChrystal was personally appointed by Obama to make the
policy a success, and General Sir David Richards, himself a former commander of Nato forces in Afghanistan, was one of
a number of senior army officers who quickly got behind the new initiative. So, too, did the redoubtable Sir Sherard
Cowper-Coles, our former ambassador to Kabul, who drafted numerous briefing documents making the case for greater
co-operation and cohesion within Whitehall, and the development of a comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy that
encompassed all the participants, and not just the military.
So where are they now, all these bright initiatives? Why is it that the Foreign.Office and our senior military
commanders are as much in the dark as anyone else as to what the strategy for Afghanistan is to be? We don't know,
because Mr Obama is too busy cosying up to his new churns in Moscow and Beijing to tell us. And as we stumble around
in the policy darkness, there is the inevitable tendency to make it up as we go along. Hence the conflicting policy edicts
issued this week by Messrs Brown and Miliband.
• The trouble started in the summer, when Obama appears to have had a change of heart and, rather than
proceeding with the Afghan strategy he announced in March, decided to undertake a review of it instead. And in the
process of so doing he has provided us with a telling insight into how we can expect the Obama presidency to function in
future.
Much of the criticism, at home and abroad, concerning the Afghan policy review has tended to focus on
accusations of White House dithering which, after nearly three and a half months, is not entirely without foundation.
But what should be far more worrying for all those countries, such as Britain, that had looked forward to co-operating
with Obama's apparent desire to reach out and engage with America's allies is the exclusivity of his style of decision-
making — if you can call it that.
As General McChrystal has found to his cost, Obama and his inner circle of Chicago pols do not take kindly to being
second-guessed by those whose advice they seek, but have every right to reject. There is no reason to doubt
McChrystal's gloomy prediction — which is generally endorsed by Whitehall — that without an extra 40,000 Nato troops
the Afghan mission is doomed to failure. But talk to any Obama aide these days and they will tell you that, fine soldier
though he undoubtedly is, McChrystal is politically naive, spoke out of turn and now thoroughly regrets the day he ever
set foot in a London think tank, where he stated his case too explicitly for the White House's liking. One recent two-hour
Afghan strategy meeting spent 24 minutes discussing whether McChrystal was the right man for the job after all. In
other words, to use the phrase- °logy popular in Chicago, he's dead meat.
• Obama, meanwhile, has made his own deliberations so secretive that only about three people in the whole of
Washington — and, ergo, the rest of the world — know precisely what he has in mind, and none of them is talking. Even
President George \N. Bush, who was frequently criticised for his arrogance and unilateralism, was better than this. From
9/11 until the Iraq war, he kept Tony Blair and other trusted allies (there weren't that many, let's face it) fully briefed on
what he was planning — so much so that Blair is now accused of colluding with him to invade Iraq from the spring of
2002.
• But with Obama there are no regular video-conferences bringing Downing Street up to date on the latest White
House thinking. No special envoys making secret visits to London to keep the key players informed. Instead we will have
to wait, like everyone else, for the puffs of smoke from the White House — which are now expected around the
Thanksgiving holiday — to find out what Obama really intends to do about Afghanistan. He is, in all too many ways, an
AWOL ally.

Nor is it just on Afghanistan that we can discern a high-handed approach from the American president. Did Obama
bother to consult Britain before cancelling the missile shield system for Eastern Europe (the early-warning detection
system is, after all, based at RAF Fylingdales on the North Yorkshire Moors)? No he did not. The Poles, who are rightly
sensitive about their security being used as a bargaining chip in negotiations with their super-power neighbours, had to
make do with a late-night call from Hillary Clinton on the eve of the announcement — the Poles understandably turned
down the call, a breach of both manners and protocol. In his keenness to befriend Russian President Dmitry Medvedev,
had Obama taken any account of the widespread European unease concerning the mood of resurgent nationalism
sweeping Moscow? Not a chance.
• And to judge from his recent peregrinations around the Far East, it seems Obama is far more interested in making
new friends than taking the trouble to keep up with old acquaintances. The enthusiasm he displayed when he bumped
into Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's Prime Minister, during this week's Apec summit in Singapore was considerably greater
than he has shown for many of his European allies. Not for Medvedev the indignity of conducting important bilateral
discussions in kitchens surrounded by vats of boiling noodles. And in Beijing Obama spent a convivial evening with
President Hu Jintao, discussing the evolution and histories of China and America. Being an American ally has never
seemed so unrewarding.
• There will, though, inevitably come a time when Obama discovers who America's true friends really are. Sooner or
later he will have to deal with the considerably more taxing issues of Islamist militancy, rogue nuclear states and other
tangible threats to the West's security. At that point, Obama will discover a simple but essential truth. The world divides
between those who support American values of freedom and democracy, and those who seek to destroy them.
• Few nations have been more committed to supporting those values with both blood and treasure than Britain. This
country, and especially those British troops fighting alongside their American counterparts, deserve far better than this
president's disregard.

Iraq war build-up 'left us scrabbling for smoking gun says ex-UK ambassador
Sir Christopher Meyer says plans to invade Iraq did not give time for weapons inspectors
James Meikle <http://www.guardian.co.uk/profileljamesmeikle> and Andrew Sparrow
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/andrewsparrow>
• guardian.co.uk <http://www.guardian.co.uk/> , Thursday 26 November 2009 12.57 GMT
The military timetable for an invasion of Iraq <http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq> in 2003 did not give time for UN
weapons inspectors in the country to do their job, the former British ambassador to Washington told the Iraq inquiry in
London today.
Sir Christopher Meyer said the "unforgiving nature" of the build-up after American forces had been told to prepare for
war meant that "we found ourselves scrabbling for the smoking gun".
He added: "It was another way of saying 'it's not that Saddam has to prove that he's innocent, we've now bloody well
got to try and prove he's guilty.' And we – the Americans, the British – have never really recovered from that because of
course there was no smoking gun."
The US had first prepared for invasion in January but the date was later moved to March. "Ail that said, when you looked
at the timetable for the inspections, it was impossible to see how [Hans] Biix [chief weapons inspector] could bring the
process to a conclusion, for better or for worse, by March."
Meyer said he had been in favour of removing Saddam. He thought you did not need 9/11 or weapons of mass
destruction to justify confronting Iraq. Saddam had not lived up to the commitments given after the first Gulf war. He
had "the means and the will" to build weapons even if he hid not have them at the time.
Meyer said he did not know what made the UK fix "on a very large land force by our standards". He believed it would
not have damaged Britain's standing in the US to have sent fewer troops to Iraq, but actively opposing the war would
have done.

Earlier Meyer said George Bush's administration was seen by many as "running out of steam" on the eve of the "great
atrocity" of the 9/11 attacks on the US.
It looked like an administration that had run into trouble very quickly, the former ambassador to Washington said.
People were saying the effort of getting big tax cuts and medical prescription benefits for older people through Congress
had "killed" Bush, Meyer said. He added that secretary of state Colin Powell's efforts to narrow and deepen sanctions
against Iraq had failed and there was a "huge bear market" against Donald Rumsfeld, the defence secretary.
Meyer said attitudes towards Iraq were influenced to an extent not appreciated by him at the time by the anthrax scare
in the US soon after 9/11 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20O1_anthrax_attacks>. US senators and others were sent
anthrax spores in the post, a crime that led to the death of five people, prompting policymakers to claim links to Saddam
Hussein.
Meyer told the third day of Sir John Chilcot's hearings that from the onset of the Bush presidency in 2001, there was
enthusiasm on the Republican right for arming and supporting Iraqi dissidents, "mostly in London", particularly the Iraqi
National Congress led by Ahmad Chalabi.
Powell was sceptical of such "belligerent" moves, concentrating on sanctions with Robin Cook, the then-British foreign
secretary, with whom, Meyer said, "somewhat to my surprise", he got on well.
On 9/11 Condoleezza Rice, then the US national security adviser, told Meyer she was in "no doubt: it was an al-Qaida
operation". The following weekend Bush and his key advisers met at Camp David and contacts later told Meyer there
had been a "big ding-dong" about Iraq and Saddam.
It seemed that Paul Wolfowitz, Rumsfeld's deputy, argued for retaliation to include Iraq, Meyer said. It was not clear
where Rumsfeld stood. But later that month Bush and Tony Blair, on a visit to Washington, were agreed on a "laser-like
focus" on al-Qaida and Pakistan.
Blair's reputation had soared "above all others" because of his support for the US, the former ambassador told the
inquiry.
But the anthrax scare had "steamed up" policy makers in Bush's administration and helped swing attitudes against
Saddam, who the administration believed had been the last person to use anthrax.
Rice fell more and more "in the camp of Powell's enemies". There was a "sea change" in attitudes to containment but
the UK still had "a legal problem" with regime change. Meyer told British officials to argue that the alliance would be in
better shape if there was international support for military action. There was no need to argue that with the state
department. But there was with Dick Cheney, the vice-president, and Rumsfeld.
Asked about Blair's meeting with Bush at Crawford, Texas, in April 2002, where, some observers believe, the decision to
go to war was made, Meyer said: "To this day I'm not entirely clear what degree of convergence was signed in blood at
the Texas range."
But a speech by Blair the following day was, he believed, the first time the prime minister had publicaly said "regime
change". "What he was trying to do was to draw the lessons of 9/11 and apply them to the situation in Iraq, which led —!
think not inadvertently but deliberately — to a conflation of the threat posed by Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein.
"When I heard that speech, I thought that this represents a tightening of the UK/US alliance and a degree of
convergence on the danger Saddam Hussein presented."

Dear Phil, Jim and Richard,
First, Happy Thanksgiving! I am making FM calls re Afghanistan which are going well and the memcons will describe the
specific responses for our followup, especially in Athens and Brussels.
Below is a memo from a concerned observer about the British feeling alienated from us.
/Let me know what you each think. Thx.
Consensus across the board in Britain—center, right, left—is that the Atlantic alliance—the special relationship—the
historic bond since World War II—is shattered. There is no dissenting voice, not one, and there are no illusions. Opinion

British media but also has appeared as a voluble witness before the Chi!cot commission. All British newspapers and
journals have prominently published many pieces within the last week on the decline and fall of the US-UK relationship.
Please see the lead editorial today from the London Times and the cover story from the Spectator—two of the most
resolutely pro-American sources. The tone is not resentful, but reserved, disdainful and superior. The US administration
is considered blinkered, parochial and counter-productive.
Conservatives are more contemptuous than Labour, which feels abandoned and somewhat baffled. Rather than eager
to be Obama's poodle, Cameron would be superficially friendly and privately scornful. Class has a lot to do with the
contempt. A Cameron government would be more aristocratic and even narrowly Etonian than any Conservative
government in recent history, sharply contrasting especially with the striving and classless perspective of the grocer's
daughter, Margaret Thatcher.
And yet, the most recent poll this week showed Labour within striking distance of the Tories, about five points down,
the result of a slight economic uptick. A hung parliament seems very possible. Given the distribution of voting patterns,
Labour need not win a plurality to have more seats than the Tories.

The slight buoyancy for Labour in this unique situation has only heightened anxiety about Obama's Afghanistan
process, which has excluded the British government from significant consultation and consideration of its interests. See
the lead to Con Coughlin's Spectator piece.
Therefore, the President might contemplate a brief stop in London going to or coming from Oslo or a meeting in
Copenhage to make a public appearance with Brown. And, others in the Administration should pay special attention to
Brown to secure strong support from him, and more importantly, the whole government and British establishment
should be reassured that we do value their stalwart support despite the ups and downs of the last eight years.
Pasted below is the Times editorial and the link to the Spectator article.
From The Times
November 26, 2009
Atlantic drift
Washington's delay in announcing its Afghanistan strategy has left Brown drifting. Obama needs to invest more time and
attention in the transatlantic alliance President Obama declared on Tuesday that "the whole world" had a responsibility
to help the US-led mission in Afghanistan. He would, he said; soon lay out the "obligations of our international partners".
Those partners have been waiting a long time for the details. On Monday the President had his tenth meeting with his
advisers to work out his strategy for Afghanistan. He has now spent almost three months considering his options, and
has promised an announcement on deployments after the Thanksgiving holiday.
For Gordon Brown, this cannot come too soon. After the United States, Britain is the largest contributor of troops to the
Nato operation in Afghanistan. There has never been any suggestion that Britain has enough soldiers to pursue a
separate strategy or that it can operate independently of the US forces, which already number some 68,000 troops.
Until the White House decides whether to send an extra 40,000 or some figure significantly lower than the number
requested by General Stanley McChrystal, Mr Brown cannot properly plan the best support strategy.
It is becoming sadly apparent that Britain has been left drifting by the delays in Washington, and that the Obama
Administration is largely unaware of the embarrassment this is causing the Government. More worryingly, this does not
seem to be a source of concern within the Administration. Downing Street, diplomatically, turns aside any suggestion
that it is frustrated by the nonchalance with which it is being treated. But the insistent questions on Afghanistan, the
anger caused by the steady stream of returning war dead and the rapid crumbling of public support for the war cannot
be answered effectively until Mr Brown is taken into American confidence and seen as a full partner in the Nato
campaign.
On the surface, the continuing high regard in Britain for the dynamic and articulate new President has masked these
growling complaints. Mr Brown is not suffering, as his predecessor did, from the taint of close association with a deeply
unpopular US president. On the contrary: like several European leaders, he is still eager to position himself as close as
possible to Mr Obama to clothe himself in some of the President's European popularity. But within Government, there is
already worry that Britain's voice counts far less than it did in the past. This is not simply another instance of the
persistent but pointless British anxiety over the so-called special relationship; it is a justified concern that two of the
main pillars of the Nato alliance should have policies and strategies that are closely co-ordinated and sympathetically
understood on both sides when fighting a war.
The fault, glaringly, is on the American side. The White House no longer seems to be monitoring the reactions and
political options of its transatlantic allies. It is not sufficient to suggest that the Administration sees little point in
investing time and diplomacy in a British government likely to be defeated in the coming general election; wartime allies
have interests that go far beyond the political make-up of the government of the day. Mr Obama promised during his
election campaign to revive trust in American leadership and to re-engage in multinational diplomacy. In office, he has
certainly voiced the same ideals; but he has invested little in giving new substance and dynamism to the transatlantic
relationship.
On Afghanistan, Mr Brown has sometimes been left speechless by Washington. He talks of sending 500 extra troops. But
until he knows the likely US strategy, he cannot outline his own. Atlanticism is always fragile on the Left and was
stretched to breaking point by Tony Blair. It is now being undermined by indifference in Washington. Today America is
enjoying Thanksgiving. Tomorrow it must look out again to its all

Statement by the Secretary
On the Restoration of Democratic and Constitutional Order In Honduras November 27, 2009
The United States remains committed to help restore the democratic and constitutional order in Honduras in the wake
of the June 28 coup d'etat that removed President Zelaya and led to the suspension of Honduras from the Organization
of American States. As part of that effort, it is essential for both parties in Honduras to implement the measures they
agreed to in the Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord, including the formation of a government of unity and national
reconciliation and the December 2 congressional vote on President Zelaya"s restitution. These are vital elements of the
Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord, and the Honduran people and the international community expect an expeditious
determination. We look forward to the Congressional deliberations getting underway as announced.
The November 29 national elections are another critical step in the restoration of the democratic and constitutional
order in Honduras. The electoral process -- launched well before June 28 and involving legitimate candidates
representing parties with longstanding democratic traditions from a broad ideological spectrum -- is conducted under
the stewardship of the non-partisan Supreme Electoral Tribunal, which was also selected before the coup. The electoral
renewal of presidential, congressional and mayoral mandates, enshrined in the Honduran constitution, is an inalienable
expression of the sovereign will of the citizens of Honduras. We wish the Honduran people well as they choose their
new leaders on Sunday, and we urge all sides to exercise their rights peacefully.
The holding of a free, fair and transparent election is necessary but not sufficient for Honduras to reestablish the
democratic and constitutional order. In order to help achieve that objective, we will continue, along with others in the
region, to support the step-by-step implementation of the Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord as a democratic way forward for
the Honduran people. The president-elect who emerges from an election deemed free and fair will have a unique
opportunity to promote that vital mission.

Millennium Challenge Report
The Millennium Challenge Act of 2003 requires the submission of a report to Congress and publication in the Federal
Register of a list of countries that are candidate countries for MCC assistance, and countries that would be candidate
countries but for "specified legal prohibitions on assistance." Honduras is a candidate country. If Honduras is subject to
the restrictions in section 7008, it would be listed in that section of the report that identifies countries that would be
candidate countries but for legal prohibitions that prohibit assistance. The report would also provide an explanation of
the legal prohibition (in fact, other coup restricted countries, such as Cote d'Ivoire, Madagascar, Mauritania, and Sudan,
are on the prohibited list and section 7008 is explicitly mentioned).
The list must be approved by the Board of the MCC, of which the Secretary is the chair, and is due on 9/10. It is our
understanding that an action memo will be presented to the Secretary, perhaps as early as next week, so that she can
approve submission of the report. The action memo will require the Secretary to decide whether Honduras is a country
without a "specified legal prohibition" or whether such a prohibition has in fact attached

Dear Madame Secretary,
I am following up on the letter I sent to you on November 8, 2009 at the suggestion of Melanne Verveer.
On March 12th and 13th, in New York City, 300 influential women from diverse countries and cultures will come
together to illuminate the circumstances of their lives and to explore the still unfulfilled promise of women around the
world. "Women in the World: Stories and Solutions," will be hosted by The Daily Beast, the United Nations Foundation,
Vital Voices Global Partnership, and Diane von Furstenberg (and sponsored by Hewlett Packard who will bring their most
creative digital support).
We are delighted to announce that for our opening night on Friday, March 12, at the Hudson Theatre in Manhattan, we
have an extraordinary event planned. The legendary Broadway director Julie Taymor has agreed to direct the Vital
Voices play Seven, featuring acclaimed film and stage actresses. At the conclusion of this performance, we will host a
panel conversation featuring their real-life counterparts: Hafsat Abiola, Farida Azizi, Anabella De Leon, Inez McCormack,
Mukhtar Mai, Mu Sochua, and Marina Pisklakova-Parker.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760483 Date: 06/30/2015
Madame Secretary, we would very much like to dedicate this performance to your lifelong efforts on behalf of women
around the world. Melanne tells me that you have not seen the play, and there is no doubt that with the caliber of
actresses that Taymor has in mind, this will be its most sensational performance ever. If there was also any chance that
you would be able to moderate a panel afterwards that set the agenda for our weekend's discussions, it would be a
superbly valuable call to arms for an audience of influential decision makers, international media, and committed
philanthropists.
The Women in the World weekend will showcase vivid, powerful, and deeply personal testimony through first-person
storytelling, films, performances, exhibits, and interviews. The goal is not only to make these issues vivid, but to provide
a concrete outcome at the end, through projects we will sponsor and through commitments we have won from the
influential women who are present. Some of the topics will
be: Women in Afghanistan and Pakistan, Rape as a Tool of War, Women as Peacemakers, and Girl Up - The United
Nations Foundation's Campaign to Keep Teenage Girls in School.
Expected participants to date are: Her Majesty Queen Rania of Jordan, Ambassador Luis CdeBaca, Under Secretary of
State for Democracy and Global Affairs Maria Otero, Washington D.C. Schools Chancellor Michelle Rhee, Actress Cate
Blanchett, Tostan Founder Molly Melching, Women for Women International President Zainab Salbi, Hewlett-Packard
Executive Vice President Ann Livemore, former Senior Adviser for Women's Empowerment Shirin Tahir-Kheli, CNN's
Christiane Amanpour, former Homeland Security Advisor Frances Townsend, Actress Helen Mirren, Bank of America
President of Global Wealth & Investment Management Sallie Krawcheck, India's first and highest-ranking woman officer
Kiran Bedi, Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues Melanne Verveer, Co-Chairman of Sony Pictures Amy Pascal
and many more.
Madame Secretary, we do hope that you'll be able to find the time in your incredibly busy schedule to attend this New
York highlight of International Women's Month. I would be happy to talk to the appropriate member of your staff to
provide further details that might help make your decision.
Best regards,
Tina Brown

There are a number of different possibilities for how the decision on the Guinea/Madagascar credentials may go
tomorrow. (It is Zambia and Tanzania bringing the challenge on behalf of the AU.) I was under the impression that we
would not have to vote on the potential credentials challenges. We may have to.
We may have to vote on a motion to *deny* them credentials and exclude them. For the moment, the guidance is to
vote to credential all countries — including these two — as is customary, while conducting outreach with Tanzania,
Zambia, and the AU to explain that we have our own imperatives but we support the fact that they are taking a
principled stand.
We may have to vote on a motion to *defer* decision, which would allow them to be seated and vote but would not
formally grant credentials. For the moment, the guidance is to potentially support such a motion — this was the practice
with respect to South Africa between 1983 and 1994. Everyone is in the same place on this.
Ultimately, however, the whole thing may die of its own weight. This is probably the most likely outcome.

Subject: (Nytimes) U.S. Accuses Pakistan of Altering Missiles
WASHINGTON — The United States has accused Pakistan of illegally modifying American-made missiles to expand its
capability to strike land targets, a potential threat to India, according to senior administration and Congressional
officials.
The charge, which set off a new outbreak of tensions between the United States and Pakistan, was made in an
unpublicized diplomatic protest in late June to Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani and other top Pakistani officials.
The accusation comes at a particularly delicate time, when the administration is asking Congress to approve $7.5 billion
in aid to Pakistan over the next five years, and when Washington is pressing a reluctant Pakistani military to focus its
attentions on fighting the Taliban, rather than expanding its nuclear and conventional forces aimed at India.
While American officials say that the weapon in the latest dispute is a conventional one — based on the Harpoon
antiship missiles that were sold to Pakistan by the Reagan administration as a defensive weapon in the cold war — the
subtext of the argument is growing concern about the speed with which Pakistan is developing new generations of both
conventional and nuclear weapons.
"There's a concerted effort to get these guys to slow down," one senior administration official said. "Their energies are
misdirected."
At issue is the detection by American intelligence agencies of a suspicious missile test on April 23 — a test never
announced by the Pakistanis — that appeared to give the country a new offensive weapon.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760490 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760490 Date: 06/30/2015
American military and intelligence officials say they suspect that Pakistan has modified the Harpoon antiship missiles
that the United States sold the country in the 1980s, a move that would be a violation of the Arms Control Export Act.
Pakistan has denied the charge, saying it developed the missile itself. The United States has also accused Pakistan of
modifying American-made P-3C aircraft for land-attack missions, another violation of United States law that the Obama
administration has protested.
Whatever their origin, the missiles would be a significant new entry into Pakistan's arsenal against India. They would
enable Pakistan's small navy to strike targets on land, complementing the sizable land-based missile arsenal that
Pakistan has developed. That, in turn, would be likely to spur another round of an arms race with India that the United
States has been trying, unsuccessfully, to halt. "The focus of our concern is that this is a potential unauthorized
modification of a maritime antiship defensive capability to an offensive land-attack missile," said another senior
administration official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity because the matter involves classified
information.
"The potential for proliferation and end-use violations are things we watch very closely," the official added. "When we
have concerns, we act aggressively."
A senior Pakistani official, also speaking on the condition of anonymity because the interchanges with Washington have
been both delicate and highly classified, said the American accusation was "incorrect." The official said that the missile
tested was developed by Pakistan, just as it had modified North Korean designs to build a range of land-based missiles
that could strike India. He said that Pakistan had taken the unusual step of agreeing to allow American officials to inspect
the country's Harpoon inventory to prove that it had not violated the law, a step that administration officials praised.
Some experts are also skeptical of the American claims. Robert Hewson, editor of Jane's Air Launched Weapons, a
yearbook and Web-based data service, said the Harpoon missile did not have the necessary range for a land-attack
missile, which would lend credibility to Pakistani claims that they are developing their own new missile. Moreover, he
said, Pakistan already has more modern land-attack missiles that it developed itself or acquired from China.
"They're beyond the need to reverse-engineer old U.S. kit," Mr. Hewson said in a telephone interview. "They're more
sophisticated than that." Mr. Hewson said the ship-to-shore missile that Pakistan was testing was part of a concerted
effort to develop an array of conventional missiles that could be fired from the air, land or sea to address India's much
more formidable conventional missile arsenal.
The dispute highlights the level of mistrust that remains between the United States and a Pakistani military that
American officials like to portray as an increasingly reliable partner in the effort to root out the forces of the Taliban and
Al Qaeda on Pakistani territory. A central element of the American effort has been to get the military refocused on the
internal threat facing the country, rather than on threat the country believes it still faces from India.
Pakistani officials have insisted that they are making that shift. But the evidence continues to point to heavy investments
in both nuclear and conventional weapons that experts say have no utility in the battle against insurgents.
Over the years, the United States has provided a total of 165 Harpoon missiles to Pakistan, including 37 of the older-
model weapons that were delivered from 1985 to 1988, said Charles Taylor, a spokesman for the Defense Security
Cooperation Agency.
The country's nuclear arsenal is expanding faster than any other nation's. In May, Pakistan conducted a test firing of its
Babur medium-range cruise missile, a weapon that military experts say could potentially be tipped with a nuclear
warhead. The test was conducted on May 6, during a visit to Washington by President Asif All Zardari, but was not made
public by Pakistani officials until three days after the meetings had ended to avoid upsetting the talks. While it may be
technically possible to arm the Harpoons with small nuclear weapons, outside experts say it would probably not be
necessary.

Before Congress departed for its summer recess, administration officials briefed crucial legislators on the protest to
Pakistan. The dispute has the potential to delay or possibly even derail the legislation to provide Pakistan with $7.5
billion in civilian aid over five years; lawmakers are scheduled to vote on the aid package when they return from their
recess next month.
The legislation is sponsored by Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts and Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, the top Democrat
and Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, as well as Representative Howard L. Berman, a California Democrat
who leads the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Congressional aides are now reconciling House and Senate versions of
the legislation.
Frederick Jones, a spokesman for Mr. Kerry, declined to comment on the details of the dispute citing its classified nature
but suggested that the pending multifaceted aid bill would clear Congress "in a few weeks" and would help cooperation
between the two countries.
"There have been irritants in the U.S.-Pakistan relationship in the past and there will be in the future," Mr. Jones said in
a statement, noting that the pending legislation would provide President Obama "with new tools to address troubling
behavior."

Re: Backdrop to your coming week
Below is a piece published today in The Observer, the Sunday newspaper of The Guardian, on the Chilcot inquiry,
summarizing the testimony so far and what is expected this week while you are drumming up support for the
Afghanistan initiative. Britain and Europe are riveted by Chilcot, especially official circles. The objective correlative, of
course, is trust in any U.S. administration and deep skepticism about the Afghanistan project. Yet another undercurrent
among the mandarins is disdainful resentment of indifference to Britain, a sentiment beyond Labour or the Tories but
what has emerged as the view of the permanent establishment at Whitehall and elsewhere.
Mandelson Watch: After Miliband declined to reach for the EU foreign secretaryship (though Sarkozy wanted him to
take it and Brown was not averse, even favorable), Mandelson personally campaigned on his own for it among the
Europeans. Mandelson was eager to Miliband to take the EU post, allowing Mandelson to be appointed foreign
minister. When Miliband refused, Mandelson's ambition was thwarted, and tried to seize the EU position for himself,
but without any backing in Europe or from Gordon. The Europeans thought him mad. Suddenly, they recalled his bad or
strange behavior as UK commissioner to the EU. When Christine Ashton was named, Mandelson briefed the press on her
lack of credentials, etc. Ashton, as it happens, had worked the press to try to help Mandelson when he had gotten into
the mess that led to his first resignation. Those inside the government who remember this see it as an illustration of the
principle that no good deed goes unpunished. Mandelson, in a snit, is now not speaking to Gordon as though his
rejection were Gordon's fault.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/nov/29/iraq-war-inquiry-chilcot-blair
Chilcot Inquiry: Mandarins take revenge on Tony Blair over Iraq Civil servants and diplomats are lining up to stick a knife
into former PM's reputation
* Toby Helm <http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tobyhelm> and Rajeev Syal
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/rajeev-syal>
* The Observer <http://observer.guardian.co.uk>, Sunday 29 November 2009
* Whitehall mandarins are supreme masters of subtle evasion. But they do not rise to the top of their trade without
also knowing how to stick in the knife.
At times the Chilcot inquiry into Britain's involvement in Iraq since 2001, which opened last week, resembled a
gentlemen's club moved to the sanitised surroundings of the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in Westminster.
Oxbridge-educated pillars of the establishment politely questioned other Oxbridge-educated pillars of the establishment
about who said what to whom in which memo. The inquiry is a peculiar mixture of the old and the new, the open and
closed. It is conducted in the language of Whitehall, yet beamed live by webcam to the world.
Critics are convinced that, for all Sir John Chilcot's promises to the contrary, it will turn out to be another Whitehall
whitewash. For the cognoscenti, little new information has yet emerged, and when the final report is written it will not
seek to apportion blame. Yet beneath the equivocation and mandarin-speak, Whitehall seems, in as much as it knows
how, to be using Chilcot to wield the scalpel. Throughout the first week the pent-up frustrations of diplomats and career
civil servants over the way Tony Blair <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/tonyblair> and George Bush secretly plotted
to oust Saddam Hussein, bypassing the "official channels" in which they operate, has been there for all to see.
Chilcot is said to have been warned by his Whitehall friends that many witnesses will be ready to unburden themselves —
finally to take revenge. In session after session they have appeared to do that. Blair's reputation has been sliced like
salami day after day.
Sir William Ehrman, the Foreign Office's former director of international security, volunteered last Wednesday that the
threat from Saddam's,supposed weapons of mass destruction was known to be limited.
In the gentlest way he drove in the dagger. "We did, I think on 10 March [2003], get a report that chemical weapons
might have remained disassembled and Saddam hadn't yet ordered their assembly. There was a suggestion that Iraq
might lack warheads capable of effective dispersal of agents."
Ever the diplomat, however, Ehrman went on to say that the intelligence warnings had not made any difference to the
case for war. "I don't think it invalidated the point about the programmes he had. It was more about use," he said. But
he had set the tone.
On Thursday, Sir Christopher Meyer, UK ambassador in Washington from 1997 to 2003, who has already criticised the
government over Iraq in his memoirs, went for Blair, mercilessly comparing his qualities as a war leader to those of
Margaret Thatcher. "I'm not trying to make a party political point here whatsoever, but quite often I. think about this:
what would Margaret Thatcher have done?" Meyer asked. "I think she would have insisted on a coherent political and
diplomatic strategy and she would have demanded the greatest clarity about what the heck happened if, and when, you
removed Saddam Hussein."
A former press secretary to John Major who can speak like a mandarin but, equally, can talk like a layman, he said Blair
had failed miserably to extract a price from George Bush for his loyalty. "We could have achieved more by playing a
tougher role... if, for example... Tony Blair had said: 'I want to help you, George, on this, but I have to say, in all honesty,
that I will not be able to take part in any military operation unless we have palpable progress on the [Middle East] peace
process and we have absolute clarity on what happens in Iraq if it comes up.' I think that would have changed the nature
— it would not have led to a rupture — it would have changed the nature of American planning."
Even when defending UK policy, he was on the offensive. Asked if policy had been adapted to stay in line with
Washington's, Meyer added: "I wouldn't say it was as extremely poodle-ish as that."

On Friday, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's former ambassador to the United Nations, told Chilcot he had threatened to
resign in 2002 if at least one security council resolution was not passed. He added: "I regard our participation in the
military action in Iraq in March 2003 as legal but of questionable legitimacy, in that it did not have the democratically
observable backing of the great majority of [UN] member states, or even perhaps of the majority of people inside the
UK."
Today new arguments are raging over whether the inquiry will have access to, and publish, the most sensitive
documents — including legal advice given to the government by the former attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, during the
lead-up to war. Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader, has written to Gordon Brown saying that, unless all such
material is published, the inquiry will be a sham and the public's sense that it has been denied the facts will remain.
But it will still be essential viewing nonetheless. This week will see more key witnesses. The most revealing testimony
could come tomorrow when Sir David Manning, Blair's former foreign policy
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/foreignpolicy> adviser, is certain to be asked about his authorship of a memo
which purportedly revealed details of a secret meeting between Bush and Blair in January 2003. According to reports,
the five pages of secret documents, known as the Manning memo, recorded the White House meeting on 31 January
which allegedly shows that Bush and Blair made a deal to carry out an invasion regardless of whether weapons of mass
destruction were discovered by UN weapons inspectors. It appears to be in direct contradiction with statements that
Blair made to parliament afterwards that Saddarn would be given a final chance to disarm.
The memo also disclosed that Bush floated the idea of painting a U-2 spyplane in UN colours and letting it fly low over
Iraq to provoke Saddam into ordering it to be shot down, providing a pretext for the subsequent invasion by America
and Britain.
Manning, educated at Oriel College, Oxford, and a career diplomat, is fiercely independent. He may choose to say more
than Blair would like, according to one former colleague. He could also be asked to either confirm or deny Meyer's
evidence that Meyer received "new instructions" in early 2005 indicating that it was a "complete waste of time" to
oppose regime change, so strong was the US determination to go down that road.
On Tuesday, Edward Chaplin, the Foreign Office Middle East director at the time of the invasion, and Sir Peter Ricketts,
the top official in the Foreign Office, will appear. Ricketts, a former chairman of Britain's powerful joint intelligence
committee, has already given evidence to the inquiry alleging that officials in London knew even before Bush came to
office in 2001 that there were "voices" in Washington calling for Saddam to be removed from power. Ricketts also told
the inquiry that, until March 2002, Whitehall distanced itself from regime change. Only one month later, Blair told Bush
that he would support military action "to bring about regime change".
According to documents leaked five years ago, Ricketts described the US in 2002 as "scrambling to establish a link
between Iraq and al-Qaida" — a connection that was "so far, frankly unconvincing". On Thursday, Sir Kevin Tebbit, the
Ministry of Defence's permanent secretary during the invasion, will be asked to give evidence about the military
planning. Chilcot will, most likely, want to know when the government first began to amass resources for the war and
what, if any, preparations were made for the aftermath of an invasion. Tebbit could also be urged to divulge the level of
intelligence he received on the likelihood of an attack with chemical or biological weapons.
After Tebbit, a succession of heavy-hitting military men will give evidence. The former chief of the defence staff, Admiral
the Lord Boyce, could be asked whether he believes that the invasion was legal. On Friday, Lieutenant General Sir
Anthony Pigott, former deputy chief of the defence staff, and Major General David Wilson, senior British military adviser
to the US military's central command between 2002 and 2003, will be questioned about military planning for the
conflict.
The last witness to appear this week will be Dominic Asquith, Britain's ambassador to Iraq between 2006 and 2007, who
will come armed with knowledge of the view from Baghdad.
When Chilcot has made his way through the officials, he will turn in the new year to former ministers, including Jack
Straw, the former foreign secretary, and Blair himself. The panel has said that it will also begin to examine the highly
controversial issue of whether the invasion was legal — which may turn out to be the focal point of the whole inquiry — in
January.
In his final report, which is not expected until late 2010 at the earliest, Chilcot has said he will not seek to attribute
blame. But after only one week it is already clear where much of Whitehall believes that lies.

Afghanistan: The speech you'll miss

Sunday, November 29, 2009
Dec. 1, 2009:
My fellow Americans,
This is not the speech you expected to hear. But my wordsmiths are tied in knots writing an acceptance speech for the
only Nobel Peace Prize ever awarded for making speeches. So I am going to tell you how I really feel about Afghanistan.
Which is: steamed.
1 want to accomplish three goals tonight without naming them.
First, to let those know-it-alls, Generals Petraeus and McChrystal, know one more thing: This is the last big troop
increase you get, so make it work.
! am not going down the incrementalist road that wrecked Lyndon Johnson's presidency. This is not July 1965, when
Westmoreland jumped the shark of escalation in Vietnam and then never stopped asking for more troops. For all the
trouble he has been, Dick Holbrooke helped by recalling that history in the shadowboxing that dominated my long war
council meetings.
Joe Biden has been good in there, too. He's been willing, though not happy, to be characterized in the media as being
ready to bug out now. This helped us push back against McChrystal's effort to box me in at 40,000 addrtional U.S.
soldiers.
Denis McDonough, my strategic communications man, sold Biden-as-dove brilliantly. Wasn't somebody just saying I
should promote Denis? Maybe it was Denis?
Never mind. That tactic won me room to maneuver toward a more realistic number of, say, 23,000 new combat troops,
5,000 additional trainers and a "NATO surge" of 5,000 foreign troops.
That's my second unspoken goal: to come out of this buildup speech without losing the left of the Democratic Party --
while being able to refute John McCain's charges that I ignored my own generals. Triangulation lives.
Bush put the generals in the limelight to sell the Iraq surge after he lost all credibility, and David Petraeus's performance
was dazzling. Which presents two big problems. Petraeus is the only person who could get the Republican nomination in
2012 and make a serious run against me. (I get paid to think ahead.) And if the generals box me in, civilian control of the
military in this country becomes a mockery. Clinton was afraid of the military; Bush was deep in hock to it. I've got to get
the right balance back.
That's why I need Bob Gates and Jim Jones. Those who scoffed at my keeping on Bush's defense secretary, and then
making a retired Marine four-star I hardly knew my NSC guy, were not thinking that moments like this would come. I
already was.
Gates has maneuvered flawlessly through my waterboarding-by-leaks on Afghanistan. He will sell my final number to the
uniforms as the "floor" for U.S. troops that Petraeus argues we need for three years. But Gates knows I will make it a
ceiling.
We can't afford an open-ended commitment. I put Peter Orszag, as good a budget overseer as you can find, front and
center for the photographers in that last war council. Many missed it, but NBC's Andrea Mitchell got it right away. No
wonder she's married to Alan Greenspan.
I will bet that Stan McChrystaI never drew up a budget in his life.
Jones tells me these Special Operations commanders are used to getting whatever they ask for, especially since
September 11th. Nobody on the Hill will deny them anything.
Jones is also squeezing the Europeans to join the battle and is getting results, even from the Germans. What is it Jones
says? Maybe the worst thing of all would be to be perceived to lose in Afghanistan and then have the Europeans say:
Well, you never asked for more help at the crucial time. Makes sense to me.
We have sent NATO members the numbers we think they can and should provide, country by country. That new
secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, is pulling out the stops, visiting the capitals to get commitments.
"Say it now, pay it later," we tell the Europeans. They have until mid-2010 to deploy their new units. But I need pledges
now so !can get across tonight that this is NATO's war, not Obama's war. That's unspoken-goal number three.
So I have frontloaded the speech with allusions to this being about an exit strategy, without boxing myself in on timing,
and am presenting the "civilian surge" as being as essential as the troop buildup. That helps set up my Oslo speech. And
who knows? it may even work out that way. If God blesses us all.

lead-up to war. Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader, has written to Gordon Brown saying that, unless all such
material is published, the inquiry will be a sham and the public's sense that it has been denied the facts will remain.
But it will still be essential viewing nonetheless. This week will see more key witnesses. The most revealing testimony
could come tomorrow when Sir David Manning, Blair's former foreign policy
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/foreignpolicy> adviser, is certain to be asked about his authorship of a memo
which purportedly revealed details of a secret meeting between Bush and Blair in January 2003. According to reports,
the five pages of secret documents, known as the Manning memo, recorded the White House meeting on 31 January
which allegedly shows that Bush and Blair made a deal to carry out an invasion regardless of whether weapons of mass
destruction were discovered by UN weapons inspectors. It appears to be in direct contradiction with statements that
Blair made to parliament afterwards that Saddam would be given a final chance to disarm.
The memo also disclosed that Bush floated the idea of painting a U-2 spyplane in UN colours and letting it fly low over
Iraq to provoke Saddam into ordering it to be shot down, providing a pretext for the subsequent invasion by America
and Britain.
Manning, educated at Oriel College, Oxford, and a career diplomat, is fiercely independent. He may choose to say more
than Blair would like, according to one former colleague. He could also be asked to either confirm or deny Meyer's
evidence that Meyer received "new instructions" in early 2005 indicating that it was a "complete waste of time" to
oppose regime change, so strong was the US determination to go down that road.
On Tuesday, Edward Chaplin, the Foreign Office IVIiddle East director at the time of the invasion, and Sir Peter Ricketts,
the top official in the Foreign Office, will appear. Ricketts, a former chairman of Britain's powerful joint intelligence
committee, has already given evidence to the inquiry alleging that officials in London knew even before Bush came to
office in 2001 that there were "voices" in Washington calling for Saddam to be removed from power. Ricketts also told
the inquiry that, until March 2002, Whitehall distanced itself from regime change. Only one month later, Blair told Bush
that he would support military action "to bring about regime change".
According to documents leaked five years ago, Ricketts described the US in 2002 as "scrambling to establish a link
between Iraq and al-Qaida" — a connection that was "so far, frankly unconvincing". On Thursday, Sir Kevin Tebbit, the
Ministry of Defence's permanent secretary during the invasion, will be asked to give evidence about the military
planning. Chilcot will, most likely, want to know when the government first began to amass resources for the war and
what, if any, preparations were made for the aftermath of an invasion. Tebbit could also be urged to divulge the level of
intelligence he received on the likelihood of an attack with chemical or biological weapons.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760499 Date: 06/30/2015
After Tebbit, a succession of heavy-hitting military men will give evidence. The former chief of the defence staff, Admiral
the Lord Boyce, could be asked whether he believes that the invasion was legal. On Friday, Lieutenant General Sir
Anthony Pigott, former deputy chief of the defence staff, and Major General David Wilson, senior British military adviser
to the US military's central command between 2002 and 2003, will be questioned about military planning for the
conflict.
The last witness to appear this week will be Dominic Asquith, Britain's ambassador to Iraq between 2006 and 2007, who
will come armed with knowledge of the view from Baghdad.
When Chi!cot has made his way through the officials, he will turn in the new year to former ministers, including Jack
Straw, the former foreign secretary, and Blair himself. The panel has said that it will also begin to examine the highly
controversial issue of whether the invasion was legal — which may turn out to be the focal point of the whole inquiry — in
January.
In his final report, which is not expected until late 2010 at the earliest, Chilcot has said he will not seek to attribute
blame. But after only one week it is already clear where much of Whitehall believes that lies.
The Washington Post
Afghanistan: The speech you'll miss
By Jim Hoagiand
Sunday, November 29, 2009
Dec. 1, 2009:
My fellow Americans,
This is not the speech you expected to hear. But my wordsmiths are tied in knots writing an acceptance speech for the
only Nobel Peace Prize ever awarded for making speeches. So I am going to tell you how I really feel about Afghanistan.
Which is: steamed.
I want to accomplish three goals tonight without naming them.
First, to let those know-it-ails, Generals Petraeus and McChrystal, know one more thing: This is the last big troop
increase you get, so make it work.
I am not going down the incrementalist road that wrecked Lyndon Johnson's presidency. This is not July 1965, when
Westmoreland jumped the shark of escalation in Vietnam and then never stopped asking for more troops. For all the
trouble he has been, Dick Holbrooke helped by recalling that history in the shadowboxing that dominated my long war
council meetings.
Joe Biden has been good in there, too. He's been willing, though not happy, to be characterized in the media as being
ready to bug out now. This helped us push back against McChrystal's effort to box me in at 40,000 additional U.S.
soldiers.
Denis McDonough, my strategic communications man, sold Biden-as-dove brilliantly. Wasn't somebody just saying I
should promote Denis? Maybe it was Denis?
Never mind. That tactic won me room to maneuver toward a more realistic number of, say, 23,000 new combat troops,
5,000 additional trainers and a "NATO surge" of 5,000 foreign troops.
That's my second unspoken goal: to come out of this buildup speech without losing the left of the Democratic Party --
while being able to refute John McCain's charges that I ignored my own generals. Triangulation lives.
Bush put the generals in the limelight to sell the Iraq surge after he lost all credibility, and David Petraeus's performance
was dazzling. Which presents two big problems. Petraeus is the only person who could get the Republican nomination in
2012 and make a serious run against me. (I get paid to think ahead.) And if the generals box me in, civilian control of the
military in this country becomes a mockery. Clinton was afraid of the military; Bush was deep in hock to it. I've got to get
the right balance back.
That's why I need Bob Gates and Jim Jones. Those who scoffed at my keeping on Bush's defense secretary, and then
making a retired Marine four-star I hardly knew my NSC guy, were not thinking that moments like this would come. I
already was.
Gates has maneuvered flawlessly through my waterboarding-by-leaks on Afghanistan. He will sell my final number to the
uniforms as the "floor" for U.S. troops that Petraeus argues we need for three years. But Gates knows I will make it a
ceiling.
We can't afford an open-ended commitment. I put Peter Orszag, as good a budget overseer as you can find, front and
center for the photographers in that last war council. Many missed it, but NBC's Andrea Mitchell got it right away. No
wonder she's married to Alan Greenspan.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760499 Date: 06/30/2015
I will bet that Stan McChrystal never drew up a budget in his life.
Jones tells me these Special Operations commanders are used to getting whatever they ask for, especially since
September 11th. Nobody on the Hill will deny them anything.
Jones is also squeezing the Europeans to join the battle and is getting results, even from the Germans. What is it Jones
says? Maybe the worst thing of all would be to be perceived to lose in Afghanistan and then have the Europeans say:
Well, you never asked for more help at the crucial time. Makes sense to me.
We have sent NATO members the numbers we think they can and should provide, country by country. That new
secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, is pulling out the stops, visiting the capitals to get commitments.
"Say it now, pay it later," we tell the Europeans. They have until mid-2010 to deploy their new units. But I need pledges
now so I can get across tonight that this is NATO's war, not Obama's war. That's unspoken-goal number three.
So I have frontloaded the speech with allusions to this being about an exit strategy, without boxing myself in on timing,
and am presenting the "civilian surge" as being as essential as the troop buildup. That helps set up my Oslo speech. And
who knows? It may even work out that way. If God blesses us all.

Re: Backdrop to your coming week
Below is a piece published today in The Observer, the Sunday newspaper of The Guardian, on the Chilcot inquiry,
summarizing the testimony so far and what is expected this week while you are drumming up support for the
Afghanistan initiative. Britain and Europe are riveted by Chi;cot, especially official circles. The objective correlative, of
course, is trust in any U.S. administration and deep skepticism about the Afghanistan project. Yet another undercurrent
among the mandarins is disdainful resentment of indifference to Britain, a sentiment beyond Labour or the Tories but
what has emerged as the view of the permanent establishment at Whitehall and elsewhere.
Mandelson Watch: After Miliband declined to reach for the EU foreign secretaryship (though Sarkozy wanted him to
take it and Brown was not averse, even favorable), Mandelson personally campaigned on his own for it among the
Europeans. Mandelson was eager to Miliband to take the EU post, allowing Mandelson to be appointed foreign
minister. When Miliband refused, MandeIson's ambition was thwarted, and tried to seize the EU position for himself,
but without any backing in Europe or from Gordon. The Europeans thought him mad. Suddenly, they recalled his bad or
strange behavior as UK commissioner to the EU. When Christine Ashton was named, Mandelson briefed the press on her
lack of credentials, etc. Ashton, as it happens, had worked the press to try to help Mandelson when he had gotten into
the mess that led to his first resignation. Those inside the government who remember this see it as an illustration of the
principle that no good deed goes unpunished. Mandelson, in a snit, is now not speaking to Gordon as though his
rejection were Gordon's fault.
One more item: Did you read Jim Hoagland in the Washington Post today? He nails McDonough for trashing Biden,
among other things. Enclosed below story on Chilcot:
http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/nov/29/iraq-war-inquiry-chilcot-blair
Chilcot Inquiry: Mandarins take revenge on Tony Blair over Iraq Civil servants and diplomats are lining up to stick a knife
into former PM's reputation
* Toby Helm <http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tobyhelm> and Rajeev Syal
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/rajeev-syal>
* The Observer <http://observer.guardian.co.uk>, Sunday 29 November 2009
* Whitehall mandarins are supreme masters of subtle evasion. But they do not rise to the top of their trade without
also knowing how to stick in the knife.
At times the Chilcot inquiry into Britain's involvement in Iraq since 2001, which opened last week, resembled a
gentlemen's club moved to the sanitised surroundings of the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in Westminster.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760500 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760500 Date: 06/30/2015
Oxbridge-educated pillars of the establishment politely questioned other Oxbridge-educated pillars of the establishment
about who said what to whom in which memo. The inquiry is a peculiar mixture of the old and the new, the open and
closed. It is conducted in the language of Whitehall, yet beamed live by webcam to the world.
Critics are convinced that, for all Sir John ChiIcot's promises to the contrary, it will turn out to be another Whitehall
whitewash. For the cognoscenti, little new information has yet emerged, and when the final report is written it will not
seek to apportion blame. Yet beneath the equivocation and mandarin-speak, Whitehall seems, in as much as it knows
how, to be using Chilcot to wield the scalpel. Throughout the first week the pent-up frustrations of diplomats and career
civil servants over the way Tony Blair <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/tonyblair> and George Bush secretly plotted
to oust Saddam Hussein, bypassing the "official channels" in which they operate, has been there for all to see.
Chilcot is said to have been warned by his Whitehall friends that many witnesses will be ready to unburden themselves —
finally to take revenge. In session after session they have appeared to do that. Blair's reputation has been sliced like
salami day after day.
Sir William Ehrman, the Foreign Office's former director of international security, volunteered last Wednesday that the
threat from Saddam's supposed weapons of mass destruction was known to be limited.
In the gentlest way he drove in the dagger. "We did, I think on 10 March [2003], get a report that chemical weapons
might have remained disassembled and Saddam hadn't yet ordered their assembly. There was a suggestion that Iraq
might lack warheads capable of effective dispersal of agents."
Ever the diplomat, however, Ehrman went on to say that the intelligence warnings had not made any difference to the
case for war. "I don't think it invalidated the point about the programmes he had. It was more about use," he said. But
he had set the tone.
On Thursday, Sir Christopher Meyer, UK ambassador in Washington from 1997 to 2003, who has already criticised the
government over Iraq in his memoirs, went for Blair, mercilessly comparing his qualities as a war leader to those of
Margaret Thatcher. "I'm not trying to make a party political point here whatsoever, but quite often I think about this:
what would Margaret Thatcher have done?" Meyer asked. "I think she would have insisted on a coherent political and
diplomatic strategy and she would have demanded the greatest clarity about what the heck happened if, and when, you
removed Saddam Hussein."
A former press secretary to John Major who can speak like a mandarin but, equally, can talk like a layman, he said Blair
had failed miserably to extract a price from George Bush for his loyalty. "We could have achieved more by playing a
tougher role... if, for example... Tony Blair had said: 'I want to help you, George, on this, but I have to say, in all honesty,
that I will not be able to take part in any military operation unless we have palpable progress on the [Middle East] peace
process and we have absolute clarity on what happens in Iraq if it comes up.' I think that would have changed the nature
— it would not have led to a rupture — it would have changed the nature of American planning. "
Even when defending UK policy, he was on the offensive. Asked if policy had been adapted to stay in line with
Washington's, Meyer added: "I wouldn't say it was as extremely poodle-ish as that." .
On Friday, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's former ambassador to the United Nations, told Chilcot he had threatened to
resign in 2002 if at least one security council resolution was not passed. He added: "I regard our participation in the
military action in Iraq in March 2003 as legal but of questionable legitimacy, in that it did not have the democratically
observable backing of the great majority of [UN] member states, or even perhaps of the majority of people inside the
UK."
Today new arguments are raging over whether the inquiry will have access to, and publish, the most sensitive
documents — including legal advice given to the government by the former attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, during the
lead-up to war. Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader, has written to Gordon Brown saying that, unless all such
material is published, the inquiry will be a sham and the public's sense that it has been denied the facts will remain.
But it will still be essential viewing nonetheless. This week will see more key witnesses. The most revealing testimony

wouldn't leave early. If the Oprah team want to come out here and one of our friends is willing to let us use their house

We've sent word that she's going to call (I think Davu is in Slovenia but should be available). I think we've got
agreement on the text after another word change or two, and Davu will know that the key issue is agreeing on a date for
a signing and submission to parliaments. We've told the Turks that it "should be" in early October. They will push back,
and if they agree to a date at all it will probably be Oct 12. That will be much harder to sell to other side, but our
minimum need is a date at least by then. Thanks.

We've sent word that she's going to call (I think Davu is in Slovenia but should be available). I think we've got
agreement on the text after another word change or two, and Davu will know that the key issue is agreeing on a date for
a signing and submission to parliaments. We've told the Turks that it "should be" in early October. They will push back,
and if they agree to a date at all it will probably be Oct 12. That will be much harder to sell to other side, but our
minimum need is a date at least by then. Thanks.

Subject: Speech
sullivanij@state.gov B6
Thanks for all your hard work on this difficult speech to get it as right as possible. Here are a few comments and
questions:
We need to work in reference and quotes from POTUS Nobel speech near the top. I haven't read it yet so not sure
what's most appriopriate. Since the speech alluded to some of the same ground, should we be explicit in asserting that
this speech further clarifies/expands/explains what this Admin means by human rights?
The points about us not being perfect and the existence of evil in the POTUS speech should be woven in more here
too. For example, in discussion on p.7 about Japanese internment, etc.
In the section about supporting individual defenders, should mention that we did that thru State Dept ceremony
honoring brave women and applaud others like Vital Voices and RFK memorial who do same. Tell story about how I was
asked to mention the name of a Guatemala activist in my sppech to the parliament there because the attention might
literally save her life.
Look forward to further discussion later today.

a signing and submission to parliaments. We've told the Turks that it "should be" in early October. They will push back,
and if they agree to a date at all it will probably be Oct 12. That will be much harder to sell to other side, but our
minimum need is a date at least by then. Thanks.

In thinking about the Kissinger interview, the only issue I think that might be raised is that I see POTUS at least once a

him from doing something problematic. Do you see this as a problem?

A big, warm hello and
As you may know, I signed up for hosting another holiday party with many Senate alum suggesting the idea as a
way of having a reunion and, hey, a party. We invited staff covering most of our years, and looks like a great collection
will come. It'll be pot-luck so not quite as elegant as before.
SO, just in case, and I'd imagine it's not possible, it'll be Monday night, 7:00 to 9:30, December 21.
No matter what, wanted you to know we are gathering yet again with our Senator Clinton bond.
love, T

Hi! Hope you all are getting some R&R as the summer wanes.
Your Africa trip has generated a lot of visibility and momentum on women's issues. I wanted to follow up on an idea we
discussed, when we met a few months ago, for raising the profile of women's issues and creating a unique platform for
you in the U.S.
You may recall that Melanne and I were developing ideas for holding events to connect people working on women's
issues around the world, and to raise the visibility of the issues in the US.
Whitney Williams has joined us to flesh out a vision for a series of conferences that would bring together policymakers
and experts from the field with women you have met around the world - and people at the grassroots level in this
country.
Each conference would be followed by a special event featuring musical, cultural and culinary celebrities (yep, celebrity
chefs) from the U.S. and other countries to generate visibility online and in the entertainment media, which would reach
a lot more people than the policy conference alone.
These events would create connections among people who often work in isolation, and generate ideas for improving
policies and practices. They'd also inspire and engage a whole new generation to get involved in global women's issues.

This approach — bringing together policy, grassroots and entertainment aspects — isn't being done by anyone else in the
development space. It would be a great way to raise the visibility of the issues, and your work on them, here at home.
We could put on several over the next year, with one on the 15th Anniversary of your UN speech in Beijing.
If you're interested, we'd like the chance to meet with you all to discuss it. (Perhaps we could get together when
everyone is in town for Capricia's swearing-in.) Would you like to do that?

I look forward to seeing you soon.

If our early assessment of today's election in Honduras holds, we will have just been witness to a remarkable thing:
Honduran voters have taken back their democracy from two failed leaders -- Zelaya and Micheletti -- who had driven
Honduras to isolation and despair.
The turnout (probably a record) and the clear rejection of the Liberal Party shows our approach was the right one, and
puts Brazil and others who would not recognize the election in an impossible position. As we think about what to say, I
would strongly recommend that we not be shy. We should congratulate the Honduran people, we should connect
today's vote to the deep democratic vocation of the Honduran people, and we should call on the community of
democratic nations (and especially those of the Americas) to recognize, respect, and respond to this accomplishment of
the Honduran people.
Finally, this Administration, which worked so hard to manage and resolve this crisis, should be the one who defines the
results and perceptions of today's vote, and not our critics on the Hill (who had no clear pathway to elections) or our
adversaries in the region (who never wanted this day to happen).

The team proposes to put out the following statement in Ian's name tonight. We are weighing a recommendation to put
out a statement in your name tomorrow.
We commend the Honduran people for having exercised peacefully their democratic, sovereign and inalienable right to
select their leaders. The apparently large and enthusiastic turnout shows that given the opportunity to express
themselves, the Honduran people have viewed the election as an important part of the solution to the political crisis in
their country.
We look forward to continuing to work with all Hondurans and encourage others in the Americas to follow the lead of
the Honduran people in helping advance national reconciliation and the implementation of the Tegucigalpa-San Jose
Accord. Significant work remains to be done to restore democratic and constitutional order in Honduras, but today the
Honduran people took a necessary and important step forward.

be held Tuesday, Dec. 1, at Church of the Incarnation, 330 W. Golf Road, Arlington Heights at 10:30 a.m. Lori passed
away in her sleep during the early morning of Saturday, Nov. 28, 2009. She is loved and survived by her husband, Bruce;
daughter, Jennifer Moroniak (nee Hofmann); and beloved son, Michael. She adored her three grandchildren, Matthew,
Brett, and Tyler. Any who witnessed the joy on her face when the three were near, also caught a glimpse into her heart
and soul. Lori was and will always be one among the most patriotic of Americans. The love she shared for her country
was only ever topped by the love for her family. "We love you, and we will miss you."

Erica, we are of course always ready to help. But I have to say the way in which these papers have been tasked has been,
frankly, chaotic. For two Fridays in a row we were sent taskers after 9 or 10 pm with short deadlines, and fulfillment of
one set of requirements has only led to another. We also note that there has not generally been an effort to distinguish
among bureaus in terms of substantive responsibilities and NEA has repeatedly had to refer USUN-W to other bureaus,
especially PRM and somewhat mystifyingly, 10.
lam honestly not quite sure what is needed now. There is already an 10-drafted paper on Israel in the UN that I cleared
Friday evening. Are you asking us to script her on that topic for her meetings? I doubt very much that Ambassador Rice's
interlocutors will seek to draw her into a discussion of the Israeli or Palestinian economies and I can't think why she
would raise that topic with them and what policy points we would expect her to make in the context of her visit. If you
really need background papers on the two economies, we can give you them.

Maura —
Your folks have been terrific (especially Oni and Tom's team) in working with us yesterday and today to get papers ready
for the trip. We continue to scrounge up the last bits and pieces from the field and here, but we've given the main
briefing books to Amb. Rice who is digesting them now, and we'll get her add ons tomorrow.
After going through things briefly with her this afternoon, there is one request that we have on the substantive front.
We'd like to get (at whatever classification level is appropriate) really two additional meaty papers for her meetings with
Netanyahu and Liberman. These would supplement the material in her book. We are aware that these will be tough
meetings, but we also view them as a good opportunity to also cover a lot of ground. There are a lot of issues not in the
current papers that could come up: from Israel in the UN system, to Iran, to settlements, to the current Temple Mount
crisis, to the Israel and Palestinian economies, to the security barrier, etc.. Tom and his team may have additional issues
they'd like her to raise as well. She'd like to be over prepared for these meetings and realizes that the SBU format has
not given your team the latitude to get that done.
In these two cases could we get classified supplemental for her BCLs with lots of background, TPs, etc. Please blow off
any length requirements, etc. — longer and more comprehensive is better in this case.
We know that doing these over the weekend is unreasonable. We can arrange to get these to her after she lands in
Israel. Would it be possible — on the high side — to get these two additional pieces by COB Monday?

Hi Cheryl - if Secy Clinton does something related to Expo in Shanghai in Nov during APEC, assuming she goes, I'd really
like to try to meet her there. Incidentally, If she goes to Shanghai, it would be viewed as odd for her not to visit the Expo
site, given the personal interest she has taken in the matter. xo - jose

S requested points that she could use to call Micheletti. The negotiations continued this afternoon and evening. It is
evident that neither party wants to walk away from the table and bear the political cost of ending the national dialogue.
It is also evident that the negotiators (especially the Micheletti team) are working to ensure their leaders cannot
collapse the talks by continuing to explore options. In this environment, a call from S is worthwhile.
The points to use in the call are:

Several people have revisited an idea I know you have heard before — that ISAF, the UN, and the U.S. Mission buy some
of their food on the local economy. This would:
provide a source of rapid income to farmers;
reduce somewhat the amount of resupply convoys;
I have asked MG Field to look into this. I know that there are health and security issues, but perhaps there are ways to
deal with them on a local basis. Richard Holbrooke

Stewart,
I went for news and indeed Guy is right. The meeting occurred yesterday and the decision was made to revoke the
government on October 29. I wonder what happened with the initial decision which was strictly concerning Minister
Dorsainvil and which was for November 20th or 21st.The idea had been sold that Michele should not be touched as the
President did not care to have a vacuum in these electoral times. Plus, Michele was finally regarded as ambitionless (not

seeking presidential powers) which is not a bad thing under the circumstances. Apparently, she, not being amenable to
sacrificing some of her Ministers...and again, she being the one to name their replacements, has brought about the
decision to do away with her altogether. The trouble is that nobody seems willing to counter the President with whom
the instructions have originated. It is a head to head match between the Prime Minister and the President. That is
obviously not good. Nobody will stand against the President elect for the Prime Minister appointed.
I will have two meetings with separate parliamentarians tomorrow. On one end the ones voting to oust her on the
other the week opposition. The frustrating thing is that none have allegiance to her, just as none have the individual
power to stand against the vote for which consensus is being secured.
The UN and other international players (at least locally) after having cried victory, success and democracy are reluctant
to openly and publically denounce the matter. After announcing a week or two ago that Haiti is the new place to invest,
how can they say anything but whatever is done, reflects good governance.
Frankly, I did not see this one coming. We need to think.
In touch tomorrow for updates.

M agreed for Tom to come but I'm not sure the statement is appropriate right now. I'd rather confirm Tom's trip and tell
Zelaya tomorrow. Should Restrepo go too? And he asked why the US military would not give them access to radar that
would help them stop drug planes?

I love how these leaders always claim they didn't know about the legislation. Same thing Karzai said.
But if this gets done, I'd like to put it out in a small way that we fixed it, just to have as a marker out there for the big
speech, whenever it is.

FYI.
We had asked Johnnie to address this issue based upon reports that Uganda had legislation moving up that was going to
criminalize homosexuality with the death penalty as a sanction.

Cheryl:
My blackberry is down so I'm sending you a quick note from Uganda via Ambassador Jerry Lanier's account.
I met this morning with President Museveni in Entebbe. I raised with him the issue of the draconian legislation
proposed to criminalize homosexual activity. Museveni was unaware of the legislation but thought it was excessive and
out of order. He said he would work with members of Parliament to revise the legislation to make it a crime for adults
to solicit or recruit minors into any homo- or heterosexual activities. Activities between consenting adults would be
stripped from the legislation. I think we rolled the worst and most concerning part of this back.
Regards, Johnnie

Really good editorial here. Really worth reading.
This Week in Copenhagen
December 12, 2009
Editorial
We didn't expect much from the first week of the global warming conference in Copenhagen. Countries need to do a
little posturing before getting down to the hard work, which is supposed to start on Monday. But the belligerent talk
from China seemed to go well beyond the usual positioning. •
•The best hope is that the talks will produce an interim understanding under which industrialized countries would
commit to fairly precise targets for reduced emissions, and others, like China, to broader but measurable goals. The
industrial countries would be expected to help poorer countries shift to less-polluting forms of energy.
That would set the stage for a legally binding deal in 2010. But there is no chance of even an interim agreement without
the enthusiastic participation of China, the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. China's absence would give other
developing countries — and the United States Senate — an excuse to do less than needed.
Beijing's recent pledge to slow the growth in emissions seemed like a positive shift in attitude. Then on Tuesday, in a
surprising show of defensiveness, China's top negotiator, Su Wei, said the greatest burden rested with the industrialized
countries and jumped on the United States, Japan and the European Union for not being aggressive enough. Another
Chinese official urged Washington to do "some deep soul-searching" and improve its proposal.
Todd Stern, the chief American negotiator, responded correctly: With emissions in many industrialized countries peaking
or declining, just about all of the growth in greenhouse gases is expected to come from the developing world between
now and 2030, half from China. Rich nations must still reduce emissions sharply, Mr. Stern said, but "there is no way to
solve this problem by giving the major developing countries a pass."
China has also been demanding that rich nations contribute hundreds of millions of dollars a year to help poor countries
address the threat of climate change. Again Mr. Stern was blunt. Washington is prepared to help those who need it, but
given China's huge reserves and revved-up economy, he said he could not envision "public funds, certainly not from the
United States, going to China."
The most positive development has been a pledge by the European Union to contribute $10.5 billion over the next three
years to help poorer countries deal with climate change. The United States has said that it will make a contribution but
has not said how big it will be.
Transparency is another difficult issue that must be resolved, at least in principle, this week. There is no point in setting
targets, or threatening penalties for noncompliance, unless countries are required to report emissions accurately.
Transparency has never been one of Beijing's virtues, and emerging countries generally need aid to create sophisticated
monitoring systems.
Copenhagen's broadest challenge is finding an equitable way to distribute the burden of confronting climate change.
Despite some differences, the industrialized nations have pretty much agreed to trim their emissions by 15 percent to 20
percent from 2005 levels in the next 10 years, and by 80 percent by midcentury. And all seem to be willing to make
expensive investments to get there. President Obama will need help from Congress, no sure thing.
A host of developing countries — including India, Brazil, Indonesia — have put broad goals on the table, though in.some
cases they seem more aspirational than real. But the bottom line is that the hope for a meaningful deal is vanishingly
small if China doesn't sign on.

I've asked Todd to identify the specific areas where he thinks progress can be made through discussions on Thursday.
At a high level, I think leaders' conversations on Thursday will begin to narrow gaps on the big issues -- transparency,
funding, inscribing commitments, etc -- IF (and it's a big if) those gaps are narrow-able. If they're not, then
Thursday/Friday will be days of trying and failing ... but at least trying.
Todd's view is that there is not enough time Friday for top-level meetings to close the deal; that two days are required.
You would be our head of delegation for the first, POTUS for the second.

Re the required report for Kerry-Lugar, I want to be sure that the language in both our report and this one echo the

I never called Patricia Espinosa--should I?
Also, have we rec'd a memo from Shaun Woodard for Robinson and McGuinness calls?
There will also be a PC on Af-Pak Tuesday and I want to be sure our report is ready.

Re: Latest on EU presidency
The political timing on the EU presidency is accelerating. Sarkozy and Merkel are meeting tonight (October 18) to discuss
it. The Czech constitutional court will issue its verdict on the legality of the Lisbon treaty on November 3. Shortly after,
perhaps that week, before you meet with Merkel on November 8-9, there may be an EU Council meeting to decide the
matter. So you may want to weigh in before then.
Tony is somewhat downcast on his chances. (He met with Jim Hoagland of the Washington Post yesterday; his mood
was described to me.) The Tories have ramped up their campaign against him—not only do they not want him but they
also do not want an effective EU president. Cameron has come down on the side of the anti-EU wing of his party on this,
an easy move. In an intriguing complication, there's talk now of David Miliband becoming EU foreign secretary if Tony
does not become EU president. Miliband denied he was interested and endorsed Tony. This is part of the anti-Blair
campaign ginned up by the Tories, extended to hurt Miliband if they can. Jonathan Powell is less gloomy than Tony,
thinks everything is still in play, which is why your part in this may yet be important.

Cheryl,
As of this hour of Thursday night there is no deal on an ironclad, substantive, political platform of national solidarity and
governance reform, in return for Abdullah's gracious concession which would obviate the constitutional and political
need for a problematic 2nd round.
Karl and I remain in close touch with the candidates as they continue their engagement. But short of a miracle, there
will be no such deal at least until Friday evening or Saturday morning, if then.
Hence, as we understand the exigencies of our Boss's travel sked, it appears to be time to pull the plug: we won't be
recommending before our Friday evening that she make a stop in Kabul on Saturday. The default remains: no Kabul
stop.
Nonetheless, Abdullah has now set Saturday as the date for his address to the nation, and Karzai clearly wants both for
him to concede, and to attract a visit of the Secretary. The best scenario would have been an announcement in the
presence of the Secretary, as a trusted witness to whom the parties would be more or less politically accountable. If we

Wed., Palau was one of only two UN General Assembly members to vote with the US against a resolution calling

did not support the US position. Important officials in Palau wanted to abstain because of the drastic cut in U.S.

Re: Cameron Blowup in Europe
Without passing "Go," David Cameron has seriously damaged his relations. with the European leaders. Sending a letter to
Czech leader Vaclay Klaus encouraging him not to sign the Lisbon Treaty, as though Cameron were already Prime
Minister, he has offended Sarkozy., Merkel and Zapatero. Within the Conservative Party the Shadow Foreign Minister
William Hague has arduously pressured for an anti-EU stance, despite his assurances to you that Tory policy toward
Europe would be marked by continuity. Cameron has attempted to straddle factions, fending off calls for a national
referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. But this letter is proof positive of his tilt to the Tory right on Europe. The European
leaders understand that the letter signals his future policy and are reacting accordingly. Cameron's presumptive strike
has accelerated the predicted Tory-European split from post-election to pre-election. Whether this affects Merkel's
attitude on Blair and the EU presidency remains unclear, but Cameron's high-handed behavior is precisely the sort of
thing that provokes her. See the Guardian report below:
Guardian
Europe leaders incensed by David Cameron's letter Sarkozy, Merkel and Zapatero criticise Tories for attempt to delay
treaty Nicholas Watt <http://www.guardian.co.uk/profileinicholaswatt> and Ian Traynor
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/iantraynor>
guardian.co.uk <http://vvww.guardian.co.uk> , Friday 30 October 2009 22.21 GMT Leaders of three of the most powerful
countries in Europe have strongly criticised David Cameron <http://www.guardian.co.uk/poiitics/davidcameron> at the
EU summit over Conservative plans to scupper the Lisbon treaty.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761367 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761367 Date: 06/30/2015
Nicolas Sarkozy, Angela Merkel and Jose Luiz Rodriguez Zapatero are understood to have privately criticised the Tory
leader after he sent a handwritten letter to the Czech president Vaclay Klaus, who is refusing to sign the treaty. The
letter was seen as an attempt to influence the Czech Republic, the only country not to have ratified the treaty.
Senior British sources familiar with thinking at the highest levels of the EU say that the leaders of France, Germany
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/germany> and Spain <http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldispain> all raised
questions about the Cameron letter.
It is understood that Cameron encouraged Klaus to delay the ratification of the treaty by setting out Tory policy to hold a
referendum in Britain on the treaty if it has not been ratified by all member states.
The sources have told the Guardian that:
*Sarkozy was overheard telling Gordon Brown that he was incensed by Cameron's letter, which the French saw as an
attempt to wreck the Lisbon treaty.
• Merkel was also said to be upset by Cameron's letter. The German chancellor is understood to have echoed concerns
of senior figures in her CDU party, such as the former European parliament president Hans Gert Poettering, that
Cameron's behaviour had been untrustworthy.
• Zapatero — who addressed the recent Labour party conference and will have to negotiate directly with Cameron if he
wins the election because Spain holds the EU's rotating presidency until July 2010 — made clear to diplomats that he
regarded Cameron's letter as damaging and an attempt to scupper the treaty.
The interventions by the EU leaders come as the Tories plan to abandon their two-year campaign to hold a referendum
on the Lisbon_treaty. Senior Tories told the Guardian that Cameron will set out his thinking in the coming weeks if, as
expected, the Czech president finally ratifies the treaty.
It is understood that Cameron will drop his pledge to hold a referendum on the treaty on the grounds that it is
impossible to open a treaty that has entered EU law. A Tory government would instead focus on repatriating social and
employment laws, in effect restoring the British opt-out from the social chapter. This has been sprinkled around various
EU treaties since Tony Blair ended the opt-out in 1997, meaning that its measures could only be restored to Britain with
the agreement of all member states.
Brown yesterday used his appearance at the summit, where he held a series of formal and informal one-to-one
meetings with EU leaders, to launch a strong attack on the Tories' approach to Europe. Speaking of the Tory decision to
abandon the main centre-right EPP grouping in the European parliament in favour of a smaller group consisting mainly
of fringe parties from the hard right in eastern Europe, the prime minister said: "The Conservative party are standing
apart from the mainstream in Europe.
"They are part of a very small group of minorities — of 23 people apart from the Conservative party. They are standing on
the fringes of Europe. That is a huge mistake for British interests."
A Tory spokeswoman said: "We have never concealed the fact that we sent the letter ... David Cameron has made no
secret of its contents. It sets out his public opinion in a private letter."

Sounds good. Huma and I will work to set it up. The budget issue is complicated -- we've had several discussions about

Call should be with Jack, Piper, Rich, Paul Jones, and Sean Misko.
Re the required report for Kerry-Lugar, I want to be sure that the language in both our report and this one echo the

Paul, Sean, and Rich are going back over to make sure of that. Our chief method is to use framing language from the

I never called Patricia Espinosa--should I?
Will check with WHA.
Also, have we rec'd a memo from Shaun Woodard for Robinson and McGuinness calls?
Huma should have this memo for you.
There will also be a PC on Af-Pak Tuesday and I want to be sure our report is ready.

From: Sid
Re: The Berlusconi assault
1. The physical attack on Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is a major political event in Italy and Europe. His
assailant is a mentally disturbed man without a political agenda who has been in and out of psychiatric care since he was
18 years old. Nonetheless, the assault has significant repercussions. It has generated sympathy for Berlusconi as a
victim—he has been obviously injured, lost two teeth and a pint of blood, and doctors will keep him in the hospital for
perhaps a week for observation. The attack comes as Berlusconi was beginning to lose political footing, having lost his
legal immunity. One court inquiry is turning up evidence of his links to the Mafia while another is examining his role in
the bribery case of British lawyer David Mills. Berlusconi's government and party have used the attack as a way to turn
the sudden sympathy for him to his advantage, claiming that his opponents have sown a climate of "hate." Through
demogogic appeals they are attempting to discredit and rebuff the legal proceedings against him and undermine the
investigative press. (Berlusconi is suing La Repubblica, the large independent newspaper in Rome that has been most
aggressive in digging into his affairs of all kind.)
2. It would seem proper and decent for the President to call Berlusconi to express his concern about his health and
wish him a speedy recovery, if he hasn't done so already. There are many reasons for Obama to do this, not least to
condemn violence against a democratically elected head of state. It would be awkward for the U.S. President not to call
a Western head of state of a NATO country who has been physically harmed. Berlusconi, for his part, would certainly

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761507 Date: 06/30/2015
make such a call public. It would therefore also be awkward if a call were used only as an element in his sympathy
campaign against the court proceedings. •
3. If so, there is a larger message that should be communicated, perhaps by the President in his conversation, but
most importantly through a statement from the State Department, also conveyed by the U.S. ambassador in Italy. The
USG condemns any and all violence as an assault on democracy. By the same measure, this incident involving an
apparently deranged individual should not be exploited to raise social tensions. Instead, it should inspire reflection on
the necessity of every citizen to adhere to the rule of law as well as to respect freedom of speech and the press.
4. Two articles on the legal inquries into Berlusconi below:
http://www.independent.co.uk/news/worldieurope/berlusconi-cut-deal-with-mafia-court-told-1834647.html
Berlusconi 'cut deal with Mafia', court told Former hitman claims Italian PM gave 'benefits' to the Mob for political
support By Michael Day in Milan Saturday, 5 December 2009 The Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, made a deal
with the Sicilian Mafia in the early 1990s that put the country "in the hands" of the Mob, a court in Turin was told
yesterday.
Gaspare Spatuzza, a jailed Mafia hitman turned witness, told a packed and heavily guarded bunker courtroom that his
Cosa Nostra Godfather boss had cut a deal with Mr Berlusconi in 1993 that provided unspecified "benefits" to the Mafia
in exchange for political support. The media tycoon entered politics a few months later and won his first term as Prime
Minister in 1994.
Spatuzza said his boss, Giuseppe Graviano, who was jailed over Mafia bomb attacks in Rome, Milan and Florence, had
told him that the Mob had "got everything" with the help of Mr Berlusconi, adding that Graviano called Mr Berlusconi
"the man from Channel 5", in reference to his TV network.
The damaging claims came at the appeal hearing of Marcello Dell'Utri, a key Berlusconi associate and senator, who is
challenging his nine-year jail sentence for links with the Mafia.
Spatuzza, in prison for several murders, testified: "Graviano told me the name of Berlusconi and said that thanks to him
and the man from our home town [an apparent reference to Dell' Utri] we have the country in our hands."
Mr Berlusconi has denounced the claims of Spatuzza as "vile", and "unfounded and defamatory", denying ever having
links with the Mafia. The Prime Minister's spokesman said the testimony yesterday was the Mafia's "completely logical"
revenge against the Prime Minister for his "determined" fight against organised crime.
Dell'Utri told the court that neither he nor Mr Berlusconi had Mafia connections. "It's in the interest of the Mafia to
force the collapse of the Berlusconi government because this government has done the most in the fight against
organised crime," he said. Mr Berlusconi, who recently lost his legal immunity to prosecution, was said to have been
furious this week, after the parliamentary Speaker, Gianfranco Fini, the man who is supposed to be his closest ally, had
said that the Spatuzza evidence was "an atomic bomb".
Mr Fini was recorded by an unobserved microphone while talking privately at an official dinner. Rumours of the
conservative Prime Minister's links with the Mob have persisted since investigators learnt that a Cosa Nostra hitman,
Vittorio Mangano, worked as Mr Berlusconi's "stable-master" at the media mogul's villa in Arcore outside Milan in the
1970s. Much speculation has also centred on the origins of Mr Berlusconi's vast wealth.
Last week, the Prime Minister's broadcast group, Mediaset, and his holding company, Fininvest, announced it intended
to sue the left-wing newspaper La Repubblica over an article that said Mediaset was "20 per cent owned by the Mafia".
La Stampa newspaper noted that the "dread combination of Mafia allegations and separation from his wife are now his
principal torments". Mr Berlusconi's estranged wife, Veronica Lario, is said to be seeking a £3m-a-month divorce
settlement, and a messy courtroom battle looms. Mr Berlusconi also faces a retrial on the charge that he bribed the
British lawyer David Mills to lie in court.

After a Court Ruling, Berlusconi's Legal Woes Resume By Jeff Israely The world has spent the past six months wondering
how — and with whom — Silvio Berlusconi spends his Saturday nights. But the combative, scandal-plagued Prime
Minister of Italy would prefer to talk about his mornings instead. "Do you know how I've been forced to spend my
Saturday mornings since I entered politics?" Berlusconi once declared to business leaders in Rome. "With my lawyers."

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761507 Date: 06/30/2015
Italy's self-proclaimed Defendant in Chief makes a point of lamenting all those weekends spoiled by stacks of court
dossiers as further proof that he is the victim of politically motivated magistrates, whom he called during the same
speech "the spreading cancer of our democracy." (See Berlusconi's worst gaffes.)
<http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1874098_1874099_1874118,00.html>
To combat such perceived persecution, Berlusconi has tested the bounds of decorous democratic conduct, including his
allies' pushing a bill through Parliament last year that gave him and other top Italian officeholders immunity from
prosecution. But since the Constitutional Court overturned that law in October, several criminal investigations into
Berlusconi's business dealings have been reopened, with other new charges rumored to be looming.
The potentially most damaging trial is set to resume Friday, Dec. 4, in Milan, with the 73-year-old billionaire being
accused of paying British attorney David Mills $600,000 in 1997 to withhold incriminating evidence about his
broadcasting empire Mediaset. Mills is appealing a conviction in the same case; both men have denied any wrongdoing.
So, alas, Berlusconi is back to spending his downtime with a well-paid cadre of more than a dozen avvocati, who have
been successful so far in keeping their biggest client clear of criminal convictions. Not that the lawyers have ever really
gone away. Since the media baron first ran for office 15 years ago, his legal advisers have doubled as political consiglieri,
key members of Parliament and even important Cabinet Ministers. Indeed, while some critics have spoken of
Berlusconi's reign as a kind of sultanate of showgirls or government by gaffe, others have described it as a republic of
attorneys. (See what Berlusconi's Obama "jokes" say about Italy.)
<http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1927307,00.html>
His longtime lawyer Cesare Previti served as Italian Defense Minister during Berlusconi's first term in 1994 before being
convicted of corruption himself (and losing twice on appeal). During Berlusconi's second term (2001-06), Gaetano
Pecorella, a former leftist, served as president of Parliament's Justice Commission, where he was instrumental in
shepherding through new laws that helped shield Berlusconi from investigating magistrates.
Giovanni Sartori, a Columbia University professor of constitutional law, says the role Berlusconi's personal lawyers have
played in his legislative agenda is yet another gargantuan conflict of interest to add to those related to his ownership of
Italy's main private television stations. But by now, Sartori says, Berlusconi's lawyers have perfected the art of exploiting
Italy's painfully slow justice system: many cases conclude without a final verdict because the statute of limitations has
been reached. "It is more a mania than a necessity," Sartori says of Berlusconi's near obsession in battling magistrates.
"He feels persecuted, and fighting the judges is what makes him happy."
Berlusconi's current point man is Nicolo Ghedini, a somber-faced, lanky 49-year-old criminal-defense attorney from the
northern city of Padua, who has served in both the Italian Senate and the lower house of Parliament. Ghedini has
continued to mount a grinding defense in the criminal cases, arguing in the Mills case that Berlusconi cannot be present
in the Milan courtroom for the next several months because of time conflicts with his duties as Prime Minister. Ghedini
has also spearheaded an increasingly aggressive legal strategy that has included several libel suits against opposition
newspapers. He declared in September that if necessary, Berlusconi would testify in a suit against a journalist who
referred to rumors that the Prime Minister is impotent. Last week, Berlusconi vowed to launch additional suits against
newspapers that printed unsubstantiated reports that a close adviser of his was involved in a 1993 bombing campaign '
by the Sicilian Mafia. (Read "An Offended Berlusconi Goes on the Offensive.")
<http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1920737,00.html>
Despite these many legal headaches, Berlusconi is embroiled in one other particularly thorny case that even he can't
blame on overzealous magistrates. Veronica Lario, Berlusconi's wife of more than 20 years, filed for divorce earlier this
year, which sparked an avalanche of accusations that he frequented a prostitute from Bari and an underage model from
Naples. The Milan daily Corriere della Sera reported last week that Lario has demanded 3.5 million euros ($5.2 million) in
monthly payments, and Berlusconi countered with an offer of 300,000 euros ($450,000). No matter how this and the
other cases shake out, there is little hope that Berlusconi can avoid a mountain of lawyers' fees and some grim
Saturdays that he'd rather devote to other business and pleasures.

Subject: Call with Sen. Lautenberg
I spoke w the Senator who is not ready to lift his hold yet. He spoke w the Charge in the Brazilian Embassy who told him
there was a procedure in the Brazilian courts that could be used to give Mr. Goldman custody now and during the
remaining time of the court proceedings.
Craig, can you find out what the Brazilians meant by that and if their govt is pursuing it?
Bob, can you and USTR contact your Brazilian counterparts to explain how important the Goldman case is to the Senator
who can't understand how the father wins every case but never gets his son back and he has run out of patience and is
willing to hold this critical bill.
Let me know what you find out. Thanks.

be messy. All flights to dc till 6pm tomorrow are basically canceled (though the 8pm is still scheduled to go). Mario has
asked us to check in tomorrow but as of now, he thinks a monday morning flight might be more reliable. There are trains
running but they expect delays, maybe cancellations. Below is lonas draft for monday. Do you want to hold off on

Sorry to bother on the Sunday before Christmas but the Echumenical Patriarch's crowd are extremely worried that he
may get arrested or otherwise harassed/attacked as a result of the 60 Minutes interview he gave which airs tonight.
Thought it was worth passing along and that you might want to get someone to pulse the Emabassy in Turkey.
Hope you are getting a little rest after one hell of a week. Notwithstanding some press whining, I thought BHO and HRC
did a fabulous job in Copenhagen and that the schedule structure has a much better chance of success than sticking with
Kyoto architecture. Congrats to all..

Dear John,
Thank you for responding to me re:the safety of the EP. Unfortunately, the 60 minutes interview has been raising
jingoistic fervor in Turkey. As I told you, the Foreign Ministry called HAH on Friday to express their dismay and concern
that He was disparaging Turkey in such a public manner. Of course, HAH expressed His love for His country, Turkey, but
reiterated the painful, laundry list of issues faced by the Greek Orthodox Christian minority. Today, many of the news
outlets in Turkey are attacking HAH saying that He has condemned Turkey's good name. One of the nationalist papers
called HAH crazy and pictured Him hanging from a cross. (see attachment) The Foreign Ministries said, acourse, that
he was sure the EP made "a slip of the tongue."
Our concern is that some nationalists will attempt to do damage to the Patriarchate or, ever worse some nut from the
Grey wolves will be let loose to hurt/kill HAH. Of course, the Government may over react once they see the full
interview. It is an honest piece of journalism - but very very tough "to face the country in the mirror". Sadly, some
Greek Nationalists fan the flames from their side as well.
I am also sending you a blog<http://www.cbsnews.com/8618-18560_162-
5990771.html?assetTypeld=58&messageld=8825797>which shows some of the the lunacy out there on this issue.
Fortunately, we have good friends like you and an Administration that believes in human rights, religious freedom, civil
rights and dignity of every individual. Above all, we believe in, and glorify, the manager-born Messiah whose message of
good will amongst women and men is best expressed in social/divine justice for everyone.
Thank you
Father Alex •

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762738 Date: 06/30/2015
Anti-gay laws sweeping through East Africa have sparked a debate in the United States about the possible influence of
American evangelical leaders and lawmakers with strong ties in that region. U.S. activists are also shedding new light on
the risks that gays face in East Africa.
In his book called The Family, American journalist Jeff Sharlet criticizes a group of influential American Christian leaders
and conservative lawmakers with close ties to politicians in East Africa.
He accuses them of treating some of the countries they deal with as social and political experiments.
"It has become sort of a Frankenstein's monster and is the family going to take responsibility for the empowerment they
have given to some of these politicians?," asked Jeff Sharlet.
In his book, Sharlet specifically refers to politicians in Uganda proposing an anti-gay law that would criminalize
homosexuality. The law, which could be passed within weeks despite international condemnation, includes possible
punishment by death.
Anti-gay laws were recently passed in Burundi, are being discussed in Rwanda, and could soon be expanded in Kenya
and Tanzania.
The American group Sharlet calls The Family is also known as The Fellowship. It organizes an annual National Prayer
Breakfast with the U.S. president and foreign guests, but besides that activity shuns publicity and does not openly list its
members.
But Sharlet says more American reporters are looking into the group and its alleged ties to Africa. These include helping
African politicians with money so they can push socially conservative agendas.
"We see reporters in Iowa, in Pennsylvania, and in Oklahoma, going to their elected representatives who have a link to
this whole thing and saying 'tell us about the link'," he said. "They are not accusing them of anything, they are saying,
'You have a relationship with the Ugandan government, what is the nature of that relationship? And, are you going to
use that influence to oppose this legislation that seems to be supported by some of your allies?"
Religious leaders like Rick Warren have also been under the microscope. He is the senior pastor of the California-based
Saddleback church, which is active in both Uganda and Rwanda.
After being questioned about his role by U.S. media, Warren issued a video message on the Internet, denying his
support for the law in Uganda.
"As an American pastor, it is not my role to interfere with the politics of other nations, but it is my role to speak out on
moral issues and it is my role to shepherd other pastors who look to me for guidance, and it is my role to correct lies and
errors and false reports when others associate my name with a law that I had nothing to do with, [and which] I
completely oppose and I vigorously condemn," said Rick Warren. "I am referring to the pending law under consideration
by the Ugandan parliament, known as the Anti-Homosexuality Bill."
Rwanda's parliament is also working to pass a law which would criminalize homosexuality but Warren has yet to address
his church's role in that matter. In 2005, he called Rwanda a "purpose driven nation." Warren went with dozens of
American evangelicals to hold meetings with government ministers, lawmakers and donate materials to churches across
Rwanda.
Several American lawmakers who have been linked to the Fellowship, like Nevada Senator John Ensign have called the
Ugandan law proposal "outrageous". But others like Kansas Senator Sam Brownback, who went to Uganda in 2004,
have said they do not know enough about the bill to comment.

The executive director of the U.S.-based International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission, Cary Alan Johnson,
welcomes some of the questions now being asked.
"It is a debate that has to happen and we are glad it is happening," said Cary Alan Johnson. "Rwanda and Uganda are
both countries with deeply spiritual people and as of late we have understood that some of the more conservative
elements in the United States have been funding the most violent and homophobic discourses about homosexuality."
Johnson says those seeking to push an agenda should understand the consequences of their actions. He warns anti-gay
laws could worsen already high HIV levels in east Africa.
"The impact of these laws on HIV prevention is extremely worrisome to us," he said. "Laws we are talking about in
Uganda, Rwanda, will make it impossible for groups to do HIV education that targets men who have sex with men or
that targets bisexual people and we know that there is a strong impact of HIV on this community and on society in
general."
Lisa Laurel Weinberg, from the Massachusetts Lutheran Social Services Human Rights Protection Project, says the
situation is already very difficult. In her other job as an asylum attorney, she recently helped a young Ugandan woman
win asylum to the United States. The woman's apartment had been raided by police while she was inside with her
girlfriend.
"The police broke in and brought them to the police station and raped them in what is called a corrective rape," said Lisa
Laurel Weinberg. "It is when males of authority try and correct lesbianism through rape."
But Weinberg warns trying to fight the new laws from the outside is very complicated.
"I got an e-mail yesterday that said be really careful and check with Ugandans before you do any advocacy from the
West, because us imposing our values, they are really sensitive to the whole colonialism history, so that the email
cautioned be careful what you do and let it come from them," she said.
Some prominent politicians and journalists in East Africa have called homosexuality the "white man's disease." Pro-gay
groups in the region, which are mostly underground, say they are becoming increasingly afraid to ask for help, and
believe outside interference could worsen the persecution they face.

I think I would want someone higher profile.
If she is doing this, it's likely as a response to incoming rather than as an affirmative agenda.
Not sure how I got to be the person pushing all things in this area -- think from the earlier efforts on family benefits but
as general matter - we have a reactive mechanism right now (to others, to me sending emails re Uganda (and now
Rwanda is doing same kind of anti-gay law)) etc.
This would be someone who's portfolio would be an affirmative agenda.

It may be worth putting together a small group to think through the issue in some depth to decide whether there is a
more proactive strategy that may be possible and/or worth engaging in one or more countries :
1. Define human rights challenges around gay communities in many of our partner countries
2. Define the social political context (ie: how does civil society and the political/legislative activity converge or not
converge)
3. Potential role of Judicial response (eg: Adult Disability Act in US)
4. Role of multilateral and normative bodies
We are quietly doing this in PEPFAR over the next two months to assess whether we can work behind the politics to
increase the "safe space" for our populations seeking and/or in care (increase identification, entry and retention).
Cheryl, I hope you have a wonderful holiday, heading back to SF now, back in Monday (28th)

What is the best way to have a systematic assessment of what countries in Africa have laws proceeding or on the books
re: anti-gay measures similar to the Uganda bill?
I am particularly concerned as we begin to make determinations in budget process for significant investments in several
countries for GHFSI, Pepfar, GHI, etc., that we not be surprised.
Can you advise how we can proceed or if we should do a call or seek a tasking for this information?
Thanks.

Hi Huma.— could you please show this to the Secretary? Senator Reid's staff and Senator Lautenberg would like the
letter below sent to his office today. Upon receipt of the letter, we are told Senator Lautenberg will lift his hold on the
GSP and ATPDA trade legislation. I know the Secretary would prefer to wait until there is a final decision in Brazil, but it
is still unclear when that decision will come (may not even be today) and we have drafted the letter so that it still makes
sense regardless of how and when the court rules. Thanks, and I'm at my desk if she wants to discuss it further. Rich
Dear Senator Lautenberg,
I appreciated the opportunity to speak with you this past weekend regarding the custody case of Sean Goldman, the
young American boy wrongfully detained in Brazil for more than five years. As we discussed, the Administration has
long maintained that Sean should be reunited with his father David in New Jersey. I have made a point of emphasizing
this position with Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim during our many conversations, as have other U.S. Officials
with their Brazilian counterparts.
We have worked closely with the Government of Brazil to ensure it upholds its obligations under the Hague Convention
on International Child Abduction. We were quite concerned by last week's decision suspending the order reuniting Sean
with his father. We were encouraged, however, by the appeal filed last Friday by the Brazilian Solicitor General which
challenges this suspension. Like you, we are eager to learn of the outcome of this appeal. We understand a decision
could be announced shortly.
You can be assured that we will continue advocating for the reunification of Sean and his father and pressing the
Government of Brazil to ensure swift consideration of the Goldman case so that this long legal process may reach a final
conclusion without further delay. In the meantime, please be assured that the State Department as well as the U.S.
Embassy in Brasilia has been and will continue to be a resource to the Goldman family during this trying time.

Dan —
I just spoke with Marie Damour, CG at Embassy Brasilia, who provided an update on the Goldman case.
A scheduled 1100 EST press conference by the attorney for the Brazilian family did not take place. Damour reports the
attorneys from both sides are still negotiating the details of the handover, as is the attorney for the Government of
Brasil. According to the 2nd Regional Federal Court, the deadline for the turnover at the Consulate falls at 0600 local on
12/24. However, there may be a push to turn Sean over to the consulate today in order to permit him to travel to the
U.S. on an overnight flight.

Subject: Latest on Goldman Decision
Dan,
I just got off the phone with Embassy Brasilia Charge Lisa Kubiske, who provided a recap of current developments in the
Goldman child custody case. Summarizing:
-- David Goldman's Brazilian lawyer and the family's attorney are currently attempting to negotiate an "voluntary
return."
--If those talks fail, Goldman will request the Brazilian police execute the involuntary return ordered yesterday by a
Brazilian judge. This outcome would create a negative PR climate.
--Brazilian police "think" they know the boy's whereabouts.
--Return to US likely will occur on an NBC News-chartered aircraft, as Goldman has inked some sort of exclusive deal w/
NBC for the story.
--Post has been working with WHA and PD on a possible S statement.
Craig Kelly just called in for the latest developments, which I passed. gm

Importance: High
I have just heard from the team in Rio that there will be no return enforcement this evening:
Tomorrow morning between 8-9, David Goldman's Brazilian attorney will go to the court to obtain the warrant
enforcing the return of Sean Goldman to the U.S. He will wait there pending coordination with relevant police and
judicial authorities to ensure that everything is ready, and they will depart for the family compound to take custody of
Sean.
• Consulate General Rio will have cars ready at 9am for transport, and the team will be ready at the airport to
facilitate departure.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762853 Date: 06/30/2015
David's attorney has spoken to judicial authorities and believes that the motions filed at STJ will not be accepted by
the court, so will not interfere with the return. This does not preclude some last minute legal maneuvers, but he seems
confident that the decision by STF will effectively cut off other avenues. We will advise asap if this changes.

Subject: RE: Goldman Decision - update as of 00:45 local time
Given the hour here, I am less optimistic that we will pull off a return tonight, but we are still working to that end.
The Brazilian Central Authority confirms that the office of Regional Federal Court President Paulo Espirito Santo
has received the decision of STF President Gilmar Mendes. It is Paulo E-S who will be responsible for enforcing the
decision from Mendes, i.e. the return of Sean Goldman to the U.S.
BCA has promised to reinforce for Interpol the urgent necessity of police in Rio monitoring the location of Sean
Goldman. Embassy LEGAT office is double-tracking. We cannot, of course, ask them to enforce anything until the
proper judicial authority has sent them instructions, but we strongly urge them to be prepared.
BCA has turned over operational jurisdiction to Daniel Levy, from the AGU's office in Rio, to coordinate with David
Goldman's attorney and with the court in Rio. I have asked David's attorney to try and get some understanding from
Mr. Levy as to the timeline we can expect to see in this case.
What remains unclear:
• We do not know if the judge from the Regional Federal Court intends to issue an execution order from his home
tonight at this late hour, or if he will wait until opening of business tomorrow morning. Note that 00B here generally
means 10am for a court. This only underscores the need to ensure that there is sufficient monitoring of Sean's
whereabouts.
We do not know how Judge Paulo E-S will interpret an "immediate" return order — it could mean right this instant,
or it could mean some brief period of time where the family is ordered/encouraged to turn Sean over at the Consulate
or some other site.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762853 Date: 06/30/2015
We are working to obtain some sense of whether this is likely to happen tonight, or if we are better served getting
some rest now and starting first thing 00B which for us means 7-8am.
We have not had confirmation regarding the resolution of the motions in STJ, but frankly, I don't foresee receiving
an answer on that before mid-day Wednesday.

PLEASE NOTE — I am aware of the intense interest back in DC about this case and will be passing information just as soon
as I receive it. This means that in most cases, I will not be able to confirm the information. Will try to identify credible
sources vice what rumor/press/others are saying.
Brazilian Central Authority (BCA) coordinating with David's attorney and the Federal attorneys in Rio to ensure that the
President of the Regional Federal Court in Rio has a copy of the STF order and is submitting the official request to federal
police to enforce. BCA says they still believe they can effect the turnover tonight and are at their office working to that
end. If/when the Federal Police enforce, their stated preference is to go to the airport and effect the handover there.
This is a scenario we've planned for.
BCA has mentioned the STJ motions filed by the Brazilian family as a potential obstacle, but thru their contacts in
Mendes' office at STF, have heard that Mendes intends to reach out to the reporting judge at STJ to resolve that issue.
As mentioned in an earlier update today, we have not had any confirmation that the STJ judge has accepted to hear the
motions filed by the Brazilian family, and has the option to decline to hear them.

If the family sees the writing on the wall (frankly unlikely at this point) and agrees to abide by the order of immediate
return, then in theory the handover would happen at the consulate and there is a plan in place for that.
Plans in motion to prevent them slipping away and Patricia Lamego is working with the police as we speak. Federal
Police repeatedly assured us they were prepped and ready to move but could take no action absent an order. They
know now there is one, so BCA will get them moving.
If the handover occurred tonight, I'm told we need 3 hours to get the plane off the ground, so overnight in the hotel.

Marie, if there is a handover tonight: that would be at the Consulate in Rio, right? Grandparents would bring Sean and
he'd spend the night...in David's hotel or at the Consulate?
It seems very, very unlikely that will happen tonight.
But if handover is delayed until morning, the family may try to slip away tonight. Can we ask the police to prevent that?

Importance: High
Here is what we know:
STF Pres. Gilmar Mendes upheld the motion by the AGU and David's attorney requesting he overturn the stay
imposed by Justice Marco Aurelio, based upon a motion filed by the maternal grandmother.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762853 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762853 Date: 06/30/2015
The order at first read appears to require immediate return of Sean.
The BCA is calling the Interpol director responsible for enforcing such actions to see if they will get set to move.
HOWEVER, BCA does not/not yet have a copy of the order, and it is the judge in the lower court in Rio that would
generally receive the order from STF and then contact DPF to enforce.
Sergio Brito, the prosecutor who has assisted David's attorney on the Hague case is attempting to contact the
judge in the court of first instance in an effort to move as quickly as possible. Note that the court of first instance is on
recess and the "duty court" judge will need to take action, but magistrates in Rio are keenly aware of the status of the
case and may be prepared to move this evening.
BCA is hoping to effect handover tonight, and will plan to send their psychologist to Rio if the handover must
happen tomorrow morning.
What we don't know:
No details yet on what else is contained in the order, which is likely to affect the next steps taken by the Brazilian
family.
No details as yet on what, if anything the Brazilian family has done in response to the news from STF.
Embassy staff are in the room with David's Brazilian attorney and will report just as soon as we have any details to offer.
Please advise me if you have any specific questions we need to pose to the team.

How do I know China wrecked the Copenhagen deal? I was in the room
As recriminations fly post-Copenhagen, one writer offers a fly-on-the-wall account of how talks failed
Mark Lynas <http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/marklynas>
guardian.co.ul«http://www.guardian.co.uk> , Tuesday 22 December 2009 19.54 GMT
Copenhagen was a disaster. That much is agreed. But the truth about what actually happened is in danger of being lost
amid the spin and inevitable mutual recriminations. The truth is this: China <http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/china>
wrecked the talks, intentionally humiliated Barack Obama, and insisted on an awful "deal" so western leaders would
walk away carrying the blame. How do I know this? Because I was in the room and saw it happen.
China's strategy was simple: block the open negotiations for two weeks, and then ensure that the closed-door deal
made it look as if the west had failed the world's poor once again. And sure enough, the aid agencies, civil society
movements and environmental groups all took the bait. The failure was "the inevitable result of rich countries refusing
adequately and fairly to shoulder their overwhelming responsibility", said Christian Aid. "Rich countries have bullied
developing nations," fumed Friends of the Earth International.
All very predictable, but the complete opposite of the truth. Even George Monbiot, writing in yesterday's Guardian,
made the mistake of singiy blaming Obama. But i saw Obama fighting desperately to salvage a deal, and the Chinese
delegate saying "no", over and over again. Monbiot even approvingly quoted the Sudanese delegate Lumumba Di-Aping,
who denounced the Copenhagen accord as "a suicide pact, an incineration pact, in order to maintain the economic
dominance of a few countries".
Sudan behaves at the talks as a puppet of China; one of a number of countries that relieves the Chinese delegation of
having to fight its battles in open sessions. It was a perfect stitch-up. China gutted the deal behind the scenes, and then
left its proxies to savage it in public.
Here's what actually went on late last Friday night, as heads of state from two dozen countries met behind closed doors.
- Obama was at the table for several hours, sitting between Gordon Brown and the Ethiopian prime minister, IVIeles
Zenawi. The Danish prime minister chaired, and on his right sat Ban Ki-moon, secretary-general of the UN. Probably only
about 50 or 60 people, including the heads of state, were in the room. I was attached to one of the delegations, whose
head of state was also present for most of the time.
What I saw was profoundly shocking. The Chinese premier, Wen Jinbao, did not deign to attend the meetings personally,
instead sending a second-tier official in the country's foreign ministry to sit opposite Obama himself. The diplomatic
snub was obvious and brutal, as was the practical implication: several times during the session, the world's most
powerful heads of state were forced to wait around as the Chinese delegate went off to make telephone calls to his
"superiors".
Shifting the blame
To those who would blame Obama and rich countries in general, know this: it was China's representative who insisted
that industrialised country targets, previously agreed as an 80% cut by 2050, be taken out of the deal. "Why can't we
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762860 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762860 Date: 06/30/2015
even mention our own targets?" demanded a furious Angela Merkel. Australia's prime minister, Kevin Rudd, was
annoyed enough to bang his microphone. Brazil's representative too pointed out the illogicality of China's position. Why
should rich countries not announce even this unilateral cut? The Chinese delegate said no, and I watched, aghast, as
Merkel threw up her hands in despair and conceded the point. Now we know why — because China bet, correctly, that
Obama would get the blame for the Copenhagen accord's lack of ambition.
China, backed at times by India, then proceeded to take out all the numbers that mattered. A 2020 peaking year in
global emissions, essential to restrain temperatures to 2C, was removed and replaced by woolly language suggesting
that emissions should peak "as soon as possible". The long-term target, of global 50% cuts by 2050, was also excised. No
one else, perhaps with the exceptions of India and Saudi Arabia, wanted this to happen. I am certain that had the
Chinese not been in the room, we would have left Copenhagen with a deal that had environmentalists popping
champagne corks popping in every corner of the world.
Strong position
So how did China manage to pull off this coup? First, it was in an extremely strong negotiating position. China didn't
need a deal. As one developing country foreign minister said to me: "The Athenians had nothing to offer to the
Spartans." On the other hand, western leaders in particular — but also presidents Lula of Brazil, Zuma of South Africa,
Caldenin of Mexico and many others — were desperate for a positive outcome. Obama needed a strong deal perhaps
more than anyone. The US had confirmed the offer of $100bn to developing countries for adaptation, put serious cuts
on the table for the first time (17% below 2005 levels by 2020), and was obviously prepared to up its offer.
Above all, Obama needed to be able to demonstrate to the Senate that he could deliver China in any global climate
regulation framework, so conservative senators could not argue that US carbon cuts would further advantage Chinese
industry. With midterm elections looming, Obama and his staff also knew that Copenhagen would be probably their only
opportunity to go to climate change <http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/climate-change> talks with a strong
mandate. This further strengthened China's negotiating hand, as did the complete lack of civil society political pressure
on either China or India. Campaign groups never blame developing countries for failure; this is an iron rule that is never
broken. The Indians, in particular, have become past masters at co-opting the language of equity ("equal rights to the
atmosphere") in the service of planetary suicide — and ieftish campaigners and commentators are hoist with their own
petard.
With the deal gutted, the heads of state session concluded with a final battle as the Chinese delegate insisted on
removing the 1.5C target so beloved of the small island states and low-lying nations who have most to lose from rising
seas. President Nasheed of the Maldives, supported by Brown, fought valiantly to save this crucial number. "How can
you ask my country to go extinct?" demanded Nasheed. The Chinese delegate feigned great offence — and the number
stayed, but surrounded by language which makes it all but meaningless. The deed was done.
China's game
All this raises the question: what is China's game? Why did China, in the words of a UK-based analyst who also spent
hours in heads of state meetings, "not only reject targets for itself, but also refuse to allow any other country to take on
binding targets?" The analyst, who has attended climate conferences for more than 15 years, concludes that China
wants to weaken the climate regulation regime now "in order to avoid the risk that it might be called on to be more
ambitious in a few years' time".
This does not mean China is not serious about global warming. It is strong in both the wind and solar industries. But
China's growth, and growing global political and economic dominance, is based largely on cheap coal. China knows it is
becoming an uncontested superpower; indeed its newfound muscular confidence was on striking display in
Copenhagen. Its coal-based economy doubles every decade, and its power increases commensurately. its leadership will
not alter this magic formula unless they absolutely have to.
Copenhagen was much worse than just another bad deal, because it illustrated a profound shift in global geopolitics.
This is fast becoming China's century, yet its leadership has displayed that multilateral environmental governance is not
only not a priority, but is viewed as a hindrance to the new superpower's freedom of action. I left Copenhagen more
despondent than I have felt in a long time. After all the hope and all the hype, the mobilisation of thousands, a wave of
optimism crashed against the rock of global power politics, fell back, and drained away.

open and accountable governments, Middle East negotiations, more civilians in Afghanistan, empowerment of women,
fewer nuclear weapons, respect for human rights, resolution of historic grievances, treaties through the United States
Senate, Six-Party Talks, dialogue with Iran, enough food for people of the world to eat, climate change legislation, and
lastly, a championship for the Boston Red Sox. Okay, that last one's not on her list, but Harold Koh and I thought it was
important that we mention that here."
It is a privilege to be a part of your team. We wish you, the President and Chelsea all the best during the holiday season
and look forward to great achievements in 2010, with one tiny exception.

Consulate will allow Sergio Tostes, attorney for the Brazilian family, into the building along with Sean and his
grandmother, Silvana. We have arranged for the party to enter directly into the building via the garage. The
grandmother announced to the press her intention to "park 3 blocks away, as the consulate would not allow her in" but
press are quoting the Embassy spokesperson Orna Blum flatly contradicting that statement, emphasizing that for Sean's
emotional well-being, and in sensitivity to Silvana and David, the reunion be safe, private, and calm.

It appears there will be no handover tonight. According to David's Brazilian attorney, the negotiators have broken
up, having not been able to agree on the issue of the Grandmother accompanying Sean to the U.S. on the plane (clearly,
the other side remains unaware of the source/nature of the charter flight that is pending a handover). We have
rebuffed attempts by the Brazilian family's attorney to "get clarification from the Americans" as an obvious last-ditch
ploy to once again present this as a U.S. vs Brazil issue. We have been clear to all parties that we the Mission have
absolutely no role in any negotiation between the parties and will not/not undertake any contact with the family or their
representatives.
Deadline for handover established by the President of the 2nd Regional Federal Court in Rio remains 9am Thursday
•
morning at the U.S. Consulate. Brazilian Central Authority confirms that the warrant authorizing enforcement of the
order has been issued and should be in the possession of law enforcement should the family not comply. BCA has
confirmed they will be in early tomorrow morning, ready to arrange enforcement should that be necessary. However,
David's attorney believes they will comply with the order and appear at the Consulate. We stand ready for multiple
scenarios.
In good news, the Brazilian Central Authority reported that the judge assigned to hear the two motions filed by
attorneys for the Brazilian family in the Superior Tribunal de Justica (STJ) has denied both motions on the merits, not just
refused to consider the motions. Links to the decisions for those who wish to read legal Portuguese are provided below.
The frequently-announced press conference by the Brazilian family/their attorney never materialized. We await
word on their next public relations foray.

Subject: RE: Goldman Decision - update as of 13:00 local time
Importance: High
I have just spoken with the Brazilian Central Authority regarding the orders imminently coming out of the office of the
President of the 2nd Regional Federal Court. He is evidently interpreting the lifting of the stay imposed at STF to mean
that the 48 hour period provided in the appellate court decision to the Brazilian family to turn over Sean to the
Consulate has started ticking again — not restarted at the beginning, but resumed ticking. According to the Court, the
deadline for turnover at the Consulate falls at 6am local time on Thursday morning, December 24. Because of the early
hour, he will evidently order the family to turn over Sean at the consulate NO LATER than 9am on Thursday, December
24. However, he will also recommend, not order, that the family turn over Sean at the Consulate today/tonight in order
to permit him to travel to the U.S. on an overnight flight and spend Christmas with the family in the U.S.
There is current debate ongoing regarding the timing of the turnover. Daniel Levy of the AGU office in Rio will evidently
take the lead in negotiating that turnover, in conjunction with David's legal team.
Press contacts are stating that Sergio Tostes, the attorney for the Brazilian family, has called a press conference at 2pm
local time (11am DC time) to announce voluntary turnover. No further details on that yet.

Subject: Goldman Decision - update as of 10:30 local time
Importance: High
Good news this morning:
Brazilian Central Authority reports that at lam local time today, the attorney for the Brazilian family contacted
Daniel Levy, the AGU attorney representing the Brazilian Govt in this case, to inform him that the Brazilian family is
willing to arrange for voluntary turnover of Sean at the Consulate General in Rio. Daniel Levy reportedly replied that he
would only facilitate these discussions on the condition that there were no further legal machinations to delay
implementation of the court order, and that the turnover happened today. We do not/not know what if any conditions
the family will try to place on a voluntary handover, so planning for police execution of the court order continues.
Interpol office in Brasilia has assured BCA and the Embassy LEGAT that they are fully aware of the status of the
•
case and are ready to provide support if Sean is not turned over. They will have action if the family attempts to hide
Sean.
We have contacted WHA Press and CA Press separately to discuss timing to release statements if/when we are
successful with wheels up.
We have discussed detailed contingency plans should the police be called upon to go to the family residence to
enforce the order if voluntary handover does not occur. Also have plans in place to supplement personnel in Rio should
this extend past today.
We have a general sense of the timing of potential events: We expect to have more clarity from the attorneys as
to whether or not voluntary handover will occur around noon/1pm local time, which is 9/10 DC time. Should police
enforcement be required, that will likely mean mid/late afternoon local time. We will advise asap if this timeline shifts
(as it is likely to do, this being Brazil.)

Subject: RE: Goldman Decision - update as of 01:30 local time - NO RETURN TONIGHT
Importance: High
I have just heard from the team in Rio that there will be no return enforcement this evening:
Tomorrow morning between 8-9, David Goldman's Brazilian attorney will go to the court to obtain the warrant
enforcing the return of Sean Goldman to the U.S. He will wait there pending coordination with relevant police and
judicial authorities to ensure that everything is ready, and they will depart for the family compound to take custody of
Sean.
Consulate General Rio will have cars ready at 9am for transport, and the team will be ready at the airport to
facilitate departure.
David's attorney has spoken to judicial authorities and believes that the motions filed at ST1 will not be accepted by
the court, so will not interfere with the return. This does not preclude some last minute legal maneuvers, but he seems
confident that the decision by STF will effectively cut off other avenues. We will advise asap if this changes.
Blackberry service does appear to be down, so if there are any questions tonight, please contact me directly on my cell
at as I am getting offline in approximately five mins. We are 3 hours ahead of DC time at the
moment, but please do not hesitate to call.

Subject: RE: Goldman Decision - update as of 00:45 local time
Given the hour here, I am less optimistic that we will pull off a return tonight, but we are still working to that end.
The Brazilian Central Authority confirms that the office of Regional Federal Court President Paulo Espirito Santo
has received the decision of STF President Gilmar Mendes. It is Paulo E-S who will be responsible for enforcing the
decision from Mendes, i.e. the return of Sean Goldman to the U.S.
• BCA has promised to reinforce for Interpol the urgent necessity of police in Rio monitoring the location of Sean
Goldman. Embassy LEGAT office is double-tracking. We cannot, of course, ask them to enforce anything until the
proper judicial authority has sent them instructions, but we strongly urge them to be prepared.
BCA has turned over operational jurisdiction to Daniel Levy, from the AGU's office in Rio, to coordinate with David
Goldman's attorney and with the court in Rio. I have asked David's attorney to try and get some understanding from
Mr. Levy as to the timeline we can expect to see in this case.
What remains unclear:
We do not know if the judge from the Regional Federal Court intends to issue an execution order from his home
tonight at this late hour, or if he will wait until opening of business tomorrow morning. Note that 00B here generally
means 10am for a court. This only underscores the need to ensure that there is sufficient monitoring of Sean's
whereabouts.
We do not know how Judge Paulo E-S will interpret an "immediate" return order — it could mean right this instant,
or it could mean some brief period of time where the family is ordered/encouraged to turn Sean over at the Consulate
or some other site.
We are working to obtain some sense of whether this is likely to happen tonight, or if we are better served getting
some rest now and starting first thing 00B which for us means 7-8am.
We have not had confirmation regarding the resolution of the motions in STJ, but frankly, I don't foresee receiving
an answer on that before mid-day Wednesday.

PLEASE NOTE — I am aware of the intense interest back in DC about this case and will be passing information just as soon
as I receive it. This means that in most cases, I will not be able to confirm the information. Will try to identify credible
sources vice what rumor/press/others are saying.
Brazilian Central Authority (BCA) coordinating with David's attorney and the Federal attorneys in Rio to ensure that the
President of the Regional Federal Court in Rio has a copy of the STF order and is submitting the official request to federal
police to enforce. BCA says they still believe they can effect the turnover tonight and are at their office working to that
end. If/when the Federal Police enforce, their stated preference is to go to the airport and effect the handover there.
This is a scenario we've planned for.
BCA has mentioned the STJ motions filed by the Brazilian family as a potential obstacle, but thru their contacts in
Mendes' office at STF, have heard that Mendes intends to reach out to the reporting judge at STJ to resolve that issue.
As mentioned in an earlier update today, we have not had any confirmation that the STJ judge has accepted to hear the
motions filed by the Brazilian family, and has the option to decline to hear them.

Subject: RE: Goldman Decision
If the family sees the writing on the wall (frankly unlikely at this point) and agrees to abide by the order of immediate
return, then in theory the handover would happen at the consulate and there is a plan in place for that.
Plans in motion to prevent them slipping away and Patricia Lamego is working with the police as we speak. Federal
Police repeatedly assured us they were prepped and ready to move but could take no action absent an order. They
know now there is one, so BCA will get them moving.
If the handover occurred tonight, I'm told we need 3 hours to get the plane off the ground, so overnight in the hotel.

Marie, if there is a handover tonight: that would be at the Consulate in Rio, right? Grandparents would bring Sean and
he'd spend the night...in David's hotel or at the Consulate?
It seems very, very unlikely that will happen tonight.
But if handover is delayed until morning, the family may try to slip away tonight. Can we ask the police to prevent that?

Here is what we know:
STF Pres. Gilmar Mendes upheld the motion by the AGU and David's attorney requesting he overturn the stay
imposed by Justice Marco Aurelio, based upon a motion filed by the maternal grandmother.
The order at first read appears to require immediate return of Sean.
The BCA is calling the Interpol director responsible for enforcing such actions to see if they will get set to move.
HOWEVER, BCA does not/not yet have a copy of the order, and it is the judge in the lower court in Rio that would
generally receive the order from STF and then contact DPF to enforce.
Sergio Brito, the prosecutor who has assisted David's attorney on the Hague case is attempting to contact the
judge in the court of first instance in an effort to move as quickly as possible. Note that the court of first instance is on
recess and the "duty court" judge will need to take action, but magistrates in Rio are keenly aware of the status of the
case and may be prepared to move this evening.
BCA is hoping to effect handover tonight, and will plan to send their psychologist to Rio if the handover must
happen tomorrow morning.

I thought I would share this heartfelt message from Patricia Lamego de Teixeira Soares, the head of Brazil's Central
Authority, the office responsible for Hague Convention abduction cases. You will see that in spite of our efforts to
protect the son, the Brazilian family chose to make a spectacle outside the Consulate this morning by parading Sean
through a crowd. Ms. Lamego recently visited the U.S. where she met with members of Congress and others to explain
all that the Brazilian Central Authority was doing to reunite Sean and his father under the Hague Convention. The
delays we saw in this case were largely the result of a wealthy, well connected family able to influence court decisions.
We are all relieved and thrilled to see this long overdue but very happy ending. I should also highlight the amazing
work done by US Mission Brazil. The consular staff, Charge, Acting DCM (Marie Damour, the Consul General in Brasilia),
LegATT, RSO, and a host of others all played a role in this successful return. My OCS DAS, Michele Bond, and her
dedicated team also played a big role in communicating with David, his lawyers, Congress, and the press. We had
Members of Congress, former Assistant Secretaries and US Ambassadors all pitching in. While there were
disagreements at times over tactics, we all agreed that we were working towards the same goal: the safe return of
Sean.
We particularly appreciate the strong support from the Secretary. Many people will try to take credit for today's happy
reunion but it was the Secretary's continued concern and interest in this case that made the difference. We could not
have provided a better gift to David Goldman during this season of giving. Janice

Dear All,
The Goldman case finally came to an end, and despite the efforts of all involved the hand over of the child to the US
Consulate in Rio was transformed into a deplorable display of the child walking in the streets with the maternal family,
being exposed to the media and to the public that surrounded the consulate.
I'm sorry this had to happen but it seems that Mr. Sergio Tostes, the maternal family's attorney, did not feel at all
embarrased to use and expose the child, who was probably under severe stress, in order to gather support for his
position. This most despicable man is not accepting the fact that, despite his life long relationships with influential
authorities in Brazil, he was unable to win the case and Sean is finally being reunited with his only real father.
I just hope that David and the Goldman family find enough time to recover their lives and their relationship with Sean.
They need time more than anything else and now it is up to the US government to guarantee that David Goldman will

not have to face the maternal family once again in the US courts where, according to Mr. Tostes last declaration to the
Brazilian press, he will "fight to defend the child".
Please allow David Goldman to live in peace with his son and have the life that he deserves after fighting so much for so
many years.
In my name and in the name of all the staff of the Brazilian Central Authority I wish David, Sean, and their family all the
best and a most happy life once they are finally back in the United States.
And to all of you who worked so much in support of this case, our deepest gratitude. We wish you all a Merry Christmas
and a very Happy New Year.

Jack—
Thanks for flagging this. We actually saw this last night, and Vikram and I had a conversation with Richard about it. The
report was based on interviews conducted in May-June, before the new policy change was implemented, so much of the
report is already OBE. OIG gave us the draft report in October, and SRAP/SCA/INL immediately sent a joint response to
OIG (attached), highlighting that we were already working on many of the issues highlighted in the report.
Given the change in policy and our letter to them, we found it pretty egregious that the OIG didn't report on the changes
underway or adjustments already made, as the report is being portrayed in the press as currently applicable. Michael
Keays on the Afghan desk and Peggy, who both help to oversee CN issues, are already working on a letter to OIG
expressing our strong concern about the report and the process which got us to this point, and Vikram and his team are
ginning up press points which also note that we have already begun to robustly address many of these points (I've cc'ed
them all on this).
If you'd like to talk further, I'm happy to come up to your office at some point this morning to discuss.

Apparently Ann Veneman won't be seeking second term at UNICEF. Is this something that should be considered? Should
we run this by Hillary as a possible consideration?

I thought I would share this heartfelt message from Patricia Lamego de Teixeira Soares, the head of Brazil's Central
Authority, the office responsible for Hague Convention abduction cases. You will see that in spite of our efforts to
protect the son, the Brazilian family chose to make a spectacle outside the Consulate this morning by parading Sean
through a crowd. Ms. Lamego recently visited the U.S. where she met with members of Congress and others to explain
all that the Brazilian Central Authority was doing to reunite Sean and his father under the Hague Convention. The
delays we saw in this case were largely the result of a wealthy, well connected family able to influence court decisions.

We are all relieved and thrilled to see this long overdue but very happy ending. I should also highlight the amazing
work done by US Mission Brazil. The consular staff, Charge, Acting DCM (Marie Damour, the Consul General in Brasilia),
LegATT, RSO, and a host of others all played a role in this successful return. My OCS DAS, Michele Bond, and her
dedicated team also played a big role in communicating with David, his lawyers, Congress, and the press. We had
Members of Congress, former Assistant Secretaries and US Ambassadors all pitching in. While there were
disagreements at times over tactics, we all agreed that we were working towards the same goal: the safe return of
Sean.
We particularly appreciate the strong support from the Secretary. Many people will try to take credit for today's happy
reunion but it was the Secretary's continued concern and interest in this case that made the difference. We could not
have provided a better gift to David Goldman during this season of giving. Janice

Dear All,

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762996 Date: 06/30/2015
The Goldman case finally came to an end, and despite the efforts of all involved the hand over of the child to the US
Consulate in Rio was transformed into a deplorable display of the child walking in the streets with the maternal family,
being exposed to the media and to the public that surrounded the consulate.
I'm sorry this had to happen but it seems that Mr. Sergio Tostes, the maternal family's attorney, did not feel at all
embarrased to use and expose the child, who was probably under severe stress, in order to gather support for his
position. This most despicable man is not accepting the fact that, despite his life long relationships with influential
authorities in Brazil, he was unable to win the case and Sean is finally being reunited with his only real father.
I just hope that David and the Goldman family find enough time to recover their lives and their relationship with Sean.
They need time more than anything else and now it is up to the US government to guarantee that David Goldman will
not have to face the maternal family once again in the US courts where, according to Mr. Tostes last declaration to the
Brazilian press, he will "fight to defend the child".
Please allow David Goldman to live in peace with his son and have the life that he deserves after fighting so much for so
many years.
In my name and in the name of all the staff of the Brazilian Central Authority I wish David, Sean, and their family all the
best and a most happy life once they are finally back in the United States.
And to all of you who worked so much in support of this case, our deepest gratitude. We wish you all a Merry Christmas
and a very Happy New Year.

Patricia Lamego T. Soares

Dear Cheryl,
I want you to know that last month a friend of mine convinced me to apply for a fellowship at Harvard/Institute of
Politics, and I did. A few days ago, I got a call from the Program Director who informed me that I was accepted. I am very
excited about it and think it will be a very good opportunity to share my experience with students who
are learning theories about democracy and development.
Cheryl, I am going to be bold and ask you if you would accept my invitation to come and speak to the students while I
am there. I am asked and encouraged to invite important personalities who can talk of their experience in government
and I thought of you. I would be thrilled if you accept. I will be there from end of January until the beginning of May next
year. I have also invited President Moreno of IDB who accepted and I am waiting for an answer from Michaelle Jean, the
General Governor of Canada.
I wish you the very best, to you and your family for Christmas and the New Year. I hope our roads cross again as we
thrive to better the lives of so many people who deserve it. Please extend my wished to the Secretary of State. I admire
her and her work.
Warm regards,

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Taliban insurgents had planned to use five Americans, now detained in Pakistan, who had
contacted the militants via the Internet, to carry out attacks in the U.S.-allied country, a police official said. Usman
Anwar, police chief in Sargodha, where the men were arrested this month, said emails had revealed plans for the young
men from Virginia to travel to a Pakistani nuclear power plant. "We believe that they were supposed to be used inside
Pakistan," Anwar told Reuters by telephone. "In their last email to the Taliban, we found they mentioned the Chashma
Nuclear Plant and that's why they were going to Mianwali (district)."

favorable. In a series of meetings we have had with the democracy and human rights groups, the response has been

That would be more than fine. I appreciate you even looking to see if this may work.
On another note I wanted to send congratulations to you on the announcement of your daughters engagement. I know
you are proud of her and rightfully so.
Also I had dinner last night with a mutual friend of ours, Sen Lindsay Graham. Lindsay always talks how much he likes
you and said if I were to be in contact with you to say hi from him.
Stay well and I look forward to hearing and seeing you soon.
All my best,

So sorry I haven't responded before but I've been hip deep in the rollout of the Afghanistan strategy. I am trying hard

Is that ok?

I hope you, the President and Chelsea had a great Thanksgiving. Hopefully things will wind down and you'll be able to
spend some time with your family. As you know, I'm being honored by the American Friends of the Hebrew University
on Thursday, March 11, 2010. I'd be so honored if you would consider being the keynote speaker. I've had some
correspondence with Lona in your office and she indicated you may have a better idea of your 2010 calendar in early
November. It would mean the world to me if you could do it, but if not I completely understand.
I look forward to seeing you soon.

greater than Defense — which is now 3 percent, which is why part of the multilateral food assistance funding is going
directly to Treasury. As they work through the details of the numbers, this is the one place that we could face a last
minute issue if the percentages get out of alignment.
In terms of policy this has all of the restorations to initiatives that we discussed last week and also adds to
MCC (OMB made this part of the agreement). In food security, with the combination of from State/USAID
and in new money will add to the multilateral initiative; we will fund the nutrition component

restore the proposal to increase in State and USAID staffing. While the staff increases will be funded at 50 percent of
the originally proposed levels, with carryover balances because prior year appropriations were delayed there will be a

much better than a pause.
While we still have a risk that the fee proposal may,not be accepted, we now have of cushion in new State
ops funding which means our absolute risk vs. current levels is only . We also get the upside that any
additional fee revenues above projections will come to State and the permanent transfer of revenues, if enacted, will
provide long term stability in State ops funding.
I talked to Karl yesterday about Afghanistan funding and I think he appreciates that we have made big progress, but he is
still thinking about weighing in on the need for full funding. I told him that we expect funding levels that will permit us

stable planning for the next 18 months. I told him that the proposed settlement made it much harder to make a
compelling case and he is weighing whether the principle of full funding of the field defined requirements is an issue
that he wants to be firm on. He understands that we went to the mat on this and he understands the character of the
arguments we faced.
I think Richard will be disappointed that the Pakistan funding level is at Kerry-Lugar-Berman levels and not higher.
Overall In a year when domestic agencies are being pressed very hard this should be seen as a big investment in State

budget documents with their staffs.
I hope this is the final budget note for the year. Best to you and your family for a happy and healthy new year.

Subject: Posner response to Washington Post editorial
Philippe and Jake asked me to send along this response to the Washington Post editorial:
By Michael Posner
The Post's Dec. 27 editorial ("Redefining Human Rights") on the Obama Administration's human rights and democracy
policies, and Secretary Clinton's recent speech at Georgetown in particular, misses the critical point: human rights,
democracy, and development are mutually reinforcing, not competing goals. They complement each other in the task of
making human rights a human reality.
President Roosevelt understood the fundamental link between liberty, prosperity and security, tying together freedom
of speech and worship with freedom from want and freedom from fear in his-famous "Four Freedoms" speech. At
Georgetown, Secretary Clinton articulated a 21st century vision grounded in this wisdom.
To accuse Secretary Clinton of embracing a Soviet-bloc approach to human rights because she includes development in a
discussion of democracy not only strains the bonds of credulity and common sense, it also walls off a crucial avenue for
ensuring that people can actually exercise the rights that are naturally theirs - including the rights to freedom of religion,
association, and speech-in their daily lives.
As Secretary Clinton made clear, policies that address development alone are not adequate: "Freedom doesn't come in
half measures, and partial remedies will not solve the whole problem," she said. But experience shows us that where
broad-based development occurs, people are more likely to demand a say in securing their futures, and governments
are more likely to have the resources to maintain the strong institutions, including reliable police and fair courts, that
help ensure the consistent protection of rights. Where people are given the right to speak freely, to participate in their
nation's political process and have access to basic information about government, sustainable development is more

likely to occur. At the same time, democracies without development do not last. These are mutually reinforcing tracks,
and the Obama Administration is committed to pursuing both simultaneously.
As President Obama said in his Nobel lecture, "engagement with repressive regimes lacks the satisfying purity of
indignation." But the Post's overheated outrage ignores the lessons learned by generations of men and women who
worked to advance human rights around the world.
To suggest that Secretary Clinton somehow provided excuses to rights-abusing dictators in a speech in which she
forcefully criticized specific abuses across the world, is simply not credible. Far from being an excuse for any regime, this
is an approach that pushes governments to do more to advance civil and political rights and to ensure that democracy
actually delivers a measure of prosperity and opportunity for all. That is the right approach for the Obama
Administration and for the 21st century.

RELEASE IN PART B5
The Secretary's Call Sheet for
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon
August 24, 2009
Purpose of Call: You are calling UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to ask him
to co-host with you an event at UNGA to advance the Global Partnership for
Agriculture and Food Security.
• UNGA Food Security Event: I would like to co-host with you an event to
advance the global agenda on food security. We see country-led processes as a
centerpiece of a new global agenda. This event would most likely take place on
Thursday, September 24, at 3:30pm. If you cannot co-host the meeting, I would
welcome the participation of your representative at the meeting.
• Event Content: We would like this event to be an opportunity for a broad
group of global stakeholders to commit to the food security principles agreed to
at the L'Aquila summit. We hope to extend the L'Aquila food security
principles to countries that were not present at the summit. The event will also
focus on highlighting country-led processes, such as the Comprehensive
African Agricultural Development Program (CAADP). I welcome your
thoughts on other issues you would like the meeting to cover. We look to the
UN to provide leadership in advancing a global agenda.
• Event Partners: We envision inviting Heads of State or senior ministers from
donor countries, signatories to the L'Aquila joint statement on food security,
and developing nations. We would also like to include foundations, NGOs, the
private sector, media, and multilateral organizations.
Background: We want Ban Ki-moon and the UN High Level Task Force to play
a leading role in combating global hunger. We believe that co-hosting this event
with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon would highlight the global nature of our
food security strategy.

Clinton set to smooth Obama's visit to China
By Edward Luce in Washington and Geoff Dyer in Beijing
Published: November 4 2009 02:00 I Last updated: November 4 2009 02:00
Hillary Clinton is on course to raise the $61m in private money needed to build a US pavilion for a trade fair in Shanghai
next year, clearing one of the main foreign policy obstacles ahead of Barack Obama's state visit to China next week.
Mrs Clinton, whose first visit as secretary of state was to China, inherited a situation where the US was the only country
other than Andorra that had failed to confirm its attendance at the Shanghai Expo - to the chagrin of the Chinese.
America's absence from the fair, running from May to October, was the first issue to be raised by the Chinese when Mrs
Clinton visited in February. 'The Chinese were very upset," says Elizabeth Baghley, who heads Mrs Clinton's office for
global partnerships. "When she came back from China she said: Whatever it takes, this matters to China and to US
business and we are going to get this done'."
The task was more arduous than expected. Unlike all the other participants in what is expected to be the largest trade fair
in history, the US administration is barred by federal law from spending a single public dollar on global trade fairs. Mrs
Clinton, who has extensive experience at fundraising as a presidential and senatorial candidate, was also prevented from
asking for money herself.
The bureaucratic obstacles were made worse by the fact the Chinese had already tapped large US companies, such as
Cisco and Coca-Cola, to spend money on their own corporate pavilions, which will face their national counterparts across
the river around the fair in Shanghai. The situation was retrieved when three companies - Chevron, GE and PepsiCo -
were persuaded to put up $5m (€3.4m, £3m) each. So far $46m has been pledged.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765149 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765149 Date: 07/31/2015
Mrs Clinton's emphasis on getting a US pavilion contrasted strongly with the attitude of the Bush administration. Some
even referred disparagingly to the "Chi-comms" - an old-fashioned abbreviation for Chinese communists. "The state
department basically saw it as a lost cause," says one state department official. "Some people laughed when they heard
Hillary wanted to do this."
Shanghai has huge hopes for the Expo, which it sees as a chance to cement the city's global brand as an international
financial centre and modern metropolis. With an official budget of Rmb28.6bn ($4.2bn) and 70m expected visitors over the
six months, the Expo has been marketed as the sort of coming-out party for Shanghai that last year's Olympics was for
Beijing - and an event to rival the great 19th century world fairs in London, Paris and Chicago.
Given such heady expectations for what will be the world's, largest fair, the absence of the US would have been
considered a huge slight and a loss of face for the Chinese. Mindful of how much it mattered to the Chinese, Mrs Clinton
saw it as an opportunity to build their trust. During strategic and economic talks with Chinese counterparts in Washington
last summer, Mrs Clinton vowed she would get it done even if she had to "build it myself, brick by brick".
Mrs Clinton was also backed by John Huntsman, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Utah, who
repeatedly told Washington how much symbolic value it would bring to China.
Mrs Clinton, who will be with the US president on his state visit next week, is expected to visit the site and may be in a
position to announce that all the money has been raised.

Subject: H: FYI. The end of Justice Jim. Sid
Supreme Court Justice Jim Johnson, known both for his segregationist political activities in the 1950s and dabbling in the
political campaign against Bill Clinton during his presidency, died yesterday.
A Faulkner County sheriff's office spokesman, Lt. Matt Rice, said Johnson was found dead in his home about 10 a.m.
Saturday with an apparently self-inflicted chest wound from a .30-30 rifle. Johnson had been beset by medical problems,
he said. Roller-McNutt Funeral Home in Conway will be handling arrangements.
He was 85. Here's a standard biographical history <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_D.johnson> . This will end his
prolific and pointed letters to the editor (unless some are still in the pipeline), delivered on stationery marked with his
name for his Conway home, "White Haven."
Justice Jim was a courtly man and lively company, gracious in social interaction with friend and political foe. But Mark
Anthony's words in Julius Caesar about men's deeds come, unavoidably, to mind. As recently as 1990, he worked in an
effort to preserve state Amendment 44, the states rights amendment aimed at curbing integration that was his
brainchild. It had long been declared unconstitutional by federal courts and was barely repealed by voters.

Dear Mr. Chairman:
I am asking your help in supporting the State and,USAID budget request kw
FY 2011. I appreciate the difficult budget environment that confronts the
Congress, but 1 strongly believe this budget request is critical to advancing U.S.
national security and our interests around the world.
Our request totals $52.8 billion — a $4.9 billion increase over 2010. 01 that
increase, $3.6 billion goes directly to "frontline states" — Afghanistan, Pakistan,
and Iraq. All other State and USA1D funding grows by $1.3 billion or a 2.7
percent increase, and allows us to tackle the transnational problems of poverty,
food insecurity, climate change, and disease that pose serious threats to American
interests.
Our diplomatic and development tools enhance American leadership.
strengthen our alliances, and build new partnerships to confront pressing global
challenges. Full funding in FY 11 will allow us to continue making tangible
progress in securing the hard fought gains achieved in Iraq, and to continue
supporting and deploying hundreds of civilians in Afghanistan and PakiS UM to help
stabilize dangerous but improving situations.
The recent attacks on United States,personnel and facilities from Juarez.
Mexico, to Peshawar, Pakistan, reinforce what We already know — America's
diplomats and development professionals are on the front lines, protecting. and
securing our vital national security interests around the world.
Congress has rightly demanded that we use all the tools in our national
security tool belt; that we put more diplomats and development experts on the
ground, shoulder-to-shoulder with our troops; and that we do everything possible
to secure America's interests around the world. We are doing our part at the State
Department and USA1D, but we need your help with the FY II request. Our

missions are increasingly integrated with those of our Defense Department
counterparts, as we have seen demonstrated time and again in Iraq, Afghanistan,
and other parts of the world. Cuts to the civilian components can no longer be seen
in isolation or having little impact on our national security strategy.
Our investments in development and diplemacy are smart, cost-effective,
and squarely in the best interests of American taxpayers and our national security.
They are also relatively small compared to the cost of active military engagement,
and they can end up delivering impactful savings. In Iraq, lbr example, our $2.6
billion request for State and USAID will allow the Defense Department budget to
decrease by about $16 billion — a powerful illustration of the return on civilian
investments.
I ask ibr your strong support of our budget request and you have my pledge
that we will work diligently to ensure that this funding is used as efficiently and
effectively as possible.
Sincerely yours,
Hillary Rodham Clinton

LEADING THROUGH CIVILIAN POWER
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON
Today's world is a crucible of challenges testing American leadership.' A glance at the headlines
— and the trend lines — explains why.
In the 21 months since President Obama took office, we have seen the effects of the H1N1 health
pandemic, an earthquake on a small Caribbean island, and floods in southern Punjab ripple
across oceans and continents. And a financial crisis in Greece, a torpedoed ship in the Yellow
Sea, and a spike in world food prices cause jitters on Wall Street and worries about our future
well-being.
Global problems — from violent extremism to worldwide recession to climate change to poverty
— demand collective solutions, even as power in the world becomes more diffuse. They require
effective international cooperation, even as it becomes harder to achieve. And they call for
American leadership, even as the world changes around us.
I began my tenure as Secretary of State by stressing the need to elevate diplomacy and
development alongside defense — a "smart power" approach to solving global problems. To make
that approach succeed, however, our civilian power must be strengthened and amplified. It must,
as Defense Secretary Robert Gates has argued in these pages, be brought into better balance with
our military power.
This effort is well underway. Congress already has appropriated funds for 1,108 new Foreign
and Civil service officers to strengthen the State Department's capacity to pursue America's
interests and advance our values. At USAID, we are doubling development officers, hiring
1,200 new foreign service officers with the specific skills and experience required for evolving
development challenges, and making more effective use of the local hires at our overseas
missions who have deep knowledge of their countries. We have begun rebuilding USAID into
the world's premier development organization, one that seeds long-term growth, includes its own
research arm, shapes policy and innovation, and uses metrics to ensure that our investments are
cost-effective and sound.
But we need to do more. We need not only to rebuild — but also to rethink, reform, and
recalibrate. During my years on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I saw how the
Department of Defense used its Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) to align its resources,
policies, and strategies for the present — and the future. No similar mechanism existed for
modernizing the State Department or USAID. One of my first acts as Secretary of State was to

2009, I launched the first Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR), a
wholesale review of State and USAID to recommend how we can better equip, fund, and
organize ourselves to meet our current diplomatic and development priorities and how we can
begin building the people, structures, processes, and resources today to address the world's
challenges in the years ahead.
The QDDR is not simply a review. It defines how to make diplomacy and development
coordinated, complementary, and mutually reinforcing. It assesses what has worked in the past
and what hasn't. And it forecasts future strategic choices and resource needs.
While the State Department and USAID have distinct roles and missions, we know that
diplomacy and development often overlap — and must often work in tandem. Increasingly, global
challenges call for a mix of both, requiring us to pursue a more holistic approach to civilian
power.
Diplomatic objectives are often more effectively secured by development gains. The resumption
of direct talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians over the summer was the handiwork of
talented and persistent diplomats. But progress at the negotiating table is directly linked to
progress building strong and stable institutions of a Palestinian state and providing Israel with
needed security. And development objectives are often more effectively secured by diplomatic
engagement. The impact of our Feed the Future program and Global Health Initiative will turn
in part on the promotion of policy reforms in partner countries, and our Millennium Challenge
Compacts are in part the product of sustained political engagement to create positive conditions
for development. In many places, including Iraq and Afghanistan, the need for mutually
reinforcing diplomatic and development strategies stems from the combined causes and effects
of violent conflict, instability, and weak states.
The two "D"s in the QDDR reflect the world as we see it today — and as we envision it in the
future. The review process relied on the wisdom and talent of exceptional people in both spheres
— State and USAID — who worked tirelessly to produce a blueprint for reforms that will be
implemented over the next four years but whose impact will stretch far beyond. This year's
inaugural QDDR, to be repeated every four years, identifies new approaches and skill sets for
diplomats and development experts, sets budget priorities, establishes planning procedures,
revises promotion incentives, and reorganizes bureaucratic structures. It focuses on three main
areas: modernizing and coordinating our diplomacy across U.S. government agencies; ensuring
that our development work creates lasting and sustainable impact; and creating a stronger nexus
of diplomacy and development — as well as better coordination with our defense partners — in
conflict zones and fragile states.
A GLOBAL CIVILIAN SERVICE
Diplomacy has long been the backbone of U.S. foreign policy. And it remains so today. The vast
majority of my work at the State Department consists of deploying diplomats and engaging in
diplomacy to address major global and regional challenges, from confronting Iran's nuclear

ambitions, to facilitating negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians, to enhancing stability on
the Korean Peninsula, to working with other governments to bring emergency relief to Haiti.
And President Obama and I certainly relied on old-fashioned diplomatic elbow grease to hammer
out a last-minute accord at the Copenhagen conference on climate change last December.
In annual strategic dialogues with a range of key partners — including Russia, India, China, South
Africa, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Pakistan — we aim to move beyond the tyranny of the inbox to
deepen and broaden our relationships and to establish a stronger foundation for addressing
shared problems, advancing shared interests, and managing differences. We are investing in
strengthening global structures like the G-20 and regional institutions from the Organization of
American States to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. This is part of our commitment
to building a new global architecture of cooperation that includes not only East and West, but
also North and South.
While traditional diplomacy will always be critical to advancing our agenda, it is not enough. We
have to expand our engagement to reach and influence wider and more diverse groups using new
skills, strategies, and tools. To that end, we are broadening the way we conceive of diplomacy as
well as the roles and responsibilities of its practitioners.
The original Foreign Service, as its name implies, consisted of people trained to manage our
relations with foreign states, principally through consultations with their counterparts in
government. This has been the main function of our Ambassadors and our embassies, as well as
the staff at the State Department. But increasing global interconnectedness now necessitates
reaching beyond government to citizens, and broadening our foreign policy portfolio to include
issues once confined to the domestic sphere, such as economic and environmental regulation,
drugs and disease, organized crime, and worldwide hunger. As those issues spill across borders,
the domestic agencies addressing them must now do more of their work overseas — operating out
of our embassies and consulates. A U.S. Ambassador in 2010 is thus responsible not only for
managing civilians from State and USAID, but also for operating as CEO of a multi-agency. And
he or she must also be adept at connecting with audiences outside of government, such as the
business community and civil society.
Consider our embassy in Islamabad. The mission includes 800 staff members; about 450 are
diplomats and civil servants from State and 100 are from USAID. A large portion of our work
there consists of traditional diplomacy — foreign-service officers helping Americans traveling or
doing business in the region, issuing visas, and engaging with their Pakistani civilian and
military counterparts. But our Ambassador also leads civilians from 11 other federal agencies,
including disaster relief and reconstruction experts helping to rebuild after last summer's historic
floods; specialists in health, energy, communications, finance, agriculture, and justice; and
military personnel working with the Pakistani military to bolster Pakistani capacities and partner
in the fight against violent extremists.
Back in Washington, my responsibility as Secretary is to ensure that the Foreign and Civil
Service personnel within the State Department and USAID are working together -- and with their
colleagues across the federal government. Our strategic dialogue with Pakistan involves ten
separate working groups and thus brings together cabinet secretaries and experts from a range of
agencies in both governments. Our dialogue with India engaged 22 different agencies; and when
3

Secretary Geithner and I traveled to Beijing in May for the second round of the Strategic and
Economic Dialogue, our delegation included civilians from over 30 agencies.
Our Foreign Service officers, Civil Service personnel, and local engaged staff at the State
Department and USAID form the backbone of our global engagement. But we need the
expertise and skill of all of our civilians across government to meet today's and tomorrow's
challenges. By drawing on the pool of talent that already exists in our federal agencies and at
overseas posts, we can build a global civilian service of the same caliber and flexibility as our
military. From the State Department, USAID, and Millennium Challenge Corporation to the
Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the Export-Import Bank, the Departments of Justice,
Treasury, and Agriculture, the Centers for Disease Control, the Peace Corps, and many others,
we must reward teamwork, collaboration and inter-agency rotations. Developing the structures
and habits of cooperation and collaboration will enable us to take full advantage of our civilian
assets.
Engagement must go far beyond government-to-government interactions. In this information
age, public opinion takes on added importance even in authoritarian states and as non-state actors
are more able to influence current events. Today, a U.S. ambassador creates ties not only with
the host nation's government, but also its people The QDDR endorses a new public diplomacy
strategy that makes public engagement every diplomat's duty, through town halls and media
interviews, organized outreach, events in provincial towns and smaller communities, student
exchange programs, and virtual connections that bring together citizens and civic organizations.
Indeed, in the 21' century, a diplomat is as likely to meet with a tribal elder in a rural village as a
counterpart in a foreign ministry — as likely to wear cargo pants as pin stripe suits.
Public diplomacy must start at the top. In Indonesia and Turkey, I conducted bilateral meetings
with government officials, but I also met with civil society leaders and appeared as a guest on
popular television talk shows. I have held town halls with diverse groups of citizens on every
continent I've visited. Public events like these are as much a part of my job as Secretary of State
as my meetings in the Foreign Ministry because the durability of our partnerships will depend on
the attitudes of the people as well as the policies of their governments.
In Washington, too, we are re-shaping the way we conceive of and conduct public diplomacy.
We are shifting away from traditional platforms and building connections to foreign publics in
regions once considered beyond our reach. It makes no sense to allocate our greatest resources to
parts of the world where our ties are already strong and secure, and to minimize our efforts in
places where engaging the public is critical to our success. This also forces us to streamline and
modernize our public diplomacy efforts across the board. When the public diplomacy staff was
decreased at our embassy in Berlin to make resources available for outreach in Central and
Eastern Europe, the staff used the opportunity to develop a leaner, more agile, and more effective
operation.
We can also leverage civilian power by connecting businesses, philanthropists and citizens'
groups with partner governments to perform tasks that governments cannot. Technology in
particular gives us new tools of engagement. One great success this year was a partnership
forged almost overnight with U.S. and Haitian mobile phone companies, the Red Cross, social
entrepreneurs, the Coast Guard and eventually the U.S. Marines. Together, we created a platform
that directed text messages locating earthquake victims so workers could rescue them. We

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772283 Date: 08/31/2015
launched a program called Text to Haiti that drew contributions from 31 million Americans who
donated $10 each. At the State Department, we continue to develop new ways to use the world's
4.6 billion mobile phones to improve the lives of people living in remote and arduous
circumstances.
Visits by American technology delegations have also produced promising avenues for innovative
partnerships in fields from agriculture to health. One such visit to Russia, for example, helped
pave the way for a public-private partnership called text4baby that will provide a mobile
application for pregnant women and new mothers to get health tips through their cell phones and
monitor their own pregnancies to determine when they should seek professional medical
attention.
As we look down the road to the forces that will shape global politics, we see more acutely how
the material conditions of people's lives can affect our national security objectives. While our
USAID colleagues lead our development work overseas, State Department employees today
from Ambassadors to civil service experts must be better versed, and more engaged, in
development issues. For this reason, I called for a broad review of our aid programs in
Afghanistan and Pakistan to ensure that they were aligned with our strategic objectives, and sent
two of our most experienced ambassadors to serve as overall foreign assistance coordinators in
Islamabad and Kabul.
This comprehensive approach is essential to our engagement in many regions. In Mexico, for
example, we continue to support law enforcement efforts to arrest and prosecute members of
drug cartels but have also begun the next phase of our Merida Initiative working with our
Mexican partners — in government, business, and civil society — to strengthen justice systems and
promote a "culture of legality" in communities. This includes supporting community watch
initiatives, expanding educational opportunities for young people so they have alternatives to the
drug trade, and strengthening citizen participation councils in every state in Mexico to ensure
that they can safely engage in real dialogue to hold authorities accountable.
When the diverse elements of our civilian power work cohesively — as in many of our embassies
around the world, and on our best days in Washington — we can see the potential impact of a
global civilian service. There is no guarantee that this comprehensive approach will achieve
every goal, especially in places where the challenges are as entrenched and complex as they are
in places like Mexico and Yemen and Pakistan. But it is the best alternative we have, and one we
must pursue.
ACHIEVING HIGH IMPACT DEVELOPMENT
I am sometimes asked why development matters to our foreign policy and why we should spend
money on people overseas when we have economic challenges at home. As counterintuitive as it
may seem, the answer is that development, when done effectively, is one of the best tools we
have to enhance our own stability and prosperity. It can help strengthen fragile or failing states;
support the rise of capable partners who can help us solve regional and global problems; and
5

advance democracy and human rights. And it is a direct expression of our values and compassion
as a people.
At the same time, we must acknowledge that, while the world's problems are vast, our resources
are not. As stewards of American taxpayer dollars, we must be strategic in pursuing the most
critical needs and making decisions based on hard evidence to ensure that our investments
deliver results. And we must also stay focused on the long-term — not simply addressing the
urgent needs of people today but building the foundation for a more prosperous future. With this
in mind, the Presidential Policy Directive on Development issued by President Obama in
September — the first by an American President -- emphasizes the importance of targeting
countries with responsible governments and favorable conditions, and coordinating assistance
with trade, finance, investment credits and other economic policies to help seed emerging
markets and foster widespread and sustainable economic growth. Economic growth is the most
lasting route out of poverty, and expanding and strengthening middle classes around the world
will be key to creating the just and sustainable international order that lies at the heart of our
National Security Strategy.
The QDDR embraces development as a process of assisted self-help in furtherance of American
interests and values. A developing country must be in charge and set its own goals for meeting
the needs of its people. Americans come to the table as partners, not patrons, lending our
resources and expertise and, eventually, putting ourselves out of business when a host country is
self-sustaining.
Today, we are putting that partnership model into practice in two signature initiatives the Obama
Administration announced over the past year: the Global Health Initiative and Feed The Future,
part of the Obama Administration's broader global food security initiative.
The Global Health Initiative recognizes that the landscape for health in many developing
countries has improved over the years, due in part to President George W. Bush's Presidential
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), his malaria initiative, and the contributions of
many other countries and organizations. But this more crowded landscape does not necessarily
improve health outcomes efficiently or for the long-term.
Consider the life of a woman in a remote African village. Within walking distance is a clinic
supported by PEPFAR, where she finds out that she has HIV and then receives antiretroviral
drugs that keep her healthy. She can make a longer journey by bicycle or bus to another clinic
offering prenatal care and immunizations. Sometimes health services come to her door, in the
form of health volunteers bringing bed nets to protect her family from malaria. Yet if she has
trouble giving birth, the nearest facility equipped to perform emergency surgery is hundreds of
miles away. And while her home has been sprayed for mosquitoes, she has no access to clean
water, so her children may escape malaria only to die from diarrheal disease.
The delivery of health services is marred by a lack of coordination among countries and
organizations, including our own government. And when governments cannot afford or don't
have the expertise to ensure that health care gets to local populations, donor countries and
outside NGOs have stepped in. That is the right response to an emergency, but in too many
places, it has become the de facto solution. As a result, the African woman's access to care is
6
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772283 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772283 Date: 08/31/2015
piecemeal, and her future care is uncertain. She is vulnerable to the vicissitudes of funding cycles
and development trends in places far from where she lives. The fundamental purpose of the
Global Health Initiative is to address these problems by tying individual health programs --
PEPFAR, the President's Malaria Initiative, maternal and child health, family planning,
neglected tropical diseases, and other critical health areas -- together in an integrated,
coordinated, sustainable system of care, with the countries themselves in the lead.
Our Feed The Future initiative is based on the same principles. To give one example from a
partner country, Bangladesh is developing its own food security investment plan based in part on
consultations in a public forum with more than 500 representatives. The strategy has been
reviewed for technical quality by independent experts and is being further refined by national
leaders and technical experts. We are now developing our own U.S. government investment plan
in support of Bangladesh's strategy, in full collaboration with other governments and
international donors.
This is what partnership looks like in practice. Partner governments will almost certainly choose
to do things differently than we might, or outline different priorities. Vetting and investing in the
government's plan may take longer than delivering services ourselves. But the result promises a
sustainable strategy that will continue even after our assistance has ended. This approach reflects
the consensus of the international community on principles for effective foreign assistance. The
QDDR embraces these principles and recommends a detailed set of mechanisms for
implementing them in the field.
The QDDR also focuses on the diplomatic side of effective development policy, building much
stronger and more systematic links between State and USAID both in Washington and in the
field.
Diplomacy can support development policy in different ways. Our most important diplomatic
effort with China in recent years -- the Strategic and Economic Dialogue — includes high-level
discussions about development, and what it means to our countries' respective and collective
efforts in Africa and elsewhere. Before the 2009 meeting of the G-8 in L'Acquila, Italy, high-
level engagement with partner governments enabled us to secure a $20 billion international
commitment to food security, building a coalition of countries willing to contribute. And at the
2009 Summit of the Americas, President Obama launched the Energy and Climate Partnership of
the Americas, bringing together all the democratically-elected governments of our hemisphere to
work toward a shared goal of clean, renewable and inexpensive energy sources. As part of that
effort, the United States and Brazil are helping seven energy-poor Central American and
Caribbean countries develop their own biofuels. This promotes sustainable economic
development and regional integration, and also helps reduce dependence on imported
Venezuelan oil.
But diplomacy and development can only be mutually reinforcing if we also get our own house
in order. The first step is to move beyond agency stove-piping and to use all the talent and
expertise within the federal government. The Global Health Initiative, for example, is jointly led
by the USAID Administrator, the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator, and the Director of the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention. Their agencies, along with the Departments of Health and
Human Services, the National Institutes of Health, and the Peace Corps, work together under the
7

overall guidance and direction of the Deputy Secretary of State. This unique leadership structure
solidifies our commitment to coordination at every level, from the White House down.
The QDDR also reinforces and reflects specific internal reforms within USAID. Administrator
Rajiv Shah has laid out an aggressive set of operational priorities called "USAID Forward" that
are designed to make the Agency more effective, accountable and transparent. Guided by the
QDDR and in coordination with the State Department, USAID Forward concentrates on
procurement, people, and policy.
Procurement reform may sound like an arcane subject removed from the realities of helping
people on the ground. Done poorly, procurement can become a bureaucratic burden. But it can
also be an opportunity for progress when it's done well. Our goal is to build local capacities in
the countries where we work by drawing on the talent and expertise of small businesses and
NGOs. Senegal, for instance, has more than 1,400 health huts, where trained by USAID provide
basic – and often lifesaving – treatments, lowering costs and moving us closer to the day when
our aid will no longer be necessary.
To reform personnel, our goal is to attract and retain development professionals who represent
the diversity of America and are skilled, energetic, and know how to solve problems.
Administrator Shah and I have observed firsthand how our best USAID staff members work as
development entrepreneurs—identifying opportunities and finding solutions that meet people's
needs. To capitalize on this kind of talent, the QDDR is focusing on how to recruit and retain
locally hired staff, the backbone of our USAID missions worldwide.
To reform policy, USAID has already created a new Bureau of Policy, Planning and Learning.
Evidence-based development must be more than a notion—it must become our reality. We will
measure our investments not by the number of programs run, but the number of children
nourished or vaccinated, and the volume of people benefiting from clean water, electricity,
teachers, medicine or jobs. We will also make sure our taxpayer dollars are well spent – by
gathering baseline data, surveying development indicators before we launch projects, and then
measuring those same indicators over the life of the project. Where our approaches are
successful, we will replicate them and scale them up. Where they are not, we will admit it, learn
from our failures, and come up with a better idea.
We will also rely on the innovations of science and technology to help us work better, cheaper,
and faster in the pursuit of high impact development. Mobile phones have already transformed
the lives of countless people in sub-Saharan Africa. Imagine what the world would look like if
off-grid renewable energy provided illumination to billions of people now living in the dark, or if
more kinds of drought-resistant seeds existed for farmers in the developing world. The QDDR
endorses USAID's creation of the Development Innovation Ventures Fund where creative
solutions will be funded, piloted and brought to scale.
In July, USAID brought together scientists and technology experts to develop "Grand Challenges
for Development." These government-sponsored competitions will challenge scientists and
engineers to develop game-changing solutions to specific development problems. Just recently,
USAID funded the trial of a vaginal microbicide that reduces the transmission of HIV/AIDS by
30 percent, a major breakthrough in HIV transmission that will give women more control over
their reproductive health. USAID and the Gates Foundation recently have joined forces to create

mobile banking in Haiti, building on effective programs in Asia, Latin America, and Africa. We
are also inviting top scientists and entrepreneurs to help us find cost-effective, simple ways to
provide clean water, vaccines, inexpensive but durable computers, micro-generators, medical
kits, and applications for cell phones.
As we undertake these efforts, we will broaden our partnerships. Twenty years ago, the
"development community" didn't exist far beyond the walls of USAID. Today, it includes
corporate leaders, philanthropists, foundations and advocates, all of whom add new skills and
perspectives. Equally important are the grassroots leaders in our communities: the religious
groups, students, and other activists who lend their passion and energy to humanitarian efforts.
These advocates and entrepreneurs are willing to challenge old orthodoxies and bring a new
mindset to their work. We will partner with them to get results.
BUILDING PEACE AND STRENGTHENING FRAGILE STATES
American civilians have long operated in conflict zones and fragile states. But today, our
diplomats and development experts are being asked to undertake missions of a scale and scope
never seen before. Our task in Iraq is to lead a broad U.S. peace-building mission. At the same
time, we are responsible in Afghanistan for helping to reduce the strength of the insurgency,
improve governance, and promote stability that will last after our troops return home. In
Pakistan, we are assisting a government and society buffeted by the global economic recession,
natural disasters, and regional instability, while supporting a counter-terrorism and counter-
insurgency campaign. Today, twenty percent of our diplomatic corps is now stationed in these
three countries -- where democracy is young, institutions are struggling to serve local
populations, society is ethnically or religiously divided, and security is an ongoing challenge.
Beyond those countries, we are working to stabilize fragile states from Somalia and Sudan to
Haiti and Kyrgyzstan.
Given this unprecedented situation, we have to ask unprecedented questions: As we plan for the
transition in Iraq, how will we protect our embassy in Baghdad or our consulate in Basra? How
will we ensure the security of reconstruction experts who must work alongside Iraqi colleagues
in villages and towns across the country? How will we generate the sustained manpower to
fulfill our many ongoing and diverse commitments in Iraq?
In Iraq, we had 170,000 troops during the surge: Today our troops stand at 50,000 assigned to
supporting Iraqi government forces. On the ground are about 1,600 civilians — diplomats,
stabilization and reconstruction experts and development professionals in charge of helping Iraq
transition to a stable and prosperous democracy. Similarly in Afghanistan, the American
contribution to reconstruction and redevelopment is now led by about 1,100 diplomats and
civilian experts who will remain there after our troops are gone. These numbers say something
important about civilian power and leadership. Properly trained and equipped, civilians are force-
multipliers. One effective diplomat or development expert can leverage as many as ten local
partners, and we have learned that when local partners build their own capacities and networks,
communities become stronger and more resilient.

Civilian leadership in addressing conflict and instability also depends on marshaling and
leveraging the varied assets of our government as a whole. Under the leadership of strong
Ambassadors and agency representatives, collaboration among American civilians from across
the government has reached a new level in Pakistan, Iraq, Afghanistan, Haiti and elsewhere. We
are pooling the expertise of civilians at State and USAID, as well as DoJ, Commerce, Treasury,
DHS, HHS, CDC, and other agencies. The United States cannot succeed in these fragile states if
these agencies aren't working together. That means organizing ourselves internally with a focus
on integration, cohesion, and solving problems. For example, the creation of the office of the
Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan — with 16 agencies represented — was an
innovation to overcome agency compartmentalization and to achieve a comprehensive strategy.
The QDDR also draws on the talents of the Civilian Response Corps, which has identified
hundreds of civilian experts across the government who can be quickly deployed to conflict
zones or fragile states. The Secretary sent the CRC's expeditionary conflict and security experts
to Southern Sudan, deploying them quickly enough to support our Sudanese partners as they
prepare for potential independence after decades of conflict.
The QDDR recommends building rapid response diplomatic teams and specially trained experts
who can operate effectively over the longer term amidst conflict and instability. The State
Department will focus on complex political crises, and USAID on disaster response, building on
its abilities to get relief and recovery workers into the field within 24 hours after a disaster
strikes. We will also create a joint operating framework and response plan that will allow State
and USAID to work more effectively together and with other agencies.
Although Afghanistan and Iraq have occupied much of the world's attention for the past eight
years, they are not the only places where diplomats and development experts are responsible for
helping to shore up fragile and failing states, deal with the consequences of political, economic,
and social instability, or join in common cause to prevent conflicts in the first place. Indeed,
since the end of the Cold War, the State Department and USAID have steadily taken on more
missions in difficult and dangerous places, from Lebanon to Bosnia to East Timor.
In Sudan we are mounting a civilian surge around the southern capital of Juba to prepare for the
January 2011 referendum that will determine whether South Sudan secedes from the North.
In Yemen, our embassy is working to address economic conditions and the ravages of poverty in
a country that has recently faced a secessionist movement in the south, a rebellion in the north,
and a persistent threat from al Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula. Through the diplomatic Friends
of Yemen and concentrated efforts to stabilize fragile local communities and create opportunities
for economic growth, we are trying to help the Yemeni government provide better services for its
citizens and to prevent conflict. The QDDR anticipates more situations requiring rapidly
deployable civilian teams of diplomats, stabilization and reconstruction experts, and
development professionals that can meet our needs in circumstances like Sudan or Yemen while
also mounting larger efforts in other countries at the same time.
Training a new generation of diplomats, development professionals, and peace-building experts
will help us strengthen weak, fragile or violent states and offer opportunities and hope to their
citizens. Poverty and repression do not automatically engender terrorism but countries that are
impoverished, corrupt, lawless or mired in a recurring cycle of conflict are more prone to

becoming havens for terrorists and other criminals. Al Qaeda first operated out of Sudan and
bombed U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania before migrating to Afghanistan, then a country
notable for its poverty, high infant mortality and repressive Taliban government. It is no
coincidence that al Qaeda is most active today in underdeveloped nations such as Pakistan,
Somalia, Yemen, Mali, Mauritania and Niger.
Beyond terrorism and violent extremism, the world already has witnessed too many tragic
examples of what happens when good governance is absent. We have seen drug cartels exploit
the absence of strong governing institutions and push countries on several continents to the brink
of becoming narco-states. Elsewhere, countries rich in minerals and diamonds have become
epicenters of violence — including gender-based sexual violence -- because the central
government is unwilling or unable to combat corruption, regulate legitimate business, or invest
natural resources wealth in the country's infrastructure and people. And too often, conflicts in
fragile and weak states spill over borders, creating humanitarian crises and spawning grounds for
terrorists and global criminal networks elsewhere.
On the positive side, however, we have also seen the effectiveness of civilian power working
with our military to impede conflict and contribute to stability. In Liberia, as fighting between
rebel groups and government forces under the leadership of Charles Taylor intensified and the
humanitarian situation deteriorated, the United States undertook intense diplomatic efforts,
including public calls for Taylor's resignation, as well as military deployments to the region to
help shore up peacekeeping efforts of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS). Taylor's resignation paved the way for a comprehensive peace agreement that led
to the end of Liberia's conflict and set the stage for Liberia's stabilization and reconstruction
efforts. Both the United Nations and the United States continue to partner with Liberia as it
rebuilds social and economic infrastructure destroyed by years of conflict. Our future depends
on the success of all these types of missions — from Iraq and Afghanistan to West Africa -- and
our ability to mount more of them.
The American people must understand that spending taxpayer dollars on diplomacy and
development is in their interests, especially when those investments support missions in conflict
zones, fragile states, and states that can play a responsible role in their regions and in the world.
And Congress, which has a long tradition of bipartisan support for traditional diplomacy and
development, must appreciate the scale and scope of the reconstruction and stabilization
missions that our civilians are being asked to undertake. Congress must provide the necessary
funding now.
The House and Senate have appropriated hundreds of billions of dollars for the military missions
in Iraq and Afghanistan. The diplomatic and development activities represent a fraction of that
cost, yet the funding often gets bogged down in the old debates over foreign aid. We have to
move beyond the past and treat diplomacy and development as national security priorities and
smart investments in our future stability and security. We can succeed, but only with the
necessary Congressional leadership and support.
Perhaps no one understands the urgency of this as much as Secretary Gates. As he said last
August: "Congress is part of the problem. When I sent my budget to the Hill for roughly $550
billion, the Senate voted me $550 billion as the budget allocation Hillary Clinton sent up a
budget of about $50 billion, and they whacked four or five billion dollars out of it. So there has

to be a change in attitude in the recognition of the critical role that agencies like State and AID
play . . . . for them to play the leading role that I think they need to play in most of these
situations."
Our emphasis on civilian power is in keeping with America's history and traditions. The
Marshall Plan was a civilian development initiative undertaken in partnership with European
governments. President Kennedy founded the Peace Corps to show the world a different face of
America decades before the term "soft power" was coined. American diplomats helped
negotiate the reunification of Europe in 1991 without a shot fired. Meanwhile, American
civilians have enjoyed the world's admiration because of their spirit of innovation, abundant
goodwill, and the audacious belief that technological, social and political advances can and must
be used to improve the lives of human beings around the world.
The men and women who volunteer for our armed forces exemplify this spirit. So do the
growing number of civilians who find ways to engage in public service. With the right balance of
civilian and military power, we can advance America's interests and values, lead and support
other nations in solving global problems, and forge strong diplomatic and development
partnerships with traditional allies and newly emerging powers. And we can rise to the
challenges of the world in the 21st century and meet the tests of America's global leadership.

An Alliance Larger Than One Issue
By JOSEPH S. NYE Jr.
Cambridge, Mass.
SEEN from Tokyo, America's relationship with Japan faces a crisis. The immediate problem is deadlock over a plan to
move an American military base on the island of Okinawa. It sounds simple, but this is an issue with a long back story
that could create a serious rift with one of our most crucial allies.
When I was in the Pentagon more than a decade ago, we began planning to reduce the burden that our presence places
on Okinawa, which houses more than half of the 47,000 American troops in Japan. The Marine Corps Air Station
Futenma was a particular problem because of its proximity to a crowded city, Ginowan. After years of negotiation, the
Japanese and American governments agreed in 2006 to move the base to a less populated part of Okinawa and to move
8,000 Marines from Okinawa to Guam by 2014.
The plan was thrown into jeopardy last summer when the Japanese voted out the Liberal Democratic Party that had
governed the country for nearly half a century in favor of the Democratic Party of Japan. The new prime minister, Yukio
Hatoyama, leads a government that is inexperienced, divided and still in the thrall of campaign promises to move the
base off the island or out of Japan completely.
The Pentagon is properly annoyed that Mr. Hatoyama is trying to go back on an agreement that took more than a
decade to work out and that has major implications for the Marine Corps' budget and force realignment. Secretary of
Defense Robert Gates expressed displeasure during a trip to Japan in October, calling any reassessment of the plan
"counterproductive." When he visited Tokyo in November, President Obama agreed to a high-level working group to
consider the Futenma question. But since then, Mr. Hatoyama has said he will delay a final decision on relocation until at
least May.
Not surprisingly, some in Washington want to play hardball with the new Japanese government. But that would be
unwise, for Mr. Hatoyama is caught in a vise, with the Americans squeezing from one side and a small left-wing party
(upon which his majority in the upper house of the legislature depends) threatening to quit the coalition if he makes any
significant concessions to the Americans. Further complicating matters, the future of Futenma is deeply contentious for
Okinawans.
Even if Mr. Hatoyama eventually gives in on the base plan, we need a more patient and strategic approach to Japan. We
are allowing a second-order issue to threaten our long-term strategy for East Asia. Futenma, it is worth noting, is not the
only matter that the new government has raised. It also speaks of wanting a more equal alliance and better relations
with China, and of creating an East Asian community — though it is far from clear what any of this means.
When I helped to develop the Pentagon's East Asian Strategy Report in 1995, we started with the reality that there were
three major powers in the region — the United States, Japan and China — and that maintaining our alliance with Japan
would shape the environment into which China was emerging. We wanted to integrate China into the international

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772449 Date: 08/31/2015
system by, say, inviting it to join the World Trade Organization, but we needed to hedge against the danger that a future
and stronger China might turn aggressive.
After a year and a half of extensive negotiations, the United States and Japan agreed that our alliance, rather than
representing a cold war relic, was the basis for stability and prosperity in the region. President Bill Clinton and Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto affirmed that in their 1996 Tokyo declaration <http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/n-
america/us/security/security.html> . This strategy of "integrate, but hedge" continued to guide American foreign policy
through the years of the Bush administration.
This year is the 50th anniversary of the United States-Japan security treaty. <http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/n-
america/us/q&a/refahtml> The two countries will miss a major opportunity if they let the base controversy lead to
bitter feelings or the further reduction of American forces in Japan. The best guarantee of security in a region where
China remains a long-term challenge and a nuclear North Korea poses a clear threat remains the presence of American
troops, which Japan helps to maintain with generous host nation support.
Sometimes Japanese officials quietly welcome "gaiatsu," or foreign pressure, to help resolve their own bureaucratic
deadlocks. But that is not the case here: if the United States undercuts the new Japanese government and creates
resentment among the Japanese public, then a victory on Futenma could prove Pyrrhic.
Joseph S. Nye Jr., a professor of government at Harvard and the author of "The Powers to Lead," was an assistant
secretary of defense from 1994 to 1995.

him to seek to see the Secretary to share some of his thoughts on Africa and current issues being confronted there. I
told him of course and suggested that he reach out to you to try to arrange that dialogue. Hopefully that is ok from your

International Relations and Political Science than in any other field. The
whole student body is around 1200 in number and deliberately kept to that size
to keep quality up and to continue to rely on a teaching system that is almost

The Institute's most revered alumnus is George C. Marshall. His library is

I am a member of the advisory board of the "International Relations and

from time to time to truly "Distinguished Diplomats. " Under that rubric have
been included a few who were not strictly diplomats but who have been of great

Google has been wierd about this whole deal but this whole Espo experience has been fascinating. Some companies will
say absolutely no for months (Qualcomm, Bloomberg, .1&.1) and then pop out of nowhere and say yes. Others like All are
in for and then decide not to give us a penny. Therefore we have to keep bugging these guys.
We WILL raise the money. We are at $54M+ (this wk Hawaii came in for $500k and Bloomberg LLC and need $7M
more. Ideally we would like to raise $10 to 11M to cover any overruns (it's getting more expensive because the US was
so late we are paying more now to build it quicker).
Where it will come from?
A- Right now we have three big companies talking to us in the range of each - Monsanto, Disney, and Oracle.
Haier may go from If two or three come thru big we are done.
B- We also have a number of other companies like Invitrogen, Hormel, Mattel and Major League Baseball in the
range.
C- Interestingly the cities and states are going to their private funders and trying to raise money on their own to
promote their jurisdictions - Chicago, Houston, Georgia, Montana, TN. (In the past, over 20 states participated with
public funds but current budgets are tough). Maybe a chat w Mayor Bloomberg would be worthwhile. For example, I
spoke to the University of WA and they will probably get benefactors to cosponsor at $250k making them the only
university represented.
D- We have approached groups like Pharma and the fashion industry thru Diane von Furstenburg to get them to bundle
smaller companies and both have agreed to do it. I met w DVL and she wants you to know that she is very excited about
helping (they are in the range).
E-We have talked to the elusive Chamber of Commerce again about getting SME's to raise $2-3M in smaller increments.
They are contemplating it.
Finally the two obvious industries that are not involved are the banks (and we know why) and the insurance companies
who are starting to look into the market over there.
Anyway, I did not mean to go on and on but that's where we stand and these are the potential areas to tap. We'll get
there.

Google has been wierd about this whole deal but this whole Espo experience has been fascinating. Some companies will
say absolutely no for months (Qualcomm, Bloomberg, J&J) and then pop out of nowhere and say yes. Others like ATT are
in for and then decide not to give us a penny. Therefore we have to keep bugging these guys.
We WILL raise the money. We are at $54M+ (this wk Hawaii came in for $500k and Bloomberg LLC and need $7M
more. Ideally we would like to raise $10 to 11M to cover any overruns (it's getting more expensive because the US was
so late we are paying more now to build it quicker).
Where it will come from?
A- Right now we have three big companies talking to us in the range o each - Monsanto, Disney, and Oracle.
Haier may go from . If two or three come thru big we are done.
B-We also have a number of other companies like Invitrogen, Hormel, Mattel and Major League Baseball in the
range.

promote their jurisdictions - Chicago, Houston, Georgia, Montana, TN. (In the past, over 20 states participated with
public funds but current budgets are tough). Maybe a chat w Mayor Bloomberg would be worthwhile. For example, I
spoke to the University of WA and they will probably get benefactors to cosponsor at $250k making them the only

They are contemplating it.
Finally the two obvious industries that are not involved are the banks (and we know why) and the insurance companies

Subject: Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative - Award to Secretary Clinton
Importance: High
Hello and Happy New Year Jim,
Friends of WFP has decided to provide its annual "Leadership in the Fight Against Hunger" Award to Secretary Clinton
this year. The award is presented at a ceremony on Capitol Hill (within one of the House/Senate caucus rooms).
Approximately 200 people attend the event including Members of Congress, NGO representatives, business leaders,
administration officials and other leaders in the fight against hunger.
As you know, Friends of WFP is a non-profit organization dedicated to addressing global hunger. Its board members
include former agriculture secretary Dan Glickman, former Senators George McGovern and Bob Dole, YUM Brands CEO
David Novak, former NSC Advisor Sandy Berger and others. I established the organization in 1997.
Before officially announcing Secretary Clinton as this year's award recipient, we hoped to confirm that Secretary Clinton
will be available to personally accept the award. We plan to schedule the award ceremony in September on either a
Tuesday or Wednesday evening (at approximately 6:30/7pm). We would select the specific date based on Secretary
Clinton's schedule.

I think the ceremony would provide another good opportunity to shine a spotlight on the unprecedented commitment
of Secretary Clinton and President Obama to addressing global hunger. Thank you for your help in engaging the
appropriate officials in the State Department.
All the Best,

Subject: Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative Update
Friends,
As 2009 comes to a close, we wanted to provide you with an update on the U.S. Global Hunger and Food Security
Initiative and share with you what is to come in the new year.
First, a word of thanks for the input that many of you provided on our Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative
consultation document. We received a large amount of interest and excellent suggestions on the document, and we will
soon release a new version that reflects this input.
We are also drafting an implementation plan that will describe in greater detail how we intend to implement the
initiative. We look forward to sharing both documents with you.
In recent months, we have continued to garner international support for the five core principles for global food security
that form the basis of our strategy. In November, all UN member states endorsed these principles at the World Summit
on Food Security in Rome.
1) Invest in country-owned plans
2) Foster strategic coordination
3) Strive for a comprehensive approach to food security
4) Ensure a strong role for the multilateral system
5) Ensure sustained and substantial commitment by all partners to investment in agriculture and food security and
nutrition
In establishing the Rome Principles, the international community declared a new business model for coordinated action
to increase global food security.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772567 Date: 08/31/2015
Translating these principles into action, on December 6-8, the Government of Rwanda, together with the
Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program, hosted a technical review of its Agriculture Sector Investment
Plan and convened a high-level stakeholders meeting. At the meeting, development partners and the African
Union/NEPAD endorsed Rwanda's plan and agreed to mobilize support for scaled-up financing. The African
Union/NEPAD and representatives from the World Bank, UN, donor countries, the private sector, civil society
organizations, and NGOs attended the meeting.
The United States was represented by a whole-of-government team led by Special Assistant to the President Gayle
Smith that included representatives from the Departments of State, Treasury, and Agriculture, USAID, and MCC. Our
team committed to improve the quality of our aid; to provide robust financial commitments and technical support; and
to work to mobilize additional financing of the Investment Plan.
In the new year, we will continue to engage all stakeholders, work with the international community, and build on our
experience in Rwanda as we move forward with plans to implement our initiative.
Please continue to visit our website: www.state.gov/s/globalfoodsecurity to stay informed of planning for the initiative
and to provide input.
We wish you a happy new year and look forward to continuing to work closely with you.
The Global Hunger and Food Security Team

Its not like a traditional trade show/expo with specific booths. It is more subtle and the pavilion folks would negotiate

Depdg on amount, they get on the big wall of contributors, we show multiple scenes of NYC in the shows and displays,
they can use the wonderful VIP lounge/auditorium to have NYC day or week at the Expo - the rockettes, Broadway goes
to China, commercial diplomacy, mtgs betwn NYC and Chinese officials, .getting SME's access to China etc. We could
really be creative.
LA, San Fran, San Antonio already in, chicago on way...
As you know the general theme is "Better Cities, Better Lives". How can NYC not be repped? They cam brag about their

Ms Mills,
I got your email address in a message from my good friend, Kathleen Townsend, several months ago but have never
wanted to bother you directly. However, as the former head of humanitarian operations at USAID under Pres. Clinton, I
thought it appropriate to commend you and your colleagues on the excellent job that is being done in the early days of
the USG response to the tragedy in Haiti. The deployment of Coast Guard and SouthComm resources, the immediate
organization of an interdepartmental group to coordinate USG efforts, the deployment of multiple USAID urban search
and rescue units as well as a DART, and the ability to make these decisions without delay is impressive. Managing
information flow with early statements by the Pres. and Sec. followed by your press conference on relief plans
effectively focused attention on the US leadership role. Please pass on my "good job" to whomever has been leading
this effort. It's as good as I have seen from the USG. Let me know if there is anyway I can be of help.
Hugh

Judith:
I hope you've been well. Following up on the Secretary's request, when would you like to regroup about
communications support in Pakistan?
As food for thought, I've been talking with She's a great source of insight and
information on the ground, with a valuable independent perspective. She is very tuned into the government's
communications challenges and opportunities.
In her view, while the need is more urgent than ever, the government does have positive programs and policies that
would generate good will if people knew about them. Communications seems to suffer both from a lack of perspective -
politicians are obsessed with politics in the capital, rather than the needs of people at the grassroots - and a lack of both
practical expertise and proactive strategy. They need a plan for publicizing initiatives that benefit people, as well as
hands-on training and support to execute effectively.
This sounds very similar to the situation my team dealt with in Lebanon, where we worked with the government,
political parties and NG0s. We learned not to let a state of crisis be an obstacle to moving forward with a
communications program - they're always in crisis and, as you know, effective communications is part of the long-term
solution.
I know there may be concern about working with US consultants. One approach would be to work through NDI, which
has great contacts and credibility on the ground. That's how we did it in Lebanon.

I hope some of this is useful food for thought. You may recall that, when we met before the holidays, I showed you the
program we did in Lebanon. Would you like me to put together ideas for a program in Pakistan?

We share your assessment of Pakistan's need for a public narrative and better capacity to communicate effectively.
Judith has been working on how we improve our comm work there, and I know you were talking to the Pakistani
Ambassador about helping them. I'm copying Judith and asking that the two of you discuss what we could do given the
very difficult political landscape.
Thx for all your good counsel. We need to follow thru on the campaign for women we discussed some months back. Are

to a strong start.
Of course I was kidding about "running away" from your "long list" of things you wanted to talk about with me. I'm
happy to talk anytime.
In fact, it would be good to touch base on the women's initiative and Pakistan. I've been talking with NDI's highly
regarded country director in Pakistan, who says communications is a desperate need and will definitely do some good
for the government.
Look forward to seeing you again soon. All the best, Doug

Subject: How to Address Global Burden of Chronic Disease
Dear Hillary,
I wanted to pass on some thoughts we are formulating on how to address the global burden of chronic disease and get
your input We could have a short call about this if you have time..
I have been thinking about how Paul Farmer created a whole movement around infectious disease globally and how we
can apply that to chronic disease -- and yes - I would love to meet him and talk with him about this problem.
So here's the problem.
1. By 2020 global mortality from chronic disease will claim 50 million lives compared to 20 million for communicable or
infectious disease and currently mortality in DEVELOPING WORLD is 29 million people a year from chronic disease.
2. As you know in the US, chronic disease care (usually at end stage in acute settings) accounts for almost 80% of health
care expenditures. This is likely to increase globally and in developing countries because countries like India have
diabetes rates of 25%. Mortality from heart disease in China in 35 to 44 year olds has increased 300% in the last few
decades.
3. Global Funding for prevention and treatment of the causes of chronic disease doesn't match the disease burden by
an unacceptable margin.
4. Less than 5% of funding from governments, NGO's, private foundations is for chronic disease (i.e. World Bank - $4.5
billion to health sector work, 2.5% for non-communicable disease and Global Fund focuses only on HIV/AIDS, malaria
and TB and the WHO spends $7.50 for infectious disease and $0.50 for chronic disease, Gates Foundation: no funding
for chronic disease).
So here's what I see as the solution
We need a movement to create awareness, build the messaging, fund comparative research on innovative methods for
preventing and treating chronic disease, develop changes in medical education to scale training for providers in effective
prevention and treatment of chronic disease, build partnerships and support for demonstration projects and other
initiatives, and develop health information technology platforms to support chronic disease prevention and care as an
integrated system and other disruptive technologies.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772605 Date: 08/31/2015
There are a lot of potential partners for this -- but I was thinking that a strategic alliance could be made between the
Institute for Functional Medicine and the Clinton Foundation (and potentially other key partners) to build and scale this
movement -- then it would be much easier to raise awareness and raise money. I have a lot of donors who would fund
something like this but it has to have organization and clout and staying power.
I also wonder if Chelsea would be interested in being part of/leading this initiative - it seems right up her alley and I
know she is looking for a job in June!
And I also realized that the State Department plays a large role in global health issues and there are ways the State Dept
can help address the chronic disease epidemic globally.
Many of pieces of this are already in place and happening - for example the VA of New England wants to bring the
Functional Medicine model into the care of their patients. The health system in Colombia is implementing a model
based on Functional medicine because they cannot cope with their chronic disease burden. CIGNA wants to bring this
into their 11 million subscribers. We are building a research institute at Harvard and clinical programs. But it all needs
organization and strategy and coordination and funding in an integrated way.
Would you have a few minute to talk about this in the next week or so?
Hope you are staying warm Thanks again for all your help and support
Fondly,
Mark

When I spoke to this morning she said that the Secretary had called, and she said, "I can't tell
you how much it meant to us." She went on to say that she and her husband were very moved by the Secretary's words
and by how much everyone cares.

are traveling; and 2) ask if you might be willing to call her Sunday morning to give her a read out of your trip b/c she has
a briefing in Brussels and having a first hand report from you will allow her to forestall a trip to Haiti in the next week.

Dear Hillary and all.
We arrived at the general hospital last night with 1500 people sick or dying with 40 percent needing surgery. It has no
water electricity or food and very limited surgical suites or supplies It the largest and most well known public hospital in
the city and according to NH and paul farmer needs to be supported and it's infrastucture needs to be rebuilt.
Right now we have surgeons but not enough operating rooms set up. We
desperately need to get a generator and fuel and surgical lights and surgery supplies not just first aid. There are
hundreds including children with festering wounds needing amputation and emergency
surgical care. The doctors nurses and patients have no food or water.
Can you help get the infrastructure of electricity water and a medical hospital tent for post op patients. We are
operating with headlamps and hacksaws rinsed with alcohol.
If we have the electricity and water we can open 11 operating rooms tomorrow if we get what we need. Can the
military help ASAP and for security of equipment and medication.
Until this morning when did the first amuptation there was almost no surgery happening at all here in the city and B6
none at the General.
Five days after the quake with no acute surgical care wounds are
festering patients are getting septic and dying. If we had a little
help with basic servcices we could stop this.

Good morning Roberta! Congratulations on a successful visit by the Secretary of State. We are looking forward to this
afternoon's teleconference. After opening remarks, Minister Cannon will ask ?rime Minister Bellerive to speak and the
UN (we may only have DPKO LeRoy on line due to visit of Sec Gen to Haiti). He will then ask FM Amorim and Sec State
Clinton to provide their views on the situation and then open the floor to Kouchner and others. Response has been good
and most will be represented at FM level (Mexico/Espinosa may still be in flight from Japan, and Argentina and Costa
Rica will be Vice-Ministers).
There is as well agreement in principle to begin laying the groundwork for a broader Donors Conference on
Reconstruction and our offer to host a preparatory meeting on January 25th has been well received. However, early
indications are that the EU has a conflict as they have their General Relations and Foreign Relations meetings scheduled
for that day. As the EU would be essential for such a meeting we are scrambling to look for alternative dates. Given the
momentum we would rather go earlier than later. Minister Cannon would be available to host this on the weekend of
the 23-24th of January (dinner on the 23rd, meeting on the morning of the 24th). However, I believe that Ambassador
Jacobsen had indicated that Mrs. Clinton has another engagement on the 23rd. Could you please let me know, before
this afternoon's teleconference, if in principle, Mrs.Clinton might be available to attend a meeting in Montreal on the
evening of the 23rd or the morning of the 24th?
Many thanks Roberta.

In looking at my schedule, I could talk w you by phone Sunday or Monday, rather than meeting, which would give you

What times would be good to talk tomorrow or Monday?

Child Trafficking Major Concern After Quake
Thousands Of Children Left Without Parents
By Mike Paluska, CBS Atlanta Reporter
POSTED: 4:58 pm EST January 14, 2010
UPDATED: 5:28 pm EST January 14, 2010
ATLANTA -- UNICEF and international adoption agencies said getting children into safe zones is a top priority after the
devastating earthquake in Haiti.
The massive magnitude 7.0 earthquake that hit the island of Hispaniola has left thousands of children without parents.
Before the quake even hit UNICEF statistics from 2007 show there were 380,000 orphans already in Haiti.
"There are so many children that are in desperate need of help that's what we are here to do to keep them alive and get
them the nutrients they need and clean water. It becomes the one place of stability for the kids where they have people
UNICEF workers they can relate to they have educational material so they can start back with school," said Alissa

Silverman, deputy director for UNICEF in the southeast region. "UNICEF is tracing family members and caring for
children orphaned by the disaster to protect them from harm or exploitation."
The number of children on the island is staggering. Forty-six percent of Haiti's population (nearly 10 million) is under the
age of 18, more than half of the population is under 21. Prior to the earthquake, four of every 10 children lived in homes
with mud floors or severely overcrowded conditions.
"My first concern is who is with the kids how many of our nannies our ok and who is watching the kids and then all the
kids on the streets," said Chareyl Moyes, the program manager for Wasatch International Adoption. Moyes works with a
number of different agencies and orphanages in Haiti. She said early reports about how much damage they suffered are
good.
"But, there is going to be a concern about child trafficking so both Haitian and the United States governments are going
to be careful about forging ahead with new adoptions. The need is going to be great," Moyes said.
A lot of families in the U.S. according to a number of international adoption agencies across the country said some
people were at the very end of the process to adopt a child from Haiti. "Now, it will set everyone back," Moyes said.
Even though child trafficking is a major concern for Moyes she worries about the immediate help children need trapped
in the rubble from a country in ruins. "How long will that child survive without somebody rescuing them," Moyes said.

Save the Children Emergency Team Reaches Haiti <http://www.westportnow.com/index.php?/v2/comments/26294/>
An emergency response team from Westport's Save the Children successfully reached Haiti today and worked quickly
with staff already on the ground to organize the distribution of tents, medicine, and toiletries to children and families in
desperate need, the charity said.
"Save the Children is extremely concerned about the well-being of children in Haiti at this critical moment and we are
doing everything we can to quickly get relief supplies to those who need it most," said Charles MacCormack, president
and CEO of Save the Children, in a news release.
"Our staff on the ground is pulling out all the stops to overcome hurdles like blocked roads and unreliable access to the
airport."
"This is just the beginning of what will be a comprehensive five-year effort to build back better in Haiti. We are
dedicated to not only addressing the immediate needs of children and families, but to making sure they have a brighter
future ahead."

As someone in the anti-trafficking news of the disaster in Haiti has my mind rushing to worrying thoughts on how the
disaster will increase human trafficking in the country. Such a large scale disaster will undoubtedly leave thousands and
thousands of children, and their families, at an increased to be victimized by modern slavery.
Haiti's Restavek system still has a tight grip on the community, leaving some 300,000 children in the country enslaved as
domestic workers according to the UN. It is these children who will continue to anguish and suffer the most in the
shadows of the earthquake.

the long history of friendship between the people of Haiti and the people of the United States and their mutual respect
for each other's sovereignty;
the grievous suffering of the people of Haiti, including the massive loss of life, widespread injuries, and extensive
damage to public infrastructure and private property;
the urgent need for an immediate response to the requests by the Government of Haiti and the paramount importance
of safe, swift and effective implementation of rescue, relief, recovery, and reconstruction efforts;
the current, unprecedented challenges facing the Haitian Government; and

Dear all:
To update you, at G we have been working on water and World Water Day (the event planned takes place at the
National Geographic Building), since I am taking on water as the key issue I am/will working on. I sent S a memo on
water in December outlining our plans. Note that we are mandated to report to Congress annually as part of the "Water
for the Poor" Act.
I have met with Kern-Ann, with OES "water" staff in the last weeks to address this and also with several regional bureau
A/S (Carson, Feltman, Blake so far) on water in the respective regions.
There is a great deal of interest on their part and we have started outlining specific initiatives that we could focus on.
We've also met on the Nile Basin Initiative, with World Bank "experts" leading NG0s, McKinsey, etc. I've also spoken to
Raj (USAID allocated about $480 million in FY 2009 to water, and MCC about $500 million) but of course he has been
unable to focus on this. And Cheryl and I haven't spoken yet about Food Security/water.
Best,
Maria

One other thought.
If the idea of building network of small new schools is just nuts given the infrastructure challenges, an alternative is
more of the 'street school' approach. We take storefronts, little mom and pop storefronts, etc...and do minor
reconfiguration and you have a whole set of little street schools clustered around central location. This could work,
poses some challenges re: isolation of teachers, ability to offer a robust set of classes/offerings, but can still do the job,
and can still have clear grand openings to help jumpstart culture, etc.

Hey Cheryl,
Here are some quick thoughts on re-building school infrastructure in Port-au-Prince. Feel free to share with whomever
you'd like.
I have little idea of the larger context here — how many schools/kids are we looking at, but one thing we've learned in
the US in the last 5 years is that good teachers are the #1 lever of change in education. If we got 1,000 really great
teachers into Port-au-Prince (w/ even a modicum of support and materials), they'd make a big difference and touch the
lives of 30,000-60,000 kids.
I think this is totally doable, in short-order, in a magnificent way that could set the foundation for a well-educated
generation of Haitians who could lead the country out of poverty, to self-sustainability, self-governance and openness.
To do--
Goal 1: Bring immediate influx of human capital into education sector in concentrated areas, and map out plan for long-
term development of teachers/human capital.
Goal 2: Build curriculum, instructional materials that will support current Haitian elementary age students learning the
academic and related skills they need to lead country to long-term sustainability.
Goal 3: Build/reconstruct schools and training centers that will support high quality education, and on their own,
motivate and inspire children, families, and communities to send children to school.
Goal 4: Create (develop) family, community, economic, cultural, socio-political infrastructure that encourages and
support all children going to school through elementary school, with goal of eradicating illiteracy and expanding the
average level of education for Port-a-Prince residents to the [6th/8th] grade.
Goal 1: Human Capital:
Create Haiti Teacher Corps. Model loosely off of Peace Corps/Teach for America, CityYear
Teacher corps (US): Recruit, train, and place 500-1000 teachers from US this spring and summer. We can do this.
o Recruiting: Limit variable this year, and build up and out as we go. This spring we go to Georgetown, Univ of
Maryland and Univ of Miami and University of Florida/S. Florida. Given crisis, current opportunities in the US, we could
easily hire 500 college graduates of very high quality from 4 major universities under 2 year contracts.
o Summer institute is 8 weeks in US; language training, intensive teacher training; onsite at two major universities
(College Park, Univ. of Miami).
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772909 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772909 Date: 08/31/2015
o Language/culture training: TDB — find the best folks out there to train in French/Creole, and Haitian culture,
current socio-political situation — 50% of the training program.
o Academic training: We'll work w/ TFA and others and develop 8 week intensive teacher training program for other
50% of program.
Teacher Corps (Haitian):
o I need to learn more on this...but this would likely be critical both short-and long-term.
o Need to know who/how to recruit. Avoid political pitfalls; focus on what we've learned about good teachers—you
want people who have excelled in something—almost anything; so, we set up recruiting team on the ground in Haiti to
find cohort of 500 new teachers; training is nearly identical to US teaching corp (i.e., modeled off of TFA summer
institute).
o Training: either bring them over to US to live and learn w/ US counterparts, or if that's too precarious, look to
move them out of the city for 6-8 weeks over the summer. Find space 100 miles out and build summer camp/institute
for them.
Teacher leaders/principals/trainers:
o Much easier than you'd think. Huge network now in the charter and ed reform community of hard-working,
mission-driven teacher-leaders who would take this on.
o (US Based) TFA/New Teacher Project alumni are in schools all over the US. They have taught for 2-6 years, want a
chance to do something totally meaningful. This is is. We'll recruit 100-200 of them, and they will lead cohorts of 20
teachers...
o Haiti-based: Less clear what the teacher-leader pipeline is like...but we can figure out and get whoever we can.
Compensation, related.
o We should build dorms/apts for people. Serve food in cafeteria's on-site at the schools; have community kitchens
available, etc.
o All US staff gets paid minimally during their tour/commitment, but earns stipends/completion bonuses. If folks
convinced their expenses will be covered, they will have money to spend, we then backload this. So, might be a $10,000
salary and a $10,000 bonus upon completion. You live cheap; two years later, you get check that amounts to what you
would have saved if you had been living, working, paying bills, etc. in the US.
o Not sure about how to do Haitian pay. But structure similarly.
What do we need to accomplish the Human Capital Goal?
o In the US, not much.
A small staff of the right people could recruit, interview, assess and hire 500 corp members and we could get that
done between Feb 1 and June 1, 2010—easily.
§ Cot:
2-4 staff on board by 2.1; 10-15 staff on board by 3.1.10; that team will get everyone hired by 6.1.10

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772909 Date: 08/31/2015
Summer training institutes: 500-100 teachers, housing at universities; training/supervision staff at 1:20 ratio to
recruits
8.1.10—Teaching Corp heads to Haiti, ongoing cost of housing, stipends/salary, health care, training/supervision,
etc (we could build out draft operating budget quickly, but not doing that now).
o In Haiti, less clear, but I think if we identify the right people, we'd concurrently recruit, interview, assess, hire 500
people.
Staffing and Cost: See notes above re: US recruitment and training. Assess current status in Haiti, and set up
staffing, recruiting, hr function.
Concurrently, we have team that is developing summer training materials, and working on curriculum/content
(see below).
-
Concurrently, we have team that is working on facilities (see below)
-
Concurrently, we have team working on community outreach (see below).
Goal 2: Build a robust curriculum and teacher instruction program
We need to immediately tilt teaching and learning in the early grades to the skills and contents that are necessary in
Haiti so that it people can enable it grow and develop economically, politically.
I am not a curriculum expert, but I think this is really doable, as well, so long as we get the right team—which in this case
is likely a team of leading experts from Haiti, possibly other countries that have intentionally undergone an intensive
ramp-up in the education sector, and US curriculum writers.
US-Team:
o Similar to above, there is incredible talent in the charters, and in a few major cities where structural education
reform has taken hold.
o We just need a small team to join us for 1 year to help us jump start the project.
-
Haiti/Other countries:
o We need to talk w/ folks in Haiti and find current state of curriculum, standards, instructional guides, books,
materials, etc.
- Backwards Mapping: This is not as hard as it seems.
o We get the right people to help us figure out what a 10-12 year old Haitian should know and we map backwards,
all the way to preschool.
o Once we get an end goal in key areas – math, reading, writing, history/social studies, science...we map backwards
and start to define what we will teach.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772909 Date: 08/31/2015
o And once we decide this, we use some of the tools we've developed in the US in the last 5-10 years to help us
write curriculum, produce instructional materials.
o This will be a jumbled mess to start...but will work and sort itself out.
o We build it in clusters and in modules that can be swapped in and out, and mixed and matched. You want to give
teachers tools so they can be successful with kids of different ages and abilities, particularly early on when we're likely
to be operating more like one-room school houses than grade level schools we're used to here.
o We build in assessments, standards, and teach teachers how to recognize when kids are falling behind, how to
build in supports and tutorials.
o The goal is to get large cohort of younger kids, I think, who start to learn and be taught to standards...all the while,
we push hard in the upper grades, knowing it will be a lot less clear (and possibly much more directed towards helping
current teens develop basic skills they need to be employable and contributing members of the rebuilding efforts –so
this may be basic literacy, key vocational skills, etc.).
Cost/staffing: Small US team that works with Haitian/other country team. Within a year or so, this team should be
Haiti-based, w/ possible long-term support/membership from the US team. The start-up team sets up framework,
establishing learning standards, builds tools and cranks out curricular materials—some of which are developed
specifically for Haiti, but many of which may be translations from high quality materials from US and elsewhere.
Goal 3: Build high quality, durable schools that entice families, children into education.
In spite of current situation, this seems like another very doable goal.
Get some schools built quickly to entice attendance.
o Once rebuilding starts up, we can build schools quickly, affordably. And once they are up, if done correctly, they
will immediately be attractive to families and communities. This, ironically, will be the case if we can get schools up
quickly—while much of the other infrastructure is still in poor shape. Families will Want kids in schools if the schools are
safe, offer food, health care and structure—much of which will be wanting in devastated, poor neighborhoods.
- I'm not facilities expert, either; this is an area where we can look to other examples in the developing world for
best practices. Nonprofits and governments have worked together to build great schools in many places in Africa, South
America, and even recently in the Middle East.
To think about: Consider technology and technology infrastructure as a part of the initial construction plan so it's
not add-on later.
To think about: Keeping the schools small, functional, really basic will help us get them up; including significant
health care and related services complicates planning, build-out, but increases functionality.
Cost/staffing: I don't have enough knowledge about this, particularly in Haiti. I think it would be quite easy to find
the best models and quickly develop turnkey model for design/build that would ensure functionality, safety, and cost
compliance.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772909 Date: 08/31/2015
Once we have this, we either develop this capacity internally, or contract out and get these built, quickly.
Goal 4: Create family, community impetus for all school age children to be in school
This is both the end-game and a necessary condition along the way.
The simpleton in me thinks that highly engaged, spirited teachers, inside safe, modern school buildings that serve
healthy meals at no charge will, for some period of time (years) be a catalyst for socio-political change. And if we can
get traction for a few years, and get large cohorts of young children actively engaged in school, then it will be hard to
unwind the long-term, salutary benefits.
Clearly, if families remain in poverty, and adults have no means to earn enough money to support families, then
children of all ages, but particularly as they move toward teen years, will be attracted to alternatives other than school—
some legitimate, but low-wage, and others illegal and destructive.
In short-term, while we are developing program, we should be doing extensive community outreach and in all
cases, getting neighborhoods and communities engaged in the pre-planning process. Families everywhere get excited
about a new school, new teachers, and a new chance. And w should play on this—this will enable us to do necessary
planning around enrollment, student/family needs, etc. We shouldn't sort of move slowly from no school to some
school, we should go from no school to a new school and fresh start—even if that delays opening a bit. The first day
should be major community event, that everyone can reflect upon and hold to in difficult times.
Gotta run. See you shortly.

2-4 staff on board by 2.1; 10-15 staff on board by 3.1.10; that team will get everyone hired by 6.1.10
Summer training institutes: 500-100 teachers, housing at universities; training/supervision staff at 1:20 ratio to
recruits

• 8.1.10—Teaching Corp heads to Haiti, ongoing cost of housing, stipends/salary, health care, training/supervision,
etc (we could build out draft operating budget quickly, but not doing that now).
o In Haiti, less clear, but I think if we identify the right people, we'd concurrently recruit, interview, assess, hire 500
people.
Staffing and Cost: See notes above re: US recruitment and training. Assess current status in Haiti, and set up
staffing, recruiting, hr function.
Concurrently, we have team that is developing summer training materials, and working on curriculum/content
(see below).
Concurrently, we have team that is working on facilities (see below)
Concurrently, we have team working on community outreach (see below).
Goal 2: Build a robust curriculum and teacher instruction program
We need to immediately tilt teaching and learning in the early grades to the skills and contents that are necessary in
Haiti so that it people can enable it grow and develop economically, politically.
I am not a curriculum expert, but I think this is really doable, as well, so long as we get the right team—which in this case
is likely a team of leading experts from Haiti, possibly other countries that have intentionally undergone an intensive
ramp-up in the education sector, and US curriculum writers.
- US-Team:
o Similar to above, there is incredible talent in the charters, and in a few major cities where structural education
reform has taken hold.
o We just need a small team to join us for 1 year to help us jump start the project.
-
Haiti/Other countries:
o We need to talk w/ folks in Haiti and find current state of curriculum, standards, instructional guides, books,
materials, etc.
Backwards Mapping: This is not as hard as it seems.
o We get the right people to help us figure out what a 10-12 year old Haitian should know and we map backwards,
all the way to preschool.
o Once we get an end goal in key areas – math, reading, writing, history/social studies, science...we map backwards
and start to define what we will teach.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772910 Date: 08/31/2015
o And once we decide this, we use some of the tools we've developed in the US in the last 5-10 years to help us
write curriculum, produce instructional materials.
o This will be a jumbled mess to start...but will work and sort itself out.
o We build it in clusters and in modules that can be swapped in and out, and mixed and matched. You want to give
teachers tools so they can be successful with kids of different ages and abilities, particularly early on when we're likely
to be operating more like one-room school houses than grade level schools we're used to here.
o We build in assessments, standards, and teach teachers how to recognize when kids are falling behind, how to
build in supports and tutorials.
o The goal is to get large cohort of younger kids, I think, who start to learn and be taught to standards...all the while,
we push hard in the upper grades, knowing it will be a lot less clear (and possibly much more directed towards helping
current teens develop basic skills they need to be employable and contributing members of the rebuilding efforts –so
this may be basic literacy, key vocational skills, etc.).
Cost/staffing: Small US team that works with Haitian/other country team. Within a year or so, this team should be
Haiti-based, w/ possible long-term support/membership from the US team. The start-up team sets up framework,
establishing learning standards, builds tools and cranks out curricular materials—some of which are developed
specifically for Haiti, but many of which may be translations from high quality materials from US and elsewhere.
Goal 3: Build high quality, durable schools that entice families, children into education.
In spite of current situation, this seems like another very doable goal.
Get some schools built quickly to entice attendance.
o Once rebuilding starts up, we can build schools quickly, affordably. And once they are up, if done correctly, they
will immediately be attractive to families and communities. This, ironically, will be the case if we can get schools up
quickly—while much of the other infrastructure is still in poor shape. Families will want kids in schools if the schools are
safe, offer food, health care and structure—much of which will be wanting in devastated, poor neighborhoods.
I'm not facilities expert, either; this is an area where we can look to other examples in the developing world for
best practices. Nonprofits and governments have worked together to build great schools in many places in Africa, South
America, and even recently in the Middle East.
To think about: Consider technology and technology infrastructure as a part of the initial construction plan so it's
not add-on later.
To think about: Keeping the schools small, functional, really basic will help us get them up; including significant
health care and related services complicates planning, build-out, but increases functionality.
Cost/staffing: I don't have enough knowledge about this, particularly in Haiti. I think it would be quite easy to find
the best models and quickly develop turnkey model for design/build that would ensure functionality, safety, and cost
compliance.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772910 Date: 08/31/2015
Once we have this, we either develop this capacity internally, or contract out and get these built, quickly.
Goal 4: Create family, community impetus for all school age children to be in school
This is both the end-game and a necessary condition along the way.
The simpleton in me thinks that highly engaged, spirited teachers, inside safe, modern school buildings that serve
healthy meals at no charge will, for some period of time (years) be a catalyst for socio-political change. And if we can
get traction for a few years, and get large cohorts of young children actively engaged in school, then it will be hard to
unwind the long-term, salutary benefits.
Clearly, if families remain in poverty, and adults have no means to earn enough money to support families, then
children of all ages, but particularly as they move toward teen years, will be attracted to alternatives other than school—
some legitimate, but low-wage, and others illegal and destructive.
In short-term, while we are developing program, we should be doing extensive community outreach and in all
cases, getting neighborhoods and communities engaged in the pre-planning process. Families everywhere get excited
about a new school, new teachers, and a new chance. And w should play on this—this will enable us to do necessary
planning around enrollment, student/family needs, etc. We shouldn't sort of move slowly from no school to some
school, we should go from no school to a new school and fresh start—even if that delays opening a bit. The first day
should be major community event, that everyone can reflect upon and hold to in difficult times.
Gotta run. See you shortly.

Subject: Border Issues Update
The latest regarding border issues:
a) Per EmbOff, border at Jimani remained disorganized but functional as in recent days.
b) The flow of persons across the border is constant, but no mass influx. However, official figures under-report the
numbers of people crossing, as the data reflect only those being processed correctly. Some Haitians are sneaking across
the border, per USG official. Haitian media also report "tens of thousands" leaving Port-au-Prince, some for the DR
border. However, police officials say they have not seen increased illegal entry attempts in the mountains around the
Jimani crossing.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772918 Date: 08/31/2015
c) A Haitian immigration official said that as of 1pm on 1/19 he had issued approximately 600 laissez-passes to
travelers without documents. Dominican authorities at the other side of the border crossing are generally turning away
travelers without a valid visa or official travel document. Medical emergency cases continue being allowed in.
d) The border crossing at Jimani was closed for 45 minutes after the Haitian colonel in charge of customs on the
Haitian side began demanding "manifests" from vehicles trying to bring assistance across. GODR officials managed to
talk the colonel into backing down, but plan to seek his removal. (Note: It is unclear whether this was an attempt at
rent-seeking by the Haitian official, but some reporting implied that. End Note).
e) As the next Market Day in Jimani will be Thursday, efforts are already underway to see if market activities that day
can be organized so as not to block/hamper through-put of assistance / evacuation vehicles.

Dear Burns:
It has been some time since we spoke so I wanted to start by wishing you a happy new year and thanking you for your
assistance in placing our corporate contribution for Haiti Relief through the Clinton Foundation.
My hope is that you can further help me with two very different requests related to the Haitian tragedy:
1. After the tsunami devastated parts of Indonesia in 2004, I felt strongly that the CEOs of American
corporations involved in the planning, construction and operation of civil, energy, water and telecommunication
infrastructure should lead a charitable effort involving human as well as financial resources to develop an
implementation plan for the rebuilding of the country once the Red Cross, the Military and the other "first responders"
had stabilized the situation. I think the concept is even more relevant in 2010 with respect to Haiti which obviously is
much closer to the United States and has much less indigenous skills and resources of its own to apply to the rebuilding
effort. Given President Clinton's normal powers of persuasion and his passion for improving Haiti even before the
earthquake (it was the only thing he wanted to talk about when Isabella and I met with him in November), he would
have little difficulty recruiting a group of appropriate CEOs to form an "advisory council on Haitian infrastructure" (which
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773048 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773048 Date: 08/31/2015
then could springboard to greater things and deeper commitments). If you could reach out to the appropriate person on
President Clinton's staff, we of course would be available to assist in giving shape to the concept, compiling a list of
names of infrastructure CEOs, etc.
2. On a much more personal note, two friends of Isabella and mine, were in the final B6
stages of adopting two infants out of a Haitian orphanage when the earthquake struck. Since that time, the process has
obviously stopped and they have had no word on the fate of these two babies, their welfare or the prospects for getting
them out of their earthquake-ravaged environment into their new home and family in the United States. I have attached
a significant amount of detail about the babies, the orphanage, etc.
Burns, I know President Clinton is devoting all of his herculean energy to humanitarian relief for Haiti at the macro level,
but knowing his humanistic approach, there must be someone on his staff who can help with these t •e of individual
situations. Is it possible for you to find that person so that I can make the request and so our friend can
provide him/her with any additional information that they might need?
I really appreciate your assistance with respect to both of these matters. Please do not hesitate to contact me night or
day on my cell phone
Come visit us in Princeton.
Best regards,
David Crane

Hi -- you guys are doing great work.
Wanted to let you know that we've sent a dozen members -- nurses, paramedics and trauma specialists to Haiti. They
are working with Paul Farmer's Partners in Health. This is the first deployment of 74 members who have volunteered in
Vermont. The work and being helpful is so important to them and to us. A number of people on our staff worked
throughout the weekend to make all the necessary arrangements, but the impetus came directly from our members.
As you know the challenges are enormous, but we have a long-term commitment to the reconstruction of the health
and education sectors in Haiti. Please let us know how we can be helpful.
Hope you're well.

<http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/>
A momentous 40 hours, leading to Clinton/China/Internet
21 Jan 2010 04:12 pm
Apart from two obvious pieces of momentous news in the past day-and-a-half -- the new junior Senator from
Massachusetts, and the new Buckley v. Valeo <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckley_v._Valeo> (by which I mean
today's lamentable, straight-party-line Supreme Court ruling
<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703699204575016942930090152.html> that removes limits from
direct corporate underwriting of political campaigns) -- there is one other event today that will have big ripple effects. I
mean SecState Hillary Clinton's speech this morning about "Internet Freedom," mentioned here
<http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2010/01/hillary_clintons_internetfree.php> and with a prelude
discussion here <http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2010/01/interesting_chinagoogle_discus.php> .
I'm not going to take time for a thorough gloss of the speech. Instead I highly recommend reading the full text, here
<http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/01/135519.htm>, or watching the official video, here
<http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid1705667530?bctid=62730021001> . And for now some of the main
points while listening (and noting main points down in real time with the handy LiveScribe

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773054 Date: 08/31/2015
- In contrast to the dreamy Internet optimism of a decade or so ago -- I'm not naming names, but I remember! -- when
many people imagined that info technology, by itself, would undermine oppression and bring the world together,
Clinton started off with a very astringent reminder that this technology, like others, was neither good or bad in itself and
is already being used in both helpful and destructive ways:
"Amid this unprecedented surge in connectivity, we must also recognize that these technologies are not an
unmitigated blessing. These tools are also being exploited to undermine human progress and political rights. Just as steel
can be used to build hospitals or machine guns, or nuclear power can either energize a city or destroy it, modern
information networks and the technologies they support can be harnessed for good or for ill. The same networks that
help organize movements for freedom also enable al-Qaida to spew hatred and incite violence against the innocent. And
technologies with the potential to open up access to government and promote transparency can also be hijacked by
governments to crush dissent and deny human rights."
And a very nice pivot out of this section, effective because it's so blunt and plain:
"On their own, new technologies do not take sides in the struggle for freedom and progress, but the United
States does."
- Underscoring the "this is a big deal" tone of the speech, she enumerated the "Four Freedoms
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Freedoms> "that FDR proclaimed in 1941, as part of the struggle for the world's
future, and said there were a comparable set of Four Freedoms for the Internet age. Check out the speech yourself for
details.
- The China surprise: the speech was a More frontal challenge to Chinese internet and overall censorship policy than I
expected, and than I recall in other US-China interactions in a very long time. For instance, early in the speech, an
itemization of the places where suppression is getting worse:
"In the last year, we've seen a spike in threats to the free flow of information. China, Tunisia, and Uzbekistan
have stepped up their censorship of the internet. In Vietnam, access to popular social networking sites has suddenly
disappeared. And last Friday in Egypt, 30 bloggers and activists were detained."
Tunisia, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Egypt -- this is not the grouping of countries that the Chinese government, in its recent
sense of rise to superpower status, is used to being lumped with. Compared to the US as a financial power, OK;
overtaking Japan in economic size, yes; being a crucial player in environmental negotiations... all that is one thing.
Bracketed in the same sentence with Tunisia and Uzbekistan is different. Sentences like this don't appear in formal, big-
deal SecState addresses by accident.
Other passages to the same effect:
"As I speak to you today, government censors somewhere are working furiously to erase my words from the
records of history. But history itself has already condemned these tactics....
"Those who disrupt the free flow of information in our society or any other pose a threat to our economy, our
government, and our civil society. Countries or individuals that engage in cyber attacks should face consequences and
international condemnation...."

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773054 Date: 08/31/2015
And then the Google section itself.
I had wondered whether the speech would mention Google by name -- and had reason to think it might not. (Main
argument for leaving it implicit rather than referring directly to the Google case: in the company's ongoing efforts to find
a "win-win-win <http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2010/01/behind_on_google-china-ology.php> "
acceptable way to remain in China, rather than a lose-lose-lose permanent split, it's not necessarily a help to have the
U.S. government standing officially by its side. ) But the way Sec. Clinton introduced the point was significant: as a proxy
for China's own ability to fulfill its potential
<http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2010/01/about_the_stakes_for_china_in.php> and sustain its economic
rise:
"To use market terminology, a publicly listed company in Tunisia or Vietnam that operates in an environment of
censorship will always trade at a discount relative to an identical firm in a free society. If corporate decision makers
don't have access to global sources of news and information, investors will have less confidence in their decisions over
the long term. Countries that censor news and information must recognize that from an economic standpoint, there is
no distinction between censoring political speech and commercial speech. If businesses in your nations are denied
access to either type of information, it will inevitably impact on growth.
"Increasingly, U.S. companies are making the issue of internet and information freedom a greater consideration
in their business decisions. I hope that their competitors and foreign governments will pay close attention to this trend.
The most recent situation involving Google has attracted a great deal of interest. And we look to the Chinese authorities
to conduct a thorough review of the cyber intrusions that led Google to make its announcement. And we also look for
that investigation and its results to be transparent.
"The internet has already been a source of tremendous progress in China, and it is fabulous. There are so many
people in China now online. But countries that restrict free access to information or violate the basic rights of internet
users risk walling themselves off from the progress of the next century. Now, the United States and China have different
views on this issue, and we intend to address those differences candidly and consistently in the context of our positive,
cooperative, and comprehensive relationship."
There's a lot more in the speech, including about terrorism, disaster relief, religion, etc -- but it's there for the reading.
Back to the to-do list for me now.

Dear Hillary
Wanted to take a minute to thank you for what you have down. I am sure preident Clinton and Chelsea told you what is
happening at the hospital.
It was deserted when we arrived except for 1500 patients and a few administrators. Now it is starting to function. We
have done over 100 operations and each day is better. The military is working with is
now to provide food water supplies support. They are amazing. Thank
you thank you thank you. Blessings on you and your family. Will
share more when I get real Internet access. To learn more see my posts on Huffington post.

Statement from Cecile Richards on International
Family Planning in the Obama Administration Budget
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773066 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773066 Date: 08/31/2015
WASHINGTON, DC —The women of the world have true friends in Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and the
Obama administration. After years of inadequate funding during the previous administration, yesterday's Fiscal Year
2011 budget request for an increase in international family planning is a critical step forward in demonstrating our
nation's renewed commitment to ensuring that women worldwide have access to safe and effective reproductive health
care.
The Obama administration has sent a strong signal that the status quo is unacceptable. Every year more than half a
million women — nearly all of whom live in developing countries — die of pregnancy-related causes. Moreover, one in
three deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth could be avoided if women who wanted effective contraception had
access to it.
To strengthen our working relationships with partners around the world, as well as our image, the United States must
increase access to family planning. By ensuring that women have increased access to the family planning they need, our
nation is working to make good on its commitment to promote the health of all women and their families.
An investment in family planning is an investment that reaps significant dividends. By providing education, counseling
and contraceptives to women and couples, we are working to strengthen families worldwide. We also will help achieve
major reductions in infant and maternal mortality, HIV infections and global poverty. As Secretary Clinton has said,
"There's a direct connection between a woman's ability to plan her family, space her pregnancies, and give birth safely,
and her ability to get an education, work outside the home, support her family, and participate fully in the life of her
community."
Planned Parenthood works with partners across the globe to eliminate barriers to basic reproductive health care that is
essential to the health and well-being of women, men and children everywhere. Limited access to health care, lack of
political will, legal and regulatory restrictions, cultural taboos, and harsh gender inequality all put women at risk of
unintended pregnancy, unsafe abortion and childbirth, and HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. The
commitment of Secretary Clinton and the Obama administration to international family planning will further the efforts
of Planned Parenthood and others to help women overcome barriers to accessing needed reproductive health care.
As the Fiscal Year 2011 budget and appropriations process moves forward, we look forward to working with Congress to
build on this request so that we may adequately address the global health challenges facing women worldwide.

Planned Parenthood Federation of America is the nation's leading sexual and reproductive health care provider and
advocate. We believe that everyone has the right to choose when or whether to have a child, and that every child
should be wanted and loved. Planned Parenthood affiliates operate more than 840 health centers nationwide, providing

worldwide to ensure that all women and men have the right and the means to meet their sexual and reproductive

Quite an interesting reply to my fanmail to the blogger I've been copying to you.
Hello Coco,Thank you for your kind words and sorry for the late reply -- I've been busy with the holiday season (also why
there's been a drop-off in posts Iately),I wouldn't place an extra emphasis on Haji's arrest (or on anyone at Baran, for
that matter). I think those arrests were geared at intimidating Khatami more than anything. Although he's been more
quiet than either Mousavi or Karoubi, he has "international clout," if you will, so I believe the regime is less willing to
attack him head-on. (Though what we witnessed on Tasooa was admittedly shocking). Actually, with a few exceptions, I
think a threshold has been passed where arrests aren't even strategic anymore. It seems that the vast majority are for
the sake of intimidation. The regime is looking increasingly desperate.Rafsanjani, I'm sure, is up to something. He's a
good ally, but I think the pro-democracy movement should always be wary of his intentions. Ultimately, Rafsanjani is
looking out for Rafsanjani. Having said that, I think his interests and those of the Greens have and will continue to
coalesce. Before the election, this was him funding Mousavi's campaign (in hopes that Mousavi's presidency would bring
him back into the fold after the rise of the "new right"). Now (and going forward), he's probably more concerned about
his legacy in Iran. We should remember he was the driving force that ascended Khamenei to the Supreme Leadership,
and that there were also accusations that the 2005 election (where he lost to Ahmadinejad) was fixed. Not to simplify
things, but I'm sure there is some resentment. Regardless, sooner or later he's going to have to be more bold and give
the opposition something (namely momentum, as he did with his July sermon) if he wants to get something back (clout,
legacy, etc.).Things are continuing to heat up! God-willing, change will come in 2010. Whether such a change is
ultimately 'regime change' should be up to the Iranian people inside Iran.Best Sent using BlackBerry® from

I've always wanted to go to Qom, and Iran too admittedly, as you know, more for the far history than recent I confess. I
can't sort out whether I want to go more or less now though because of recent turmoil/promise/discontent; maybe
want and sense are merely opposing forces! If only I could find an approproate Jane Austen quote...

A bit of arcana = but important.
http://www.payvand.com/news/10/jan/1008.html
The Society of Qom Seminary Teachers has disqualified Ayatollah Sanei as a Marja-e Taqhlid (source of emulation - high
clerical rank). Ayatollah Sanei, second to Montazeri, was the most outspoken critic of the election and subsequent
repression in Qom - he's also a very popular cleric in Iran and many of Montazeri's supporters were shifting to him. Iran
suppresses any figures about the support these clerics have, but we're talking millions.
The Society's power to disqualify Sanei is pretty questionable and it's a provocative act - all you need in Shiism to
become a Marja-e Taghlid is the faith of followers and confirmation of "two fair and knowledgeable individuals" and this
move is the latest in a decade long move by Khamenei to shift the clergy's power and authority away from their
constituency of followers and towards the government (increasing the clergy's dependence on the state for funds has
been the primary tool of reform.) Since Ashura the silence from Qom has been notable and this disqualification will split
the clergy further into those who side with the government and those who bet on popular support for their long term
influence. This last group are increasingly being forced to show their hand and incur punishment/risk assassination of
themselves or family members (cf Mousavi's nephew.)
Predictably, harder line clerics like Ayatollah Hussein Nouri Hamedani and former Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Mohammad
Yazdi have sided with Khamenei and the Rev Guard, as has Larijani (a key move by a smart betting man), but the
majority remain on the fence - and the next few weeks that include the mourning rituals for Ayatollah Montazeri, the
Ashura Martyrs, Arbein (40 days after Ashura) and the Anniversary of the Revolution on 2nd February will be events to
watch. Each of them are mass public rituals that have underpinned the Islamic Revolution for 30 years, and canceling
them would indicate extraordinary weakness by the government. They are obvious opportunities for the Green
Movement to mobilize, risk death and continue the cycle; the government knows it doesn't have the training or self
control to contain them peacefully and must be scratching their heads over how to stop this cycle. Forcing Revolutionary
Guard officers to shoot civilians is also a very risky move.
The ultimate fence sitter, and key figure behind Mousavi and Karroubi is of course Rafsanjani - who came out in veiled
support of the government, and it's supporters on Saturday, 2nd Jan. This support either cost Khamenei something, or
the Revolutionary Guard and he found leverage with the Shark. All a bit murky. Rafsanjani's clearly hedging his bets and
may feel that he would do best out of a negotiated National Unity Plan.

I still think the Western Press is optimistic about Khamenei and the Revolutionary Guard's weakness - but moves like
that against Montazeri and Sanei, and inflation running unofficially at 25% (confirmed by furious down town Tehran
friends quoting tomato prices) may finally push a broader tranche of society to join what has been a middle class protest
until now. The big problem with the 'protest' is that it doesn't have a credible leader, or stated ideals, but it's certainly
terrified those in power.
Predictions are for nutters in this situation, but I would doubt that Khamenei has the stomach for civil war, and there
must be some deals cooking. It's a tricky one for the West over who to support - because no deal will be clean.

Importance: High
Hi Cheryl:
Today, I was able to have good preliminary conversations with Jean Bonilla and Lorraine Hariton in EEB. Both Jean and
Lorraine are very excited about the opportunity to partner on this new area for the Secretary and provided me with
some very valuable insight and discussion on how we can partner and collaborate on programming and initiatives
together.

I also included the information from ECA — that we discussed in the document. The INR meeting was cancelled today and
will be scheduled for early next week. As I move around the Department and talk with other officials in the coming
week, I believe we will be able to build out a more robust Work Plan and garner some great collaborations on this
effort.
Additionally, in a recent conversation that I had with Governor O'Malley from Maryland, I shared with him that the
Secretary was launching a new effort that would assist state and local leaders with respect to their global affairs
portfolios. The Governor was extremely excited and remarked that he has some great idea for the Secretary about how
the Department can be a major value-add to local governments. He told me that he wants to be very engaged in what
we do in the Department in this area. I will be scheduling a time to meet with him and his economic team once my
position has been announced. He wanted me to let her know that he had been thinking about her and wanted to reach
out and did not know how and then I walked in and we began to have this discussion and he said — what a way to start
his year for 2010 — something coming to reality that he had been thinking about.
Also, Maura Pally in ECA forwarded me a meeting that I took with the Deputy Director of the National Lieutenant
Governor's Association. They were in town working on their upcoming Washington meeting. They too are very excited
about what we are planning and want to work very closely with us in the coming months as we launch this effort. Lt.
Governor Bill Bolling in VA is the current Chair.
Please let me know if you need to make any additional changes. Thanks so much for all of your assistance and
support!!!
Have a great New Years!!
Best,
Reta

Morales blasted the U.S. efforts in Haiti today. See below. Craig Kelly and I agree that you should consider a call to
Morales. Perhaps we could discuss tomorrow.

Rough translation of the points below:
Evo Morales announced today that his government will ask for an emergency meeting at the UN to "reject the U.S.
military occupation" in Haiti, according to Spanish news agency EFE.
"It is not possible that the U.S. is using a natural disaster to invade and occupy Haiti," said Morales, who qualified
as "inhumane, savage, and opportunist" the deployment of troops in the Caribbean island.
"We'll ask the UN, via our Foreign Ministry, for an emergency meeting to reject this military occupation of the U.S.
in Haiti," announced Morales.
Morales recalled that President Obama has guaranteed in international fora that he wants partners and respectful
diplomatic relations with other countries. "You don't achieve this (partners, diplomatic relations) with military
occupation, or troops, or bases," he said and expects "a pronouncement by the peoples of the world and social forces
rejecting this intervention and military occupation in Haiti."
Morales also asked "how much money, food and water" will be destined to the 12,000 soldiers the U.S. sent to
Haiti and noted that this money "should be spend on the victims."

EVO MORALES PIDE REUNION DE EMERGENCIA PARA REPUDIAR Y RECHAZAR A EEUU EN HAITI, INFORMA EFE
Evo Morales anunciO hoy que su Gobierno pedira a Naciones Unidas una reunion de emergencia para "repudiar y
rechazar la ocupacion militar de Estados Unidos" en Haiti, informa la agencia espariola EFE.
"No es posible que Estados Unidos use una desgracia natural para invadir y ocupar militarmente Haiti", dijo
Morales, quien califico de "inhumano, salvaje y oportunista" el despliegue de las fuerzas armadas estadounidenses en la
isla caribefia.
"Vamos a pedir mediante la cancilleria a las Naciones Unidas una reunion de emergencia para repudiar y rechazar
esta ocupaciOn militar de Estados Unidos hacia Haiti", anuncio Morales.
Morales recordo que el mandatario de Estados Unidos, Barack Obama, ha garantizado en foros internacionales que
desea tener socios y relaciones diplomaticas de respeto mutuo con el resto de 'Daises. "Ser socios o tener relaciones
diplomaticas no se hace con ocupacion militar, ni con tropas militares, ni con bases militares", dijo y espera "un
pronunciamiento de todos los pueblos del mundo y de las fuerzas sociales rechazando esta intervention y ocupaciOn
militar en Haiti".
Morales se preguntO tambien "cuanta plata, cuantos alimentos o cuanta agua" se van a destinar para abastecer a
los 12.000 soldados que Estados Unidos ha mandado a Haiti y considero que ese dinero "deberia gastarse en los
damnificados" por el terremoto y no en los militares.
• Confio en que el propio pueblo estadounidense rechace "el use abusivo" de sus recursos econornicos para lo que
insistio en calificar como "intervenciOn militar".

Dearest Cheryl -
You are so good at what you do. I was reminded of it this morning when I heard you on NPR. You're the perfect person
to be on the ground dealing with the operation and also translating for the public what is going on. I know you don't
enjoy doing press, but you are very good at it and I think it is important for the American public to understand the
mission of the U.S. government and the high respect and deference you are giving to the Haitian government. You really
got that across this morning.
Sending you lots of love and good luck in your incredibly important mission.
xo,
Ann

Apart from two obvious pieces of momentous news in the past day-and-a-half -- the new junior Senator from
Massachusetts, and the new Buckley v. Valeo <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckley_v._Valeo> (by which I mean
today's lamentable, straight-party-line Supreme Court ruling

mean SecState Hillary Clinton's speech this morning about "Internet Freedom," mentioned here
<http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2010/01/hillary_clintons_internet_free.php> and with a prelude
discussion here <http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2010/01/interesting_chinagoogle_discus.php> .
I'm not going to take time for a thorough gloss of the speech. Instead I highly recommend reading the full text, here

- In contrast to the dreamy Internet optimism of a decade or so ago -- I'm not naming names, but I remember! -- when
many people imagined that info technology, by itself, would undermine oppression and bring the world together,
Clinton started off with a very astringent reminder that this technology, like others, was neither good or bad in itself and
is already being used in both helpful and destructive ways:
"Amid this unprecedented surge in connectivity, we must also recognize that these technologies are not an
unmitigated blessing. These tools are also being exploited to undermine human progress and political rights. Just as steel
can be used to build hospitals or machine guns, or nuclear power can either energize a city or destroy it, modern
information networks and the technologies they support can be harnessed for good or for ill. The same networks that
help organize movements for freedom also enable al-Qaida to spew hatred and incite violence against the innocent. And
technologies with the potential to open up access to government and promote transparency can also be hijacked by
governments to crush dissent and deny human rights."
And a very nice pivot out of this section, effective because it's so blunt and plain:
"On their own, new technologies do not take sides in the struggle for freedom and progress, but the United
States does."
- Underscoring the "this is a big deal" tone of the speech, she enumerated the "Four Freedoms
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Freedoms> " that FDR proclaimed in 1941, as part of the struggle for the world's
future, and said there were a comparable set of Four Freedoms for the Internet age. Check out the speech yourself for
details.
- The China surprise: the speech was a more frontal challenge to Chinese Internet and overall censorship policy than I
expected, and than I recall in other US-China interactions in a very long time. For instance, early in the speech, an
itemization of the places where suppression is getting worse:
"In the last year, we've seen a spike in threats to the free flow of information. China, Tunisia, and Uzbekistan
have stepped up their censorship of the internet. In Vietnam, access to popular social networking sites has suddenly
disappeared. And last Friday in Egypt, 30 bloggers and activists were detained."
Tunisia, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Egypt -- this is not the grouping of countries that the Chinese government, in its recent
sense of rise to superpower status, is used to being lumped with. Compared to the US as a financial power, OK;
overtaking Japan in economic size, yes; being a crucial player in environmental negotiations... all that is one thing.
Bracketed in the same sentence with Tunisia and Uzbekistan is different. Sentences like this don't appear in formal, big-
deal SecState addresses by accident.
Other passages to the same effect:
"As I speak to you today, government censors somewhere are working furiously to erase my words from the
records of history. But history itself has already condemned these tactics....
"Those who disrupt the free flow of information in our society or any other pose a threat to our economy, our
government, and our civil society. Countries or individuals that engage in cyber attacks should face consequences and
international condemnation...."

And then the Google section itself.
I had wondered whether the speech would mention Google by name -- and had reason to think it might not. (Main
argument for leaving it implicit rather than referring directly to the Google case: in the company's ongoing efforts to find
a "win-win-win <http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2010/01/behind_on_google-china-ology.php> "
acceptable way to remain in China, rather than a lose-lose-lose permanent split, it's not necessarily a help to have the
U.S. government standing officially by its side. ) But the way Sec. Clinton introduced the point was significant: as a proxy
for China's own ability to fulfill its potential
<http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2010/01/about_the_stakes_for_china_in.php> and sustain its economic
rise:
"To use market terminology, a publicly listed company in Tunisia or Vietnam that operates in an environment of
censorship will always trade at a discount relative to an identical firm in a free society. If corporate decision makers
don't have access to global sources of news and information, investors will have less confidence in their decisions over
the long term. Countries that censor news and information must recognize that from an economic standpoint, there is
no distinction between censoring political speech and commercial speech. If businesses in your nations are denied
access to either type of information, it will inevitably impact on growth.
"Increasingly, U.S. companies are making the issue of internet and information freedom a greater consideration
in their business decisions. I hope that their competitors and foreign governments will pay close attention to this trend.
The most recent situation involving Google has attracted a great deal of interest. And we look to the Chinese authorities
to conduct a thorough review of the cyber intrusions that led Google to make its announcement. And we also look for
that investigation and its results to be transparent.
"The internet has already been a source of tremendous progress in China, and it is fabulous. There are so many
people in China now online. But countries that restrict free access to information or violate the basic rights of internet
users risk walling themselves off from the progress of the next century. Now, the United States and China have different
views on this issue, and we intend to address those differences candidly and consistently in the context of our positive,
cooperative, and comprehensive relationship."
There's a lot more in the speech, including about terrorism, disaster relief, religion, etc -- but it's there for the reading.
Back to the to-do list for me now.

Subject: Griot education project in Haiti - anothter idea -- much quicker ramp-up
Cheryl:
After watching scenes on TV, talking w/ you and others, here is idea for nearly immediate way to get kids back 'in school'
or into school for the first time. It would be very cheap, could get started very soon—say mid-February, could be linked
to other distribution networks (food/medical supplies), and would be quite organic and grassroots. I'll call it the Griot
education project (in the west African tradition of a streetside storytellers).
Context/Understanding:
Looks like there are a few hundred thousand kids in Port-au-Prince who pretty soon will be (already are) sitting around
day-to-day wi more or less nothing to do. Their schools got destroyed, their neighborhoods in rough shape. These are
young kids who would be best served if they could get out of the house for a few hours a day (possibly even freeing up
parents to do rebuilding or other work), and not spend their time getting caught up in crime, or desperately searching
through rubble for a mal to eat...and get back to school, and engage their naturally curious brains.
The goal of this program is to immediately give them a place to go, a chance to interface with an energetic educator, and
at least expose them to relevant, skill-enhancing academic work that engages them while we rebuild education
infrastructure. It also would likely get them 1 meal each day, and if needed a way to get referred for immediate medical
attention.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773156 Date: 08/31/2015
Griot Educators:
We recruit and equip a cadre of teachers who will go out into communities with a set of portable materials each
morning—educators who after a few days will find a place to teach, and will have attracted class of students. This is
modeled off the street artist/storyteller.
We flyer the neighborhoods, advertising teaching positions. We work w/ whoever we can find who can help us identify
people who were good teachers prior to the earthquake and/or people who have the abilty to attract kids
(appropriately).
We select teachers. We agree to pay them a daily/weekly stipend. We want people who know their communities, who
don't need a lot of direction, who will take a cart full of educational materials, find a corner, or abandoned building and
start teaching to whoever shows up. People who will do anything to get some young kids to try to read or do some math
problems or sing songs and write poetry...
Education Supply Centers
We set up education supply centers and a distribution system. Each center is staffed by small team-1 lead person is an
education-leader, others are admin and support. Griots come the center in the morning, they get a day's worth of
educational materials (we select it, we photocopy it, we give them 50 pencils, etc.). We agree to send over 50 meals
two hours later. Each Griot wheels his portable classroom to his/her spot and sets up shop...Kids come, and he/she
teaches. It builds momentum and kids get off the streets, out of their homes and come to the morning 'school' site.
Kids who come get a meal. Maybe we end up w/ 3 tiers of Griots-1 who works w/ 4, 5, 6 year olds, 1 with 7, 8, 9 year
olds, 1 with 10, 11, 12 year olds. Each one picks up a packet of material that is more or less appropriate for that age
group. All this is incredibly flexible and fluid. Maybe one morning session and then an after lunch session.
The education supply centers are warehouses we set up. They have copiers, lots of paper, basic school supplies, some
art supplies, etc. (Over time, maybe people donate a bunch of books or magazines, etc—they become ways for artists,
volunteers, entertainers to connect w/ kids, as well.) Each morning a group of Griots go to their supply centers and pick
up materials, and fill up their cart...and roll down the block, or blocks and set up their 'school' for the day. Maybe
someone wants to donate a bunch of art supplies, or harmonicas—who knows—whatever it takes to get kids to show
up and do some academic and enrichment activities. These education supply centers likely get linked to other
distribution hubs. This way they can get linked w/ food or other supplies.
Longer-term/setting the stage for longer-term ramp up
Over time, some of the Griots will end up running little schools that start to feel permanent. Kids will bring in chairs and
stools...maybe some of the teaching material ends up staying at the school sites, and the end up as likely places for folks
to build/rebuild schools. But in the near term, the 'school' is whatever spot the Griot goes to where he/she can attract a
cadre of kids—and the good news is that can be almost anywhere.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773156 Date: 08/31/2015
This program is cheap -- as costly as it is to pay stipends to the Griots, plus the cost of supplies, delivery, and some
human capital to man the supply centers, develop/acquire high interest, high educational value material. I think quite
cheap, and could easily be costed out once we knew about how much we need to pay a Griot for a day of teaching.
It also gets some folks working, immediately.
Some Griots would take stipend and not teach; some wouldn't do it well; some would pawn off the food/biscuits...But
we could weed much of that out and w/ this sort of approach, you don't let a few bad apples spoil the larger program
(or fear of them stop it from getting started). This program is about planting the seeds for the future schools to come,
about getting young kids off streets and stoops and into a fun/learning environment, about empowering talented
teacher-artists to go out into their communities armed w/ some basic materials, their good will, their creativity (and a
paycheck)—together the kids and the Griots will find local places to call and claim as their schools.
And while this is going on, we have time to build out infrastructure (human capital, facilities, instructional/curricular
materials) for more robust ramp-up over time.
Per usual, feel free to ignore or pass on.

Dear Burns:
It has been some time since we spoke so I wanted to start by wishing you a happy new year and thanking you for your
assistance in placing our corporate contribution for Haiti Relief through the Clinton Foundation.
My hope is that you can further help me with two very different requests related to the Haitian tragedy:
1. After the tsunami devastated parts of Indonesia in 2004, I felt strongly that the CEOs of American
corporations involved in the planning, construction and operation of civil, energy, water and telecommunication
infrastructure should lead a charitable effort involving human as well as financial resources to develop an
implementation plan for the rebuilding of the country once the Red Cross, the Military and the other "first responders"
had stabilized the situation. I think the concept is even more relevant in 2010 with respect to Haiti which obviously is
much closer to the United States and has much less indigenous skills and resources of its own to apply to the rebuilding

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773163 Date: 08/31/2015
effort. Given President Clinton's normal powers of persuasion and his passion for improving Haiti even before the
earthquake (it was the only thing he wanted to talk about when Isabella and I met with him in November), he would
have little difficulty recruiting a group of appropriate CEOs to form an "advisory council on Haitian infrastructure" (which
then could springboard to greater things and deeper commitments). If you could reach out to the appropriate person on
President Clinton's staff, we of course would be available to assist in giving shape to the concept, compiling a list of
names of infrastructure CEOs, etc.
2. On a much more personal note,
Burns, I know President Clinton is devoting all of his herculean energy to humanitarian relief for Haiti at the macro level,
but knowing his humanistic approach, there must be someone on his staff who can help with these type of individual
situations.
I really appreciate your assistance with respect to both of these matters. Please do not hesitate to contact me night or
day on my cell phone
Come visit us in Princeton.
Best regards,
David Crane

Trafficking fears as Haiti children go missing

The UN has warned countries not to step up adoptions from Haiti in the wake of the disaster. (AFP: Matthew Marek
United Nations officials say children have gone missing from hospitals in Haiti since the devastating January 12
earthquake, raising fears of trafficking for adoption abroad.
"We have documented around 15 cases of children disappearing from hospitals and not with their own family at the
time," said UNICEF adviser Jean Luc Legrand.
"UNICEF has been working in Haiti for many years and we knew the problem with the trade of children in Haiti that
existed already beforehand.
"Unfortunately, many of these trade networks have links with the international adoption market."
The agency said it had warned countries during the past week not to step up adoptions from Haiti in the immediate
wake of the quake.

However several are fast-tracking adoption procedures already under way, including Belgium, Canada, France, Germany,
the Netherlands, Spain and the United States.
Mr Legrand said the situation was similar to the aftermath of the tsunami in Asia five years ago.
Trafficking networks were springing into action immediately after the disaster and taking advantage of the weakness of
local authorities and relief coordination "to kidnap children and get them out of the country".
Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said child enslavement and
trafficking in Haiti was "an existing problem and could easily emerge as a serious issue over the coming weeks and
months".
The UN mission in Haiti has stepped up surveillance of roads, UNICEF officials said.
Mr Legrand said there was separate but only anecdotal evidence of people taking children by road to the neighbouring
Dominican Republic and loading children on to planes.
"We have seen over the past years many children being taken out of the country without any legal procedure," he said.
"This is going on. This is happening now. We are starting to have the first evidence of that, this is unquestionable."
He was unable to give details on the 15 missing children or their condition or clearly connect the anecdotal observations
in Haiti's chaos with trafficking.
The cases were documented by social workers and by partner non-governmental organisations working for UNICEF in
hospitals.

The UN has warned countries not to step up adoptions from Haiti in the wake of the disaster. (AFP: Matthew Marek
United Nations officials say children have gone missing from hospitals in Haiti since the devastating January 12
earthquake, raising fears of trafficking for adoption abroad.
"We have documented around 15 cases of children disappearing from hospitals and not with their own family at the
time," said UNICEF adviser Jean Luc Legrand.

"UNICEF has been working in Haiti for many years and we knew the problem with the trade of 'children in Haiti that
existed already beforehand.
"Unfortunately, many of these trade networks have links with the international adoption market."
The agency said it had warned countries during the past week not to step up adoptions from Haiti in the immediate
wake of the quake.
However several are fast-tracking adoption procedures already under way, including Belgium, Canada, France, Germany,
the Netherlands, Spain and the United States.
Mr Legrand said the situation was similar to the aftermath of the tsunami in Asia five years ago.
Trafficking networks were springing into action immediately after the disaster and taking advantage of the weakness of
local authorities and relief coordination "to kidnap children and get them out of the country".
Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said child enslavement and
trafficking in Haiti was "an existing problem and could easily emerge as a serious issue over the coming weeks and
months".
The UN mission in Haiti has stepped up surveillance of roads, UNICEF officials said.
Mr Legrand said there was separate but only anecdotal evidence of people taking children by road to the neighbouring
Dominican Republic and loading children on to planes.
"We have seen over the past years many children being taken out of the country without any legal procedure," he said.
"This is going on. This is happening now. We are starting to have the first evidence of that, this is unquestionable."
He was unable to give details on the 15 missing children or their condition or clearly connect the anecdotal observations
in Haiti's chaos with trafficking.
The cases were documented by social workers and by partner non-governmental organisations working for UNICEF in
hospitals.

Hi hillary,
Below is a message from my friend kevin thanking me for your efforts and alerting
me to the letter that has or will find its way to you from the university president. I forward it to you in case you haven't
seen it, want to get out in front of it, or whatever. The fact that you were instinctively sensitive to this situation should
always be enough but, of course, with this type of loss, it never is. I hope all else is well, there has to be some good news
somewhere. Right? All the best, brian

Dear Brian,
I wanted to thank you again for
I read with interest today's article in the NY Times on how well the Obama Administration-State Dept is managing the
crisis and associated PR. I know this would be a wonderful opportunity to serve two causes and get some great PR as
well as put the minds of many families at ease if the Sate Department were to make a statement of support for "leaving
no stone unturned until all Americans lost in Haiti can be returned to their families". I have already reached out to
Senator Reid as well who had a liaison of his following up on search efforts. You will notice below the University is
making a plea to Secretary Clinton directly, she may or may not be, aware. Again, thank you for your time and if this can
be put in the proper hands it would so be appreciated. You have already done more than I would have expected; and, I
did not want anyone to be surprised if they had not heard of the University and the families making the plea to
Secretary Clinton.
Kind Regards,

hi kev...please take note and see if anything else can be done...
President Kevin M. Ross remarks from 5 p.m. press briefing
As we all know, the world suffered one of the greatest natural disasters in history last Tuesday. The 7.0
earthquake that was centered just outside Port-au-Prince imperiled the lives of all those in Haiti, including 14 members
of our Lynn University family who were there on a mission trip. All 14 were on site at the Hotel Montana when the
quake struck, and we have reason to believe that our four missing students and two faculty may be there still.
In the nine days since that tragedy, we have all been captivated by the stories of heroism, triumph, anguish and
loss that have followed in the wake of this earthquake. And every day, we rejoice for what good news has been
broadcast out of the country: the elderly woman rescued from beneath a crumbled cathedral; the child pulled alive and
almost completely well from a wrecked home. As the family members of our missing students and employees have said
in recent days, we have taken comfort in these reports, and celebrated them almost as if they were our own good news.
And for good reason. It is our good news. This tragedy is not a Lynn University tragedy alone. It does not affect
just us, our community members, and their families. It affects us all. It affects people from around the world. It affects
those that survived, and those that did not. And it impacts most severely those in Haiti itself—the people who call that
country home.
Our "Journey of Hope" students went to Haiti to deliver hope. Eight have returned. And six remain missing. We
still have hope— hope that a miracle is in the making. Hope that our six are found safe and sound. And hope that many

others too will be freed and reunited with loved ones around the world. That remains our most ardent wish here at Lynn
University.
But there is another hope we have. A different kind of hope. And it is that hope that I wish to express tonight.
We have hope that whatever the days ahead may bring, that we have the United States government's assurance that
every person lost in this tragedy will be returned to their loved ones.
I want this personally. I want this for the families of our missing students and faculty, and our more than three
dozen employees and eight students with family missing in the country. And I want it for the campus community I
serve— a community that will need to grieve as well.
This is needed for every grieving father, son, mother, daughter, friend and neighbor who is aching at this very
moment for a phone call. Whenever that phone call comes, I join the families of our missing six in demanding that such a
call contain news of the whereabouts of the missing. A missing family member, whether alive or dead, must be returned
to his or her loved ones.
Forces are mounting in defense against such a call. From the outset of this crisis my office has been served in
immeasurable ways by Senator George S. LeMieux and Congressman Ron Klein and their staffs in Florida and D.C. The
two have helped however they could to aid us in our search efforts. And tonight they are standing with us to ask
Secretary Clinton and others to ensure that all Americans missing and unaccounted for in Haiti be returned home.
This is the assurance our campus community — and the families of these missing loved ones — will require in the
days ahead. And many other American families will appreciate the same.. Tonight I have a letter already signed by
Senator LeMieux urging the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and the U.S. Agency for International
Development to continue "search and rescue efforts until the possibility of survival no longer exists" and to do
"everything within (their) power to ensure that every American known to be missing in Haiti is located and returned
home."
I am so thankful for the senator's support, and the support of Congressman Klein, who has also pledged to back
us in this push. We hope all of our elected officials will join us — including those in Massachusetts, Georgia, New Jersey
and New York, the home states of our four missing students. So many have already shown their support and concern.
But now, we need assurances. We need a commitment to returning the missing to their families. Only this will give the
families of the victims the peace they need to carry on.
We have been saying from the beginning how thankful we are for the prayers and support we have received
here at Lynn University. The outpouring of support has been incredible. Please continue to offer those prayers and cross
those fingers. We still believe in miracles. And we wish those same miracles upon all of you who are still uncertain at this
hour.
Thank you all. And God bless.

Statement from Cecile Richards on International
Family Planning in the Obama Administration Budget
WASHINGTON, DC —The women of the world have true friends in Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and the
Obama administration. After years of inadequate funding during the previous administration, yesterday's Fiscal Year
2011 budget request for an increase in international family planning is a critical step forward in demonstrating our
nation's renewed commitment to ensuring that women worldwide have access to safe and effective reproductive health
care.
The Obama administration has sent a strong signal that the status quo is unacceptable. Every year more than half a
million women — nearly all of whom live in developing countries — die of pregnancy-related causes. Moreover, one in
three deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth could be avoided if women who wanted effective contraception had
access to it.
To strengthen our working relationships with partners around the world, as well as our image, the United States must
increase access to family planning. By ensuring that women have increased access to the family planning they need, our
nation is working to make good on its commitment to promote the health of all women and their families.
An investment in family planning is an investment that reaps significant dividends. By providing education, counseling
and contraceptives to women and couples, we are working to strengthen families worldwide. We also will help achieve
major reductions in infant and maternal mortality, HIV infections and global poverty. As Secretary Clinton has said,
"There's a direct connection between a woman's ability to plan her family, space her pregnancies, and give birth safely,
and her ability to get an education, work outside the home, support her family, and participate fully in the life of her
cornmunity."
Planned Parenthood works with partners across the globe to eliminate barriers to basic reproductive health care that is
essential to the health and well-being of women, men and children everywhere. Limited access to health care, lack of
political will, legal and regulatory restrictions, cultural taboos, and harsh gender inequality all put women at risk of
unintended pregnancy, unsafe abortion and childbirth, and HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. The

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773199 Date: 08/31/2015
commitment of Secretary Clinton and the Obama administration to international family planning will further the efforts
of Planned Parenthood and others to help women overcome barriers to accessing needed reproductive health care.
As the Fiscal Year 2011 budget and appropriations process moves forward, we look forward to working with Congress to
build on this request so that we may adequately address the global health challenges facing women worldwide.
###
Planned Parenthood Federation of America is the nation's leading sexual and reproductive health care provider and
advocate. We believe that everyone has the right to choose when or whether to have a child, and that every child
should be wanted and loved. Planned Parenthood affiliates operate more than 840 health centers nationwide, providing
medical services and sexuality education for millions of women, men, and teenagers each year. We also work with allies
worldwide to ensure that all women and men have the right and the means to meet their sexual and reproductive
health care needs.

Citizens United Supreme Court ruling is more of what we love about the web. It's the kind of typical collective dissection
we have now come to expect but that never really existed before: serious, speculative; arcane, funny, brilliant, baked,
etc. The Sunlight Foundation blogging <http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/01/22/wait-can-foreign-companies-

new "corporation as full citizen-person" framework, drawing on blogging going on at Newsweek
<http://biog.newsweek.com/blogs/thegaggle/archive/2010/01/22/should-foreign-corporations-spend-money-on-u-s-
political-candidates.aspx> and the Center for Public Integrity <http://www.publicintegrity.org/articles/entry/1913/> .
"Looks like [the Court] might support allowing foreign companies to spend freely in elections in the United States. I
guess this would be the corporate globalization of the U.S. electoral system." So you gotta ask yourself: Who does Hugo
Chavez want for President?
Blumenthal excerpting the Center for Public Integrity:
<http://coloradoindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Picture-142.png>
The Center for Public Integrity looks at this closer and shows what kind of foreign influence we are looking at:
One prominent examples is CITGO Petroleum Company — once the American-born Cities Services
Company, but purchased in 1990 by the Venezuelan government-owned Petroieos de Venezuela S.A. The Citizens

United ruling could conceivably allowVenezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who has sharply criticized both of the past
two U.S. presidents, to spend government funds to defeat an American political candidate, just by having CITGO buy TV
ads bashing his target.
And it's not just Chavez. The Saudi government owns Houston's Saudi Refining Company and half of
Motive Enterprises. Lenovo, which bought IBM's PC assets in 2004, is partially owned by the Chinese government's
Chinese Academy of Sciences. And Singapore's APL Limited operates several U.S. port operations. A weakening of the
limit on corporate giving could mean China, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and any other country that owns companies that
operate in the U.S. could also have significant sway in American electioneering.
I really can't see Americans being too happy about this.
Dahlia Lithwick reported for Slate <http://www.slate.com/id/2242208/> from the Supreme Court as the opinions were
being read. She offered this aside:
While Stevens is reading the portion of his concurrence about the "cautious view of corporate power" held by
the framers, I see Justice Thomas chuckle softly.
Was it a disdainful chuckle at the impotence of his colleague? Was it merely a chuckle of disagreement, of good-natured
exasperation? Was it a chuckle at an anachronistic vision of the framers set beside today's modern corporate silicon and
steel behemoths? I doubt he was thinking about Hugo Chavez.

Subject: DUP
DUP has gone behind closed doors at Stormont and the smart money is on them emerging at some point supporting the
deal.
There was movement today on the ancillary issue of government support for the Presbyterian Mutual Society, a savings
and loan that lost a lot of money and whose investors didn't get the same financial crisis protections as those in other
institutions. DUP members are pointing to that as enough of a carrot to change their posture on the policing and justice
deal.
Brown and Cowen are poised to go to NI tomorrow. Will keep you posted.

This is from Justice Stevens' dissent in the Citizens United case:
!f taken seriously, our colleagues' assumption that the identity of a speaker has no relevance to the Government's ability
to regulate political speech would lead to some remarkable conclusions. Such an assumption would have accorded the
propaganda broadcasts to our troops by "Tokyo Rose" during World War Il the same protection as speech by Allied
commanders. More pertinently, it would appear to afford the same protection to multinational corporations controlled
by foreigners as to individual Americans: To do otherwise, after all, could " 'enhance the relative voice' " of some ( i.e. ,
humans) over others ( i.e. nonhumans). Ante , at 33 (quoting Buckley , 424 U. S., at 49). 51

Blogging on the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling is more of what we love
about the web. It's the kind of typical collective dissection we have now come
to expect but that never really existed before: serious, speculative, arcane,
funny, brilliant, baked, etc. The Sunlight Foundation blogging
<http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/01/22/wait-can-foreign-companies-now-spend-on-us-political-elections/>
is predictably good. Paul Blumenthal dips into the multinational dimension of
the new "corporation as full citizen-person" framework, drawing on blogging

"Looks like [the Court] might support allowing foreign companies to spend freely
in elections in the United States. I guess this would be the corporate
globalization of the U.S. electoral system." So you gotta ask yourself: Who does
Hugo Chavez want for President?
Blumenthal excerpting the Center for Public Integrity:
<httplicoloradoindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Picture-142.png>
The Center for Public Integrity looks at this closer and shows what kind of
foreign influence we are looking at:
One prominent examples is CITGO Petroleum Company — once the
American-born Cities Services Company, but purchased in 1990 by the Venezuelan
government-owned PetrOleos de Venezuela S.A. The Citizens United ruling could
conceivably allow Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who has sharply criticized
both of the past two U.S. presidents, to spend government funds to defeat an
American political candidate, just by having CITGO buy TV ads bashing his
target.
And it's not just Chavez. The Saudi government owns Houston's Saudi
Refining Company and half of Motiva Enterprises. Lenovo, which bought IBM's PC
assets in 2004, is partially owned by the Chinese government's Chinese Academy
of Sciences. And Singapore's APL Limited operates several U.S. port operations.
A weakening of the limit on corporate giving could mean China, Saudi Arabia,

Singapore, and any other country that owns companies that operate in the U.S.
could also have significant sway in American electioneering.
I really can't see Americans being too happy about this.
Dahlia Lithwick reported for Slate <http://www.slate.com/id/2242208/> from the
Supreme Court as the opinions were being read. She offered this aside:
While Stevens is reading the portion of his concurrence about the "cautious
view of corporate power" held by the framers, I see Justice Thomas chuckle
softly.
Was it a disdainful chuckle at the impotence of his colleague? Was it merely a
chuckle of disagreement, of good-natured exasperation? Was it a chuckle at an
anachronistic vision of the framers set beside today's modern corporate silicon
and steel behemoths? I doubt he was thinking about Hugo Chavez.

Blogging on the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling is more of what we love
about the web. It's the kind of typical collective dissection we have now come
to expect but that never really existed before: serious, speculative, arcane,
funny, brilliant, baked, etc. The Sunlight Foundation blogging

is predictably good. Paul Blumenthal dips into the multinational dimension of
the new "corporation as full citizen-person" framework, drawing on blogging
going on at Newsweek <http://blog.newsweek.com/blogs/thegaggle/archive/2010/01/22/should-foreign-corporations-
spend-money-on-u-s-political-candidates.aspx>
and the Center for Public Integrity <http://www.publicintegrity.org/articles/entry/1913/>
"Looks like [the Court] might support allowing foreign companies to spend freely
in elections in the United States. I guess this would be the corporate
globalization of the U.S. electoral system." So you gotta ask yourself: Who does c,
Hugo Chavez want for President?
Blumenthal excerpting the Center for Public Integrity:
<http://coloradoindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Picture-142.png>
The Center for Public Integrity looks at this closer and shows what kind of
foreign influence we are looking at:
One prominent examples is CITGO Petroleum Company — once the
American-born Cities Services Company, but purchased in 1990 by the Venezuelan
government-owned PetrOleos de Venezuela S.A. The Citizens United ruling could
conceivably allow Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who has sharply criticized
both of the past two U.S. presidents, to spend government funds to defeat an
American political candidate, just by having CITGO buy TV ads bashing his
target.
And it's not just Chavez. The Saudi government owns Houston's Saudi
Refining Company and half of Motiva Enterprises. Lenovo, which bought IBM's PC
assets in 2004, is partially owned by the Chinese government's Chinese Academy

of Sciences. And Singapore's APL Limited operates several U.S. port operations.
A weakening of the limit on corporate giving could mean China, Saudi Arabia,
Singapore, and any other country that owns companies that operate in the U.S.
could also have significant sway in American electioneering.
I really can't see Americans being too happy about this.
Dahlia Lithwick reported for Slate <http://www.slate.com/id/2242208/> from the
Supreme Court as the opinions were being read. She offered this'aside:
While Stevens is reading the portion of his concurrence about the "cautious
view of corporate power" held by the framers, I see Justice Thomas chuckle
softly.
Was it a disdainful chuckle at the impotence of his colleague? Was it merely a
chuckle of disagreement, of good-natured exasperation? Was it a chuckle at an
anachronistic vision of the framers set beside today's modern corporate silicon
and steel behemoths? I doubt he was thinking about Hugo Chavez.

Northern Ireland agrees power-sharing deal
Gordon Brown hails historic deal which will see justice and policing powers be devolved to Stormont from 12 April

Justice and policing powers will be devolved to Northern Ireland <http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/northernireland>'s
power-sharing government from 12 April in a historic deal agreed by the main parties that "opens a new chapter" after
decades of violence, Gordon Brown said today.
Standing alongside his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, at a press conference at Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast, the
prime minister said the "inspirational" agreement between Sinn Fein <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/sinn-fein>
and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/dup> was a foundation for lasting peace.
The deal — finally agreed to by the DUP <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/feb/05/northern-ireland-dup-ulster-
deal> last night and described as a final piece in the jigsaw after a long search for peace — comes after two weeks of
round-the-clock negotiations and brings an end to fears that the power-sharing government might collapse.
It will see policing and justice powers devolved from Westminster to the assembly within weeks and includes new plans
on overseeing parades.
Brown, who travelled to Belfast this morning, said the agreement had been possible because of "a new spirit of mutual
co-operation and respect".
The deal meets a key Sinn Fein demand and prevents the republican party from walking out of the power-sharing
executive. In return, the DUP has secured reforms to the way loyalist marches are handled in Northern Ireland, including
the abolition of the Parades Commission, a body most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773249 Date: 08/31/2015
A cross-community vote will now be held in the Stormont assembly on 9 March before the policing and justice powers
are devolved from London on 12 April.
Brown told reporters: "The achievements have been as great as they are inspirational. This moment and this agreement
belongs to the people of Northern Ireland, all of the people, and now more than ever before so does their future ... This
is the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years of
talks, weeks of stalemate."
Cowen praised both unionists and nationalists for making "fair and balanced compromises" to bridge the divisions and
said the quality of the negotiations meant that the "devolved institutions can and will work".
The Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, said the deal would further isolate republican dissidents who have
launched three separate gun and bomb attacks against police stations in the province over the last 10 days. The deal
would "absolutely" make Northern Ireland a safer place, he said.
The DUP leader, Peter Robinson, said the agreement "will be more enduring becauie of the time spent" in forming it.
Referring back to the Belfast Agreement of 1998 <http://www.nio.gov.uk/the-agreement> when negotiations bore fruit
at the 11th hour, the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, described the current deal and the'rescue of power-sharing as
"yet another very good Friday".
Jeffrey Donaldson told the Guardian the DUP's 36-strong assembly team was now unanimously in favour of the deal.
But the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) has yet to officially back the package which will allow the assembly to set up
legislation to change the way parades are judged.
A UUP spokeswoman said members wanted to see the proposed agreement before giving their response to the two
governments. "We have not had sight of this agreement and until we do we will not be signing up to it," she said.
The talks, which centred on Hillsborough Castle, outside Belfast, are the longest set of continuous negotiations held in
the near 20-year peace process. Sinn Fein had accused the DUP of stalling on the transfer of policing powers for the last
three years and it was feared that failure to find agreement could see the collapse of the power-sharing government led
by the two parties.
The agreement finally came near midnight at Stormont's parliament building. Earlier in the evening Sinn Fein had said
the basis of a deal was on the table and it was giving the DUP leadership the time to persuade its party to accept it.
Robinson emerged from a meeting of party colleagues to confirm that he had secured unanimous support for the
proposals. Earlier in the week up to 14 DUP assembly members had opposed a proposed deal because it did not give
unionists enough concessions.
Robinson said he would now look to gain the support of the community and the smaller assembly parties for the deal.
"We have a basis upon which we can go forward and recommend it [the deal] to our party, to the other parties in
Northern Ireland and to the community.
"An essential element of the Democratic Unionist Party's manifesto is the requirement for community confidence; we
believe this can be the basis for gaining that confidence."
However the leader of the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), Jim Allister, questioned why the 14 DUP rebels had
changed their minds.
"The deal hasn't changed, only the snowmen of the DUP, who melted once the heat came on," Allister said.
The DUP now faces a struggle to ward off the TUV threat in the forthcoming general election. Allister will portray the
deal as a sell-out of unionist principles and a sop to republicanism.

Justice and policing powers will be devolved to Northern Ireland <http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/northernireland>'s
power-sharing government from 12 April in a historic deal agreed by the main parties that "opens a new chapter" after
decades of violence, Gordon Brown said today.
Standing alongside his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, at a press conference at Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast, the
prime minister said the "inspirational" agreement between Sinn Fein <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/sinn-fein>
and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/dup> was a foundation for lasting peace.
The deal — finally agreed to by the DUP <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/feb/05/northern-ireland-dup-ulster-
deal> last night and described as a final piece in the jigsaw after a long search for peace — comes after two weeks of
round-the-clock negotiations and brings an end to fears that the power-sharing government might collapse.
It will see policing and justice powers devolved from Westminster to the assembly within weeks and includes new plans
on overseeing parades.
Brown, who travelled to Belfast this morning, said the agreement had been possible because of "a new spirit of mutual
co-operation and respect".
The deal meets a key Sinn Fein demand and prevents the republican party from walking out of the power-sharing
executive. In return, the DUP has secured reforms to the way loyalist marches are handled in Northern Ireland, including
the abolition of the Parades Commission, a body most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists.
A cross-community vote will now be held in the Stormont assembly on 9 March before the policing and justice powers
are devolved from London on 12 April.
Brown told reporters: "The achievements have been as great as they are inspirational. This moment and this agreement
belongs to the people of Northern Ireland, all of the people, and now more than ever before so does their future ... This
is the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years of
talks, weeks of stalemate."
Cowen praised both unionists and nationalists for making "fair and balanced compromises" to bridge the divisions and
said the quality of the negotiations meant that the "devolved institutions can and will work".
The Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, said the deal would further isolate republican dissidents who have
launched three separate gun and bomb attacks against police stations in the province over the last 10 days. The deal
would "absolutely" make Northern Ireland a safer place, he said.
The DUP leader, Peter Robinson, said the agreement "will be more enduring because of the time spent" in forming it.
Referring back to the Belfast Agreement of 1998 <http://www.nio.gov.uk/the-agreement> when negotiations bore fruit
at the 11th hour, the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, described the current deal and the rescue of power-sharing as
"yet another very good Friday".
Jeffrey Donaldson told the Guardian the DUP's 36-strong assembly team was now unanimously in favour of the deal.
But the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) has yet to officially back the package which will allow the assembly to set up
legislation to change the way parades are judged.
A UUP spokeswoman said members wanted to see the proposed agreement before giving their response to the two
governments. "We have not had sight of this agreement and until we do we will not be signing up to it," she said.
The talks, which centred on Hillsborough Castle, outside Belfast, are the longest set of continuous negotiations held in
the near 20-year peace process. Sinn Fein had accused the DUP of stalling on the transfer of policing powers for the last
three years and it was feared that failure to find agreement could see the collapse of the power-sharing government led
by the two parties.
The agreement finally came near midnight at Stormont's parliament building. Earlier in the evening Sinn Fein had said
the basis of a deal was on the table and it was giving the DUP leadership the time to persuade its party to accept it.
Robinson emerged from a meeting of party colleagues to confirm that he had secured unanimous support for the
proposals. Earlier in the week up to 14 DUP assembly members had opposed a proposed deal because it did not give
unionists enough concessions.
Robinson said he would now look to gain the support of the community and the smaller assembly parties for the deal.
"We have a basis upon which we can go forward and recommend it [the deal] to our party, to the other parties in
Northern Ireland and to the community.
"An essential element of the Democratic Unionist Party's manifesto is the requirement for community confidence; we
believe this can be the basis for gaining that confidence."
However the leader of the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), Jim Allister, questioned why the 14 DUP rebels had
changed their minds.

"The deal hasn't changed, only the snowmen of the DUP, who melted once the heat came on," Allister said.
The DUP now faces a struggle to ward off the TUV threat in the forthcoming general election. Allister will portray the
deal as a sell-out of unionist principles and a sop to republicanism.

FYI --
Reid: Shelby Has Hold On All Nominees
Friday, Feb. 5, 2010
Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., has placed a blanket hold on all executive nominations on the Senate calendar in an effort to
win concessions from the Obama administration and Pentagon on a variety of fronts affecting his home state, according
to aides to Senate Majority Leader Reid.
Reid spokeswoman Regan Lachapelle said Shelby is blocking more than 70 pending nominations. Reid can force a vote
on any nomination by filing cloture.
Because of the time required to vote on multiple nominations, the Senate processes most nominations by unanimous
consent. Any one senator can block any of those nominations by objecting to a unanimous consent request to take it up.
The nominations will remain stalled unless Reid files cloture.
While holds are frequent, Senate aides said a blanket hold represents a far more aggressive use of the power than is
normal.
"He should not be holding up 70-plus nominees for a parochial issue," a Democratic aide said. "They're qualified and
they should be moving forward."
Disclosure of the blanket hold came after two days in which top Democrats voiced mounting frustration with Republican
holds on executive nominees.
"We've got a huge backlog of folks who are unanimously viewed as well qualified -- nobody has a specific objection to
them -- but end up having a hold on them because of some completely unrelated piece of business," President Obama
said Wednesday in a televised meeting with Senate Democrats.
On the Senate floor Thursday, Reid, Senate Majority Whip Durbin, Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy and Senate
Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin ripped Republicans for holds on national security nominees and judges.

Reid, who kept the Senate in pro forma session over recent holidays to prevent former President George W. Bush from
making recess appointments, said he has grown so frustrated he might advocate such appointments, which the
president can make when the Senate is out of session.
"What alternatives do we have?" Reid said on the floor Thursday. "What alternative do we have?"
Earlier in the day, a spokesman for Shelby said the senator has placed holds on "several pending nominees due to
unaddressed national security concerns," including frustrations with the Air Force's handling of the competition for an
aerial refueling tanker. The spokesman did not respond to later requests for comment about the blanket hold.
Northrop Grumman Corp. and EADS, the European consortium behind Airbus, and Boeing Co. are vying for the high-
stakes contract, potentially worth $40 billion. The Northrop/EADS team would build the planes in Mobile, Ala., but has
threatened to pull out of the competition unless the Air Force makes changes to a draft request for proposals.
"Nearly 10 years after the U.S. Air Force announced plans to replace the aging tanker fleet, we still do not have a
transparent and fair acquisition process to move forward," the spokesman said. "The Department of Defense must
recognize that the draft request for proposal needs to be significantly and substantively changed."
Defense Secretary Gates Wednesday told House lawmakers the Pentagon plans to issue the final request for proposals
soon, and will proceed with the program whether or not there is a competition.
"Obviously we would like to have a competition for it, and we hope that both companies will agree to participate, but
we will move forward," Gates said. "We have to have new tankers."
In addition to the tanker issue, Shelby's spokesman said he is frustrated that the Oba ma administration won't build an
Alabama-based FBI center to analyze improvised explosive devices.
Shelby secured a $45 million earmark in the FY08 omnibus appropriations bill for a Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical
Center to be set up at the Army's Redstone Arsenal.
"Sen. Shelby will continue to work with the FBI to give them the capability to coordinate intelligence as well as forensic
and technical exploitation related to IEDs, but this administration's coddling of terrorists makes this an uphill effort," the
spokesman said. "He has made the administration aware of these concerns and is willing to discuss them at any time."
Also Thursday, Vice President Biden said he was so frustrated by Republican foot-dragging that he was considering
whether Senate rules should be changed.
"There's a little disappointment in that it seems like the only way to do business up here anymore is with a
supermajority on almost everything," Biden said moments after swearing in Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass., who gives
Republicans 41 votes, enough to filibuster on any issue.
"What I have been doing is spending a lot of time having my staff go back and scrub this, you know, the use of the
filibuster and how it's worked," Biden said. "This is not a constitutional requirement."
Biden defended the 60-vote requirement, calling it "a useful tool. It's legitimate, but from my perspective having served
here, having been elected seven times, I've never seen a time when it's become sort of standard operating procedure....
Requiring a supermajority is just not a good way to do business."

Re: New developments on NI
Shaun regrets he cannot come here tomorrow. Here's the problem and the plan: Cameron is still quietly giving
encouragement to the Ulster Unionists, which, led by Reg Empey, are trying to scuttle the agreement somehow. So the
plan is for Shaunn to announce he will deliver a speech on Monday in the House of Commons presenting the
agreement—except that at the last second Gordon will step in on the floor for Shaun, requiring Cameron to respond,
theoretically forcing him to support the agreement. In his speech, Gordon will explicitly cite your role and support of the
US—among other things further cornering Cameron (and Empey). Shaun would like to speak with you soon depending
on how things are working out there, perhaps tomorrow (Sunday) or perhaps Monday (perhaps after Commons). Dinner
will be on a rain-check.

human rights norms.
Our concerns are based on our commitment to universal respect for human rights. We are particularly concerned by the
potential for further violence and repression during the coming days, especially around the anniversary of the Islamic
Republic's founding on 11 February. We call on the Government of Iran to live up to its international human rights
obligations, to end its abuses against its own people, to hold accountable those who have committed the abuses and to
release those who are exercising their rights.

David Cameron will be given the right of reply after the PM's statement this afternoon -- followed by Q&A. UUP MP
Sylvia Hermon is likely to be "unhelpful" during the Q&A.
The Conservatives are becoming exasperated by the rumors that appear in the press and elsewhere that they are
unsupportive of the agreement. Our contacts say the Tories have been completely consistent in supporting the
government on devolution, though they don't believe HMG handled the issue well (i.e. allowing the exclusion of the UUP
and SDLP).
Reg Empey is scheduled to meet his MLAs tonight to review the document and prepare for the working group with
SDLP's Margaret Ritchie.

The plan worked perfectly. Gordon made the speech in the late afternoon. Cameron felt compelled to support both the
deal and the timing. Shaun called Lou Susman beforehand and Susman made a helpful call to Cameron "seeking
clarification" an hour and a half before the event.
Now, Reg Empey is boxed in. He's considering his position. It may be that you will have to call him in a couple days.
Shaun will call you tomorrow at a time convenient to you.

Subject: PM Bellerive on Donors' Conference, SOFA, adoptions, migrants, political dilema and more
I was in three meetings today with Prime Minister Jean Max Bellerive and he made the following points:
Donors' Confab: The GOH would like to hold the donors' pledging conference in New York on April 15. They have
discounted their original date (March 22-23) because there is an IDB meeting in Mexico City on those same dates. There
is a technical donors' meetings in Santo Domingo on April 14, and the GOH would like the pledging session to come after
it. Bellerive said the GOH would also be open to doing the pledging session on March 31, though they prefer April 15.
Status of Forces Agreement: Bellerive asked me if we could propose to the GOH a SOFA covering US troops in Haiti.
I told him we would consult and get back to him ASAP.

Adoptions: Bellerive signed the two lists of humanitarian parole letters I brought him, 1.4(B)
asking if we are close to finishing all the kids in the pipeline. In a later meeting with multiple donors Bellerive 1.4(D)
talked about the case of the ten Amcits being held for allegedly trying to take Haitian children out of the country withou B1
authorization. He said that this case is in the hands of the courts and that the Executive has no influence over the
outcome, but said it is an example of the GOH's need to control the problem of child trafficking which he said has
increased exponentially since the earthquake. He said the judge has three months to decide the case. He has already
dropped the most serious charge of kidnapping, and now the charges "only carry a maximum of 15 years in prison." He
said that the judge might determine that there isn't enough evidence in the case to try the Amcits. He said that the only

power the Executive has in the case would be a presidential pardon in the event they are found guilty. He would not
speculate on whether Preval would consider a pardon if the Amcits are found guilty.
Migrants: He approved the return to Haiti of 62 Haitian migrants detained on Great Exuma and said repatriations should
continue as pre-earthquake normal.
Relations with Dominican Republic: On instructions, I asked Bellerive in private what the GOH believed would be the
appropriate role of the Dominican Republic in donor coordination mechanisms.
Political dilemma: The executive decree establishing a state of urgency expires on February 15 and can only be
extended by Parliament. Parliament has been fiercely critical of the Preval/Bellerive government since the disaster, and
This leaves the
government with the dilemma of how to handle extraordinary disaster needs (such as declaring land of public utility)
after February 15. UN SRSG Mullet encouraged Bellerive to seek a "full consensus" with the opposition as "nothing
short of unanimity" would be required to address the enormous challenges Haiti is facing.
Bellerive told the donor community that the GOH may soon have to choose between
becoming totally ineffective (which he said they will not do) or taking actions that exceed the authority given to the
Executive by the law (which he implied they are prepared to do). The government is meeting with the private sector to
get their approval of theW reconstruction strategy, recognizing that they will have great difficulty getting a consensus
with the political parties. Bellerive said that the GOH is also evaluating what to do about upcoming elections and
constitutional reform, but implied that they have more time to reach a decision on these matters.
Preval to address the nation: The government is going to designate February 12 (the month anniversary of the quake) as
a day of national mourning and President Preval will make his first formal address to the nation since the disaster. They
are drafting his speech to be part mourning and part the vision of the future. Preval wants to announce that all the
ministries are up and running as usual.
Ministries: The PM said that the Primature and the Ministry of Planning will be moving into the old US Embassy building.
The courts will move into the old USAID building. The plan to move a number of the ministries out to Croix des
Bouquets has met with very little enthusiasm from the main line ministries. They prefer to clear the rubble off of their
properties in downtown Port-au-Prince and either build new buildings (EU is offering to finance) or put up temporary
structures (Canada is offering to finance).

General and specific concerns: Specifically heard from Haiti is that Preval has acceded too much authority to the Vorbe

Second, more general, is that the BAMBAM families (the term, I understand, created from the initials of the 6 leading
elite families) are gearing up to inflate costs of doing things and to try to monopolize to the extent they can. Will
forward in a separate email one or two articles I've seen on this.

Leslie - First, thank god you were in NYC on Jan 12th. I hope your personal losses were minimal.
Surely, Haiti has lost much. We all have...
Thoughts for Montreal:
1. This offers an opportunity to 'rebalance' Haiti.
2. Pay attention to the exodus from PAP and catch up with it. (The migration to PAP over the past 30
years was an unnatural development, spurred by rural neglect and urban concentration.)
3. A decentralized system of 'welcome centers' in town and villages can assist returnees re-integrate.
Medical and continuing education services should be a part of them. NEED TO ACT NOW.
4. More important, the centers must be equipped to provide work - make them the basis for organizing
the civic service corps. Higly decentralized: work for cash; public works/environmental restoration/food production;
restoration of human dignity; rural-urban partnerships through work;e in Haiti's real future. Also a chance to begin
repairing the social fabric. Will need a 'tough love' approach; disciplined management. Not the work for NGOs.
5. No investment in rural areas and no response to this opportunity will = back to the future re. crowded
PAP. People will trickle back to the city to replicate past problems.
6. The damage was done before the earthquake by development/investment policies that ignored the
rural areas; saw Haitians simply as sources of cheap labor; denigrated human dignity; failed to strengthen local
institutions.
7. This must stop; can't happen again.
8. This is the time to move forward with the Civic Service Corps - quickly.
kenbe. Pa lage. - Bob

I was deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Congressman Jack Murtha. From the battlefields of Vietnam to the hills
of Western Pennsylvania to the halls of Congress, Jack Murtha lived by the Marine Corps credo "Semper Fidelis," never
wavering in his faithful commitment to the country he loved and the men and women who bravely defend her. In war
and in peace, he fought for what he knew was right, even when it was unpopular. He was a fierce advocate for working
families struggling with a changing economy and for better health care and equipment for servicemembers. And over
the course of more than three decades in Congress, he became one of our nation's most respected voices on national
security and foreign policy. Presidents of both parties sought his advice and generations of colleagues looked to him for
leadership and wisdom. As Senator from New York serving on the Armed Services Committee, I was fortunate to call
Jack a friend and mentor. And as Secretary of State, I continued to rely on his expertise and judgment. I knew that Jack
would always shoot straight, like the Marine he was, and never shy away from a difficult question or a tough fight. Today
our country has lost a decorated war hero and a distinguished public servant. The men and women of the our armed
forces have lost a tireless champion. And the people of Pennsylvania's 12th district have lost a neighbor, an advocate,
and a true friend. My thoughts and prayers are with them and with Jack's beloved wife Joyce and their family. He will be
sorely missed.

Subject: Conversation with Bob Maguire
Cheryl,
I had a good conversation with Bob this afternoon. The major points he wanted to emphasize were the ones he had
included in his emails to you, including:
"Rebalancing" Haitian development: Redevelopment should occur nationwide and encourage a more even
distribution of the Haitian population. The international community should not rebuild Port-au-Prince at the expense of
the rest of the country. Bob thinks that nationwide rebuilding will also reduce the chances of elite capture of the
rebuilding effort, since elites are strongly concentrated in Port-au-Prince.
• Transparency: Bob is cautious about just throwing money at the problem. He thinks the international
community should establish a new norm of transparency in Haiti, for example, to ensure that there isn't widespread
corruption, price gauging, grants of monopolies, etc.
• Link the Haitian business community to other business communities: Bob thinks that if all the rebuilding is done
by the usual suspects in the Haitian business community, they'll simply build back the country they had before. He
recommends working to bring in foreign investors, and then linking foreign investors and leading Haitian businessmen
(e.g., in a business roundtable) to socialize better business practices in Haiti.
• On the issue of legal authorities for reconstruction: Bob recommends exploring whether presidential
commission-like structures could be empowered to resolve the legal problems likely to arise as barriers to
reconstruction.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773522 Date: 08/31/2015
• Duration of US presence: Bob cautioned that most Haitians would be happy to see a long-term US military
presence in the country, though this would likely have adverse reputational consequences in the hemisphere for the
United States. Given that hurricane season will begin in the fall, Bob recommends that when we do draw down, we
make clear that we will return if needed.
• Getting people to work: Bob argued that NGOs may not be the best vehicles for getting Haitians to work (e.g.,
through job training, etc.). In short, they're too nice. Many Haitians have never held a regular job, are unfamiliar with
showing up on time, etc. They'll need a bit of tough love and discipline. Bob though ex-military might set the right kind
of example.
• Diaspora: Engaging the diaspora is clearly important, but we do not want to support widespread repatriation of
the diaspora as NGO employees, reconstruction experts, etc., at the expense of Haitians who never left. This reinforces
wage differentials and social discontent about returnees.
• Conditional cash transfers: Bob thinks that conditional cash transfer programs have a lot of potential to improve
education and the delivery of health services in Haiti.

Dear Hillary,
I just arrived back but my heart and mind are back in Haiti I am thankful that you helped me get there and supported
the resurrection of the hospital in just one week. General Keen was key in reestablishing the hospital (and I got to
appreciate MRE's). When we got there there were 1500 patients and 400 corpses in a deserted hospital — our team of 7
was the only group there.... And slowly over the week we have built a functioning hospital again.
Meeting and working with Paul has been good for the soul---- although when I felt I wanted to meet him – this was not
the way...But I think I am in this for the long haul...
Below is an email for President Clinton (it was good to see him and Chelsea and Mark there) I promised to forward this
email by a medical student he spoke to in the operating room .... Desperate to find a way to continue his education.
Attached is picture of him and I in front of the surgery area. And there were 3 more I met a few nights later who had
volunteered since the first days but had not eaten in a week (I managed to gather bag of biscuits from the world food
program from behind 3 padlocks after 1 hours of searching – They slept on the hospital grounds because their homes
were destroyed.
I am not sure what we can do... But I promised to pass this on!
Thank you for who you are in the world.. God bless you!
Your friend in gratitude,
Mark

Cheryl,
I had a good conversation with Bob this afternoon. The major points he wanted to emphasize were the ones he had
included in his emails to you, including:
• "Rebalancing" Haitian development: Redevelopment should occur nationwide and encourage a more even
distribution of the Haitian population. The international community should not rebuild Port-au-Prince at the expense of
the rest of the country. Bob thinks that nationwide rebuilding will also reduce the chances of elite capture of the
rebuilding effort, since elites are strongly concentrated in Port-au-Prince.
• Transparency: Bob is cautious about just throwing money at the problem. He thinks the international
community should establish a new norm of transparency in Haiti, for example, to ensure that there isn't widespread
corruption, price gauging, grants of monopolies, etc.
• Link the Haitian business community to other business communities: Bob thinks that if all the rebuilding is done
by the usual suspects in the Haitian business community, they'll simply build back the country they had before. He
recommends working to bring in foreign investors, and then linking foreign investors and leading Haitian businessmen
(e.g., in a business roundtable) to socialize better business practices in Haiti.
• On the issue of legal authorities for reconstruction: Bob recommends exploring whether presidential
commission-like structures could be empowered to resolve the legal problems likely to arise as barriers to
reconstruction.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773532 Date: 08/31/2015
• Duration of US presence: Bob cautioned that most Haitians would be happy to see a long-term US military
presence in the country, though this would likely have adverse reputational consequences in the hemisphere for the
United States. Given that hurricane season will begin in the fall, Bob recommends that when we do draw down, we
make clear that we will return if needed.
• Getting people to work: Bob argued that NGOs may not be the best vehicles for getting Haitians to work (e.g.,
through job training, etc.). In short, they're too nice. Many Haitians have never held a regular job, are unfamiliar with
showing up on time, etc. They'll need a bit of tough love and discipline. Bob though ex-military might set the right kind
of example.
• Diaspora: Engaging the diaspora is clearly important, but we do not want to support widespread repatriation of
the diaspora as NGO employees, reconstruction experts, etc., at the expense of Haitians who never left. This reinforces
wage differentials and social discontent about returnees.
• Conditional cash transfers: Bob thinks that conditional cash transfer programs have a lot of potential to improve
education and the delivery of health services in Haiti.

Gordon Brown called Lou Susman a short while ago. Brown believes you should make a call to McGuinness this morning
around 830 am (DecIan and I agree that if you call McG you also must call Robinson). Brown proposes to speak with you
at 820 or so to bring you up to speed before those calls.
The current situation is that Brown and Cowen are in Belfast, and met with Robinson, McGuinness, and other parties
until 330 in the morning Belfast time. They have now resumed today. The sticking point is parades. Robinson wants the
current parades commission abolished because it gives Republicans too much say. McGuinness refuses to allow the
parades issue to be tied to the devolution issue.
The key message to McGuinness is to keep working this thing through -- not to take any drastic action that would bring
down the assembly or collapse the process.
DecIan agrees that this is the moment to make calls.
If you agree we can have the ops center set up the Brown call as well as the other two.
We'll get you some more background before the calls, but talking points will be fluid and shaped in large measure by
Brown's report.

Below is from the Economist blogger re efforts w/I EU to discredit Ashton, particularly from the French. Wouldn't hurt to
mention her positively with French interlocutors. See particularly this line: "There is, frankly, a whiff of old boy's network
against Lady Ashton: she is not a lifetime member of the honourable guild of former foreign ministers, and she is
surrounded by men in suits who think they know a lot more about foreign policy than she does. There is not much
sympathy for her complicated family life, involving young children, and much commuting between Brussels and Britain."
A blog by the author of our column on the European Union
Charlemagne's notebook <http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne>
• Why did Lady Ashton take the EU's foreign policy job?

NOT yet February, and the briefing against Catherine Ashton, the newly appointed EU foreign policy chief, is getting
nasty. Jean Quatremer, the Brussels blogger and well-connected EU correspondent of Liberation, dropped another
depth charge against the baroness tonight <http://bruxelles.blogs.liberation.fr/coulisses/2010/01/ashton-ne-
r%C3%A9pond-plus-au-t%C3%A91%C3%A9phone-europ%C3%A9en-apr%C3%A8s-20-heures.html#more> . His list of
complaints against her is long, and I have a feeling some of them are a smidgeon exaggerated. I find it hard to believe it
is literally impossible to reach Lady Ashton after eight o'clock in the evening as Mr Quatremer charges, because she
allegedly has her mobile telephones diverted to the EU situation centre (a small intelligence analysis cell staffed by
officers from national servicies) after that hour. I also have some doubts about the stress laid on the fact that she has
not yet got round to having top secret security clearance yet, so cannot see any confidential papers. As a former British
cabinet minister, and serving UK commissioner, something tells me the British at least may share just the odd secret
with her.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773686 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773686 Date: 08/31/2015
A senior official I saw today also made the point that any holder of Lady Ashton's post would currently be struggling with
teething problems and squabbling as the new foreign policy apparatus created by the Lisbon Treaty takes shape. There
is, frankly, a whiff of old boy's network against Lady Ashton: she is not a lifetime member of the honourable guild of
former foreign ministers, and she is surrounded by men in suits who think they know a lot more about foreign policy
than she does. There is not much sympathy for her complicated family life, involving young children, and much
commuting between Brussels and Britain.
Finally, at the risk of sounding too loyal to the British, I think Mr Quatremer is being unfair when he says that it suits the
Foreign Office in London to have Lady Ashton "sabotage" the post. My impression is that the British government feels
Lady Ashton needs a lot of support right now and worries she is not getting enough support, but at the same time
worries that if she receives too much help in the way of briefings and advice from British officials, she will be seen as a
British stooge. That may be a self-serving sort of fear (because it allows the British to offer Lady Ashton lots of help) but
it is real enough.
Other charges probably have something to them. They certainly chime with things I have been told by other people.
But most damaging, to my mind, is the intimate nature of some of the briefing: this stuff is coming from officials close to
Lady Ashton, or who are senior enough to have significant contact with her. And I can confirm from my own
conversations that people across the whole EU foreign policy machine are asking the same question: why did she take
this huge job, when her instinct seems to be to make it as low key as possible? That is a dangerous question mark to
have hanging over you.

Foreign Assistance and Development in a New Era
Thursday, January 28, 2010
U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar will deliver the following speech tonight at the Society for International Development's annual
dinner.
I thank the Society for International Development, its members and its leadership — Betsy Bassan and Joe Feuer — for the
work they do on development issues around the world, and for organizing this annual gala. It is unfortunate that
Chairman Kerry could not be with us tonight, but I know he shares my gratitude for your recognition.
I also want to take this opportunity to thank Dr. Shah for his remarks and to recognize the efforts of USAID and its new
Administrator in responding to the tragic earthquake in Haiti. Dr. Shah has faced one of the most challenging crises
imaginable only five days after being sworn in. The job ahead of him — in Haiti and around the globe — is monumental. I
look forward to supporting his work and that of his agency in the coming years. I commend all of our responders from all

government agencies for their courage, compassion, and skill as they continue their mission in Haiti, and I join all of you
in extending our prayers to the people of that nation.
Tonight I would like to offer a few points about where we have come from and where we might be going with regard to
U.S. investments in development.
The challenges of global poverty and hunger are growing at a time when worries about the sustainability of natural
resources are increasing. Population growth and increased affluence in some parts of the globe will require that we
more than double world food production by 2050 to keep pace. At the same time, to address environmental concerns,
we will have to harvest that food from roughly the same amount of land that is in production today. The accessibility
and availability of food deeply affects the health of populations. Childhood malnutrition has lifelong consequences for
the productivity of individuals and nations. Poverty denies opportunity to the world's young people and breeds
extremism and instability that spills over borders. It is not surprising that the CIA has long tracked and analyzed global
food supplies as an indicator of potential conflict.
There is probably not a person in this room who would disagree that development is critical for U.S. national security
and that the alleviation of poverty and hunger is a key component. This is a sentiment that is shared in most parts of our
government, including the Department of Defense.
But even though the importance of advancing development goals is evident, constructing the most efficient,
accountable, and transparent means for achieving those goals is complex and challenging. Differences of opinion exist
with regard to who should be performing development functions and how these activities should be integrated into our
broader foreign policy efforts. We have not reached a consensus within our government on who should be doing what,
where, when and why.
As we debate these issues, we should keep in mind that diplomacy and development are two distinct disciplines.
Although diplomacy and development often can be mutually reinforcing, at their core, they have different priorities,
resource requirements, and time horizons. Most obviously, diplomacy is far more concerned with solving immediate
problems, usually associated with countries of strategic interest. Although we hope that our development efforts will
sometimes yield short-term strategic benefits, that is not their primary purpose. In a development context, we are
willing to take a much longer view of the world and devote resources to countries of less, or even minimal, strategic
significance. We are willing to allow the diplomatic and national security benefits of development work to accrue over
time. And we are willing to engage in missions for purely altruistic reasons. These differences underscore why
development must be an independent partner of diplomacy, not merely its servant.
Reforming U.S. Foreign Assistance
Reforming U.S. foreign assistance — in both substance and architecture — has been a priority for the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee. Secretary Clinton has stated: "I want USAID to be seen as the premier development agency in the
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773691 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773691 Date: 08/31/2015
world." I share that sentiment. One of the basic questions with respect to foreign aid reform is how we can best
strengthen the capacity of USAID to run effective assistance programs. During the last two decades, decision-makers
have not made it easy for the agency to perform its mission. Development resources declined precipitously in the 1990s
and reorganization initiatives resulted in the agency's loss of evaluation, budget, and policy capacity. There is broad
consensus among development experts that the loss of these functions at USAID is inhibiting the success of our
development programs. Our development efforts will never be as effective as they should be if the agency that houses
most of our development expertise is cut out of relevant policy and budget decisions.
Events since 2001 have spurred greater investments in foreign assistance. But many of these resources have been
located outside of USAID. Roughly two dozen departments and agencies have taken over some aspects of foreign
assistance, including the Department of Defense and the Department of Agriculture.
The President has advocated doubling foreign assistance over time, and has announced new initiatives on food security
and health. Given the increased resources needed for these initiatives, it is crucial that the American people and
Congress have confidence that these funds will be used efficiently.
USAID must have a central role in development policy decisions. If we are to avoid inefficient experimentation, it must
have the capacity to evaluate programs and disseminate information about best practices and methods. That requires
policy makers to continue augmenting the agency's staffing and expertise. These principals are reflected in legislation
that Senator Kerry and I introduced last year, S. 1524, the Foreign Assistance Revitalization and Accountability Act.
The Administration has initiated two separate studies — the State Department's Quadrennial Diplomacy and
Development Review and the National Security Council's Presidential Study Directive on Development — in an attempt to
make recommendations on how development programs can better support U.S. foreign policy objectives. The QDDR will
not be completed until this fall and it is uncertain when, or if, we will know the outcomes of the PSD.
I am eager to review the Administration's ideas when they are ready. But in the meantime, Congress should be offering
its own ideas on how to improve our government's development capacity. The Kerry-Lugar foreign assistance reform bill
is the product of well over a year of research and analysis by Senators and their staffs. It has strong support in the aid
community. And it is co-sponsored by a bipartisan group of 23 Senators, twelve of whom are members of the Foreign
Relations Committee. This level of backing for a bill related to foreign assistance is extremely rare. It provides an
opportunity to build something approaching a consensus on this issue. I am hopeful that the Executive Branch will
recognize that a bill co-sponsored by a majority of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and nearly a quarter of the
full Senate should be given substantial weight in its review process. A strong development agency that serves under the
foreign policy guidance of the Secretary of State, as envisioned in our bill, will best empower her to advance U.S. goals.
A Development Policy Guided by Objectives
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773691 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773691 Date: 08/31/2015
Even as we reconsider our development architecture, it is vital that development policy is guided by objectives rather
than by how we organize our government to deliver development assistance. We should focus on the big issues — food
scarcity, poverty, disease, environmental degradation -- that prevent economic growth in a large swath of the world's
countries. Those objectives require that strategies reflect the needs of the countries we are helping rather than the
vagaries of our own budget process, which often allocates funds in response to lobbying pressures, media interest, or
political favoritism. Country strategies based on broad objectives also give us the best chance to avoid dependence on
arbitrary spending targets for specific sectors. For example, promoting food security requires investments not just in
agricultural productivity, but in clean water, infrastructure, basic and higher education, and land titling, to name just a
few factors.
The Global Food Security Act, which I authored with Senator Casey and which Senator Kerry has co-sponsored, reflects
these principles. The food price crisis that occurred in 2008 resulted from a culmination of policy choices by donor and
recipient governments over a decades-long period. That crisis was a wakeup call for the development community, for
international donors, and for policymakers worldwide. Because achieving food security must be a multi-sector endeavor
that goes beyond simply raising crop yields, U.S. policy must seek to integrate a variety of approaches and actors. At the
same time, we do not want to delegate responsibility for food security policy to multiple departments. That could
further weaken our already fractured foreign assistance structure. That is why our bill designates USAID, which has the
broad development experience necessary, as the lead agency to implement the strategy.
"Whole-of-Government" in Perspective
The term "whole-of-government" has come into vogue in policy circles. To the extent that the term underscores the
complexity of development problems and the need to apply the talents of a diverse set of agencies to their solution, it is
useful and descriptive. Our government must have the capacity to draw on expertise to achieve vital development
missions without artificial barriers erected by agencies. Many agencies are working together successfully on
development problems in many parts of the world.
But we should not mistake the term "whole-of-government" for an organizational strategy. Even if multiple agencies are
making contributions, someone must be in charge, someone must coordinate the activities of all involved, and someone
must take responsibility for inefficiencies and failures.
This is especially important in a development context because of our highly fragmented aid system. The risk is that the
term "whole-of-government," will be used to justify that fragmentation or preserve roles for agencies where they are
not justified. We also must be careful that the whole-of-government concept does not re-define development as a series
of technical decisions — from where to dig wells to which seeds to plant in which soils. Such a redefinition would devalue
the discipline of development, which many practitioners have spent a lifetime studying and testing. We know from long
experience that technical expertise must be grounded in an understanding of development. For example, agricultural
advancement depends as much or more on reaching women farmers, building agriculture education, and engaging civil
society in support of rural development than it does on seed quality and planting decisions. An integrated strategy can
only come from an agency that understands development is a separate discipline, as Dr. Shah has said.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773691 Date: 08/31/2015
I believe the starting point for any future design of our assistance programs should not be the status quo, but rather the
period in which we had a well-functioning and well-resourced aid agency. Even if we emphasize the talents of multiple
agencies, a strong aid agency that can design integrated country-specific strategies is a key to success.
Unity of Purpose
Instead of accepting whole-of-government, or any other organizational model, as the guiding narrative, I believe there is
a more helpful way of viewing the development mission — that is "unity-of-purpose." We need to be unified around
common purposes for which we can marshal the appropriate level of resources and variety of approaches. There will be
situations that call for the involvement of multiple agencies under the direction of one government entity. But, the
decision to involve other government actors should be driven by the purpose. Such is clearly the case now in Haiti. The
U.S. government and international actors are unified for the purpose of disaster response. That response involves the
coordination of hundreds of organizations to rescue people and to provide basic elements needed for survival. At some
point soon, the mission will evolve from disaster response to reconstruction to development. We should be asking
whether we will be able to maintain a unity-of-purpose even as that purpose changes.
The Lugar-Casey bill proposes that there be a unity-of-purpose around achieving global food security. Regardless of the
situation, it is the unity-of-purpose that should guide how foreign assistance is designed. I applaud Secretary Clinton for
adopting food security as a top priority. Her inter-agency team has been working diligently on its Global Food Security
and Hunger Initiative, and Congress has been responsive in appropriating funding. Many operational decisions have yet
to be made, particularly decisions relating to coordination, but I stand ready to work with the Administration to pass the
Lugar-Casey bill as soon as possible. I look forward to achieving a unity-of-purpose between Congress and the
Administration on food security.
These are not easy issues to solve. I applaud all of you here tonight for your dedication to development and your
willingness to work with Congress and the Administration as we try to rebuild our assistance infrastructure. I would
conclude with a quote from Dr. Norman Borlaug, the Nobel Laureate and Father of the Green Revolution, whose
optimism never flagged. He believed that constant striving would eventually wear down all obstacles. He said, "I cannot
emphasize too strongly the fact that further progress depends on intelligent, integrated and persistent effort by
government leaders, statesmen, tradesmen, scientists, educators and communication agencies." That is as true today as
when he said it 39 years ago, and I invite everyone here to make their own contributions in that spirit.

Speech of Senator Lugar
Foreign Assistance and Development in a New Era
Thursday, January 28, 2010
U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar will deliver the following speech tonight at the Society for International Development's annual
dinner.
I thank the Society for International Development, its members and its leadership — Betsy Bassan and Joe Feuer — for the
work they do on development issues around the world, and for organizing this annual gala. It is unfortunate that
Chairman Kerry could not be with us tonight, but I know he shares my gratitude for your recognition.
I also want to take this opportunity to thank Dr. Shah for his remarks and to recognize the efforts of USAID and its new
Administrator in responding to the tragic earthquake in Haiti. Dr. Shah has faced one of the most challenging crises

imaginable only five days after being sworn in. The job ahead of him — in Haiti and around the globe — is monumental. I
look forward to supporting his work and that of his agency in the coming years. I commend all of our responders from all
government agencies for their courage, compassion, and skill as they continue their mission in Haiti, and I join all of you
in extending our prayers to the people of that nation.
Tonight I would like to offer a few points about where we have come from and where we might be going with regard to
U.S. investments in development.
The challenges of global poverty and hunger are growing at a time when worries about the sustainability of natural
resources are increasing. Population growth and increased affluence in some parts of the globe will require that we
more than double world food production by 2050 to keep pace. At the same time, to address environmental concerns,
we will have to harvest that food from roughly the same amount of land that is in production today. The accessibility
and availability of food deeply affects the health of populations. Childhood malnutrition has lifelong consequences for
the productivity of individuals and nations. Poverty denies opportunity to the world's young people and breeds
extremism and instability that spills over borders. It is not surprising that the CIA has long tracked and analyzed global
food supplies as an indicator of potential conflict.
There is probably not a person in this room who would disagree that development is critical for U.S. national security
and that the alleviation of poverty and hunger is a key component. This is a sentiment that is shared in most parts of our
government, including the Department of Defense.
But even though the importance of advancing development goals is evident, constructing the most efficient,
accountable, and transparent means for achieving those goals is complex and challenging. Differences of opinion exist
with regard to who should be performing development functions and how these activities should be integrated into our
broader foreign policy efforts. We have not reached a consensus within our government on who should be doing what,
where, when and why.
As we debate these issues, we should keep in mind that diplomacy and development are two distinct disciplines.
Although diplomacy and development often can be mutually reinforcing, at their core, they have different priorities,
resource requirements, and time horizons. Most obviously, diplomacy is far more concerned with solving immediate
problems, usually associated with countries of strategic interest. Although we hope that our development efforts will
sometimes yield short-term strategic benefits, that is not their primary purpose. In a development context, we are
willing to take a much longer view of the world and devote resources to countries of less, or even minimal, strategic
significance. We are willing to allow the diplomatic and national security benefits of development work to accrue over
time. And we are willing to engage in missions for purely altruistic reasons. These differences underscore why
development must be an independent partner of diplomacy, not merely its servant.

Matt,
This is the email chain regarding the a possibly opportunity for the 4 Afghan women civil society representatives to meet
with the Secretary and take a photo. Three of the 4 are in the media center and Saba who has been travelling with them
isPhil suggested she contact Huma. If you have other thoughts on who Saba can contact let me know and I'll pass that
info along.
Saba is from the State Department's Office of Global Women's Issues covering Afghanistan for the U.S. Ambassador-at-
Large for Global Women's Issues, Ambassador Melanne Verveer.
Thanks,
Anjana

I had a group call me today... It is "F & B Catering" who have an agreement they are working to finalize with the
International Disaster Relief Fund... One of the principles is Craig Fant. Their operation is on the Gulf Coast. The
agreement would be to provide meals to 120,000 folks a day for a year in Haiti. I did a good bit of due diligence thru the
afternoon with contacts I have on the coast, in Jackson and in the Delta (the ag region) and these folks did a lot of the
Katrina work and have the staging facilities in Gulfport to move their goods to Haiti... the facility, in fact, was built with
Katrina money as part of the single largest FAA grant in history... this airport is used as the staging and departure area
for troops going to Afghanistan... the cargo terminals and personnel are equipped and experienced in this type of work.
Also, there has been a solid, transparent and deliberate effort by this company to work with and buy products from
minority farmers in the Delta... I don't know your politics, etc. I don't know the details on your end, boss... I get so many
requests each month wanting me to offer good words, etc. to you on behalf of some entity... most of the time it's all
about the dollar signs I see in their eyes... I ignore them... but my discovery process of F & B Catering, their Katrina work,
the confidence in their capacity, the use of post Katrina federally funded facilities and the commitment to minority
farmers was all compelling... so I share! Thanks, ma'am.

Here's the update, pieced together from various sources:
Starting at around 3 pm Friday, Adams and McGuinness returned to Hillsborogh to meet with Robinson and Arlene
Foster. The four talked privately for several hours and then asked for the draft papers to review. The discussion
continued until around 1 am when the parties left Hillsborough. (Foster's presence is apparently very helpful. Her
relationship with the SF leaders is much more positive and direct, treating them as equal colleagues.)
Woodward and Irish FM Martin will meet with Adams and Robinson separately this afternoon to assess where the talks
are. The talks last night/early morning ended more positively and if that is still the case there may be a decision to push
on today to see if agreement can be reached. It is equally possible that the two ministers and DUP/SF will decide to
wind up today and resume on Monday.
Brown and Cowen have spoken this morning and will speak again late this afternoon.
The issue is still parades. Robinson needs some certainity of change on parades. It is important for him politically within
the DUP, but also externally since this has become a symbol of whether he has achieved something or compromised too
much. Adams and SF have moved very far from their original positions on parades, adding that Robinson has also
moved.
The DUP linkage of the timeframes for devolution and parades is not Robinson's goal but DUP deputy party leader Nigal
Dodds. Logistically, such a linkage would be impossible without delaying devolution given that the parades framework
requires consultation, legislation, and implementation.
The role of Justice Minister and his/her relationship to the Executive has been agreed. Other issues, such as Irish
language act, N-S bodies, etc, while symbolic and emotive for SF and the nationalists community can be dealt with.

PESHAWAR (AP) - A local government official said a suicide car bomber attacked a tribal police patrol in northwestern
Pakistan, killing 10 policemen. Rasheed Khan says the attacker rammed his car into a vehicle carrying the police on a
main highway in the Khyber tribal area near the Afghan border. Another 15 people were injured in the attack. No
group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but Taliban militants often target Pakistani security forces.

Missed Shaun, but was just on the phone with his COS, who said there are still some details to be worked out Monday.
She "wouldn't put a full stop on it," but things are looking very good.
Looks like tomorrow will be a down day and then they'll reconvene Monday to try to bang out the last details and
announce.

Shaun has just called me—about 9 p.m. EST. He says it is very likely that an agreement will be announced on Monday.
The parties have reached agreement tonight. Shaun will call you on Sunday to brief. Gordon will fly into Belfast on
Monday for a ceremony if all goes according to plan now. He will mention your role. You should be prepared to speak to
the parties before the event and issue a statement. Hope it doesn't come unraveled over the next 36 hours.

Draft Statement by the Secretary as Revised by Senator Mitchell
This Administration has, from the beginning, worked to bring about comprehensive peace in the Middle East, including a
two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. On that issue our approach has been three-fold: (1) to help build
the economy and capacity to govern of a Palestinian state; (2) to renew political negotiations to enable the earliest
possible establishment of that state; and (3) to achieve these in a manner that ensures the security of Israel and of the
Palestinians.
Consistent with Prime Minister Fayyad's plan for a future Palestinian state, and to support the political negotiations,
Tony Blair, as the Quartet representative, will intensify his partnership with Senator Mitchell to mobilize the efforts of
the international community: (1) to build support for the institutional capacity and governance of a future Palestinian
State; (2) to improve freedom of movement and access for Palestinians; (3) to encourage further private sector
investment; and (4) to bring change in the living conditions of the people in Gaza.
Original Draft Statement by the Secretary Submitted by Tony Blair
The United States is determined to bring about a two-state solution. Believes there is a strong basis for doing
so. Believes it can be done by combining a renewed political negotiation with change on the ground, bottom up, as set
out in Prime Minister Fayyad's plan for a Palestinian state.
To this end, Tony Blair, as Quartet Representative, will work in partnership with Senator Mitchell to support the political
negotiation by mobilizing the efforts of the international community: (1) to build support for the institutional capacity
and future governance of a future Palestinian state; (2) to improve freedom of movement and access for Palestinians;
(3) to encourage further private sector investment; and (4) to bring change in the living conditions of the people in Gaza.

Just FYI on the below, from one of those crazy right "magazines" - notes that the home you referenced in your Prayer
Breakfast remarks has since closed.
I checked in with Lissa & Melanne, they didn't know it closed, which makes sense since it happened in 2002 after you left
the White House.
I made it clear that your longtime commitment to this issue - throughout your public career - is well known, and you
remain very proud of your work with Mother Teresa in opening this home in 1995. And that your partnership is a
success story to be emulated.
Again, this is just FYI

ADOPTION I Hillary Clinton continues to hail an adoption home she helped open with Mother Teresa that has since
closed its doors By Emily Belz
WASHINGTON—An adoption ministry Secretary of State Hillary Clinton hailed as a home she helped open with Mother
Teresa no longer handles adoptions and its phone line has been disconnected, though at last week's National Prayer
Breakfast Clinton spent five minutes of her 30-minute speech relating the story of its opening. Last Thursday Clinton
described Mother Teresa "beaming about what this meant for children and their futures," seemingly oblivious that the
Mother Teresa Home for Infant Children in northwest Washington, D.C., is now defunct. She said she worked tirelessly
to "cut through all the red tape," although it appears that red tape prevented the work from continuing. According to a
pastor at the church next door to the home's former location, the adoption ministry failed to take off because the
Roman Catholic nuns who ran it weren't allowed to care for babies without medical personnel on site. "I'm not sure the
legal thing that came down upon them, but they realized they needed to expend their energies in another way," said
Maureen Freshour, who along with her husband, David, pastors Chevy Chase Baptist Church and lives nearby. Freshour
has stayed in touch with the nuns from the Missionaries of Charity order who ran the home and said that the remaining
three or four sisters have moved to another house in Washington, where they are ministering to the homeless."This has
been a core issue—adoption—whether the home [Clinton] talked about survived or not," said Chuck Johnson, chief
operating officer of the National Council for Adoption. "It's an issue she's been consistent on."During her speech on
Thursday, Clinton reminisced about the 1994 National Prayer Breakfast when she attended as first lady and Mother
Teresa was the speaker. The Roman Catholic nun delivered a blistering speech about abortion, saying, "Any country that
accepts abortion is not teaching its people to love, but to use any violence to get what they want." Mother Teresa then

called on attendees to fight abortion through adoption: "Please don't kill the child. I want the child. Please give me the
child."The audience that day gave her a standing ovation—but President and Mrs. Clinton, both pro-abortion, did not
stand. Afterward, Mother Teresa asked to meet with Hillary Clinton and they went to talk behind a curtain on the stage,
sitting on folding chairs, Mother Teresa in sandals even though it was winter."She told me that she knew that we had a
shared conviction about adoption being vastly better as a choice for unplanned or unwanted babies," Clinton related last
Thursday. "And she asked me—or more properly, she directed me—to work with her to create a home for such babies
here in Washington."Clinton followed through and set up a home for unwanted babies in Washington in just over a year,
no small feat in a city that was known then for its inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy. The Mother Teresa Home for
Infant Children opened in June 1995 in the district's affluent Chevy Chase neighborhood to house eight pregnant
mothers and their babies—but it remains unclear whether it facilitated any adoptions.I called the Missionaries of Charity
in Washington, a worldwide Roman Catholic order established by Mother Teresa. The nun who answered the phone said
she couldn't give her name because they aren't allowed to talk to the press. She did say, however, that the sisters who
are in the order now were not in the order when the adoption home opened, so she wasn't sure why it closed. She
added that the order sold the Chevy Chase house in 2002. "We work with the poor and we didn't have any work there
because it's a rich neighborhood," she said. The sisters, she added, are now working with the homeless and those with
AIDS in a more transitional neighborhood in the northeast section of town on Otis Street.

Interesting observations from Declan:
Foster was a critical component in the talks apparently. However there is already'speculation that PR may use this
moment to try to come back early and resume position of FM given that the other investigations have been delayed
pending the outcome of the police investigation. He went to London with his family yesterday to visit his wife, who is in
a clinic there apparently.
Empey still not on board apparently so the "community confidence" round may be used to put pressure on him to do so.
Our intervention on Thursday night/Friday morning was seen as a very important moment/catalyst. That, coupled with
the jobs losses that day and the fact that the radio and tv phone-in lines and newspapers were full of commentary
supporting what we said, seems to have made people realize, that they couldn't lose the moment.

Blair's guy said you ok'ed releasing today. If so, we'll pull the trigger. It is pasted below:
Statement by the Secretary
This Administration has, from the beginning, worked to bring about comprehensive peace in the Middle East, including a
two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. On that issue our approach has been three-fold: (1) to help build the
economy and capacity to govern of a Palestinian state; (2) to renew political negotiations to enable the earliest possible
establishment of that state; and (3) to achieve these in a manner that ensures the security of Israel and of the
Palestinians.
Consistent with Prime Minister Fayyad's plan for a future Palestinian state, Tony Blair, as the Quartet representative, will
intensify his partnership with Senator Mitchell in support of the political negotiations. In his role as Quartet
Representative Tony Blair will continue, with full support by and coordination with Senator Mitchell, to mobilize the
efforts of the international community: (1) to build support for the institutional capacity and governance of a future
Palestinian State, including on the rule of law; (2) to improve freedom of movement and access for Palestinians; (3) to
encourage further private sector investment; and (4) to bring change in the living conditions of the people in Gaza.

Subject: Pinera-Insulza
See the report below: Pinera has announced his support.
I had a long conversation with Craig a little while ago. He spoke with a number of people in Chile, including his close
friend,
According to Craig, Pinera had made the calculation that it would be politically untenable to dump Insulza. Apparently
there is a coalition leadership in the lower house, and Insulza's party, Concertacion, controls the upper house. So he had
no choice.
That said, Craig believes that his clear message had an impact on what Pinera told Insulza. He apparently gave his
support with two conditions: (1) don't interfere in Chilean politics, and (2) take the democratization agenda seriously
and don't carry the ALBA countries' water.
Craig also said that Arturo had been effective in making clear that the jury was out on Insulza in Washington -- that had
an impact on the Pinera government and reinforced their second message to him.
Bottom line: Craig said we couldn't have talked Pinera off of this, but we helped drive a stronger set of conditions on
Pinera's support.

Subject: FW: Mark Penn's latest Huffington Post blog: "Stopping the Republican Comeback (Déjà Vu All Over Again)"
Great internet speech based on excerpts I have seen — terrific. Here's piece I did yesterday.
The Huffington Post
January 20, 2010
Strategy Corner: Stopping the Republican Comeback (Déjà Vu All Over Again)
Once again an initially popular Democratic president tries to pass healthcare reform, raise taxes on the wealthy
and expand domestic spending. And once again the voters send a sharp signal that they want him to chart a more
centrist course. As Yogi Berra said "It's déjà vu all over again."
President Clinton's wakeup call came with the 1994 mid-term elections -- Obama's came a year earlier with
yesterday's special election in Massachusetts.
In response to the similar situation, President Clinton fundamentally changed everything -- his team, his policies,
and the overall direction and message of his administration. He moved to the center with a balanced budget, welfare
reform, and policies that helped concerned moms raise their kids, leaving behind the divisive bitterness of his first two
years. As a part of that new team then, I saw how President Clinton consciously took his presidency back to the centrist
message of his presidential campaign and relentlessly pursued swing voters; he didn't go small, he went to the vital
center -- 24 million jobs and a balanced budget were big accomplishments.
President Obama now has plenty of time to turn this around before facing the kind of losses President Clinton
did. But stopping the Republican machine now will not be done on the basis of words alone -- it will take actions and
results to calm this electorate.
It also won't be done on the basis of stepped up populist rhetoric. You can't make deals with Wall Street,
Pharma, and other major interest groups and then turn around and make them the whipping boy with any credibility.
No doubt there will be a fight over this in the White House with many inside wanting to go back to the equivalent of
"people vs. the powerful." Only the voters see the White House as the powerful now and such a lurch would probably
have the harshest electoral consequences next November.
But Obama can turn it around and keep the country moving on a steady path of change if he makes the kind of
significant changes in his direction that President Clinton did. It's all about getting above the trappings of Washington
and being who you said you were.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773929 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773929 Date: 08/31/2015
Here's five things the President could do now.
1) Agree to full transparency in health care hearings and other major reform areas -- Obama's original idea to
put them on C-SPAN was the right one. Then go on a major transparency in government binge, seeking out new ways to
bring people closer to what the administration is doing through social networking and other online means. Make
transparency an action, not a theme.
2) Break health care up into its components and move them step by step. The problem with health care is no
one agrees on the solution and this bill is not about the longer lives, greater access and greater efficiency people want.
Break it down and start with the easy stuff like electronic medical records first and work up to the harder parts year
after year.
3) Look for ways to be genuinely bi-partisan instead of seeking the 60th vote through deals and compromise.
Genuine bi-partisanship would have given the Republicans malpractice reform in exchange for a public option -- if you
don't invest the opposition in the outcome, then they have no reason to support it. Just looking for one vote is an
exercise in deal making and compromise that does not live up to the post-partisan promise. Obama's got to call the
Republican leaders and sit down with them, not push them away.
4) Put jobs front and center -- the failure to do this earlier is at the root of the discontent. The administration hit
the 10 per cent tripwire of unemployment and the numbers in the center of the country are dismal -- far worse than
Massachusetts. This means moving the country forward into the new economic world, not trying to take it backwards.
Raising taxes is another flash point now as much of the administration's support came from upper income voters turned
off by the right wing, anti-intellectual campaigns of the Republicans. People need to know there is a strategy for
competing and winning in the emerging global, high tech economy.
5) Don't be afraid to do what some think of as the small stuff -- helping people in their daily lives. Helping people
deal with the new stresses of modern life -- from texting on the road to many working well past 65 -- is not a small thing.
People are again afraid of big, grandiose plans that they fear can bankrupt the country and need to see the government
also relating to their daily lives in manageable, concrete ways. It's the kind of daily activism Democrats uniquely bring to
the White House. This has got to be part of a strategy that returns us to lower unemployment, lower deficits, and
restrained spending.
There will be plenty of time to push back on the Republicans when they get too heady. That day will come as it
did when Newt Gingrich shut down the government and it backfired. But right now the Republicans are not the issue --
the issue is whether the administration has gone Washington and whether it can reclaim the centrist, people-oriented
mantle that brought it to town. And this means taking the administration back to the vital center and fulfilling its core
promises -- greater transparency, less political posturing, true bi-partisanship, extreme focus on jobs and the economy,
and a government that demonstrates daily how really cares about the people.

Re: Saudi Arabia
I have been in contact with Chas Freeman, former ambassador to Saudi Arabia, and he has sent me his most recent
public speech on the subject. He says the policy part is toward the end, and that King Abdullah's new university (KAUST)
is an important initiative. He also relates that the atmosphere is near toxic because of Obama's failure to follow up his
Cairo speech and the rebuff from Netanyahu. Cynicism, at best, is pervasive among the Saudi elite.
Saudi Arabia: The End of Progress without Change Remarks to the Sarasota Institute for Lifetime Learning
Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.) Sarasota, Florida, February 11, 2010
I have been asked to speak to you about the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This is a topic I have never before addressed to
an American audience. Why bother?
We Americans reserve the right to have strong opinions on the basis of little or no knowledge. There are few countries
that better exemplify our assertive ignorance of foreign geography, history, and culture than Saudi Arabia. Most of us

are convinced that Saudis are Muslim zealots, control the world's oil prices, and are absurdly rich, anti-feminist, and
undemocratic. They hate our values and want to destroy us. Talk radio confirms this. What more needs to be said?
On reflection, a lot does. Neither caricature nor a priori reasoning is a sound basis for policy. A distorted view of foreign
realities precludes success at dealing with them. There is much at stake in our relationship with Saudi Arabia. We can ill
afford to get it wrong.
That country is, of course, the heartland of Islam and the custodian of the world's largest oil reserves. It lies athwart
transport routes between Asia, Europe, and Africa. It is at the center of a growing concentration of global capital.
Under any circumstances, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia would be important. It is all the more so in an era when we
Americans are at war with ever more peoples in the Islamic world, depend on ever greater amounts of imported energy,
and need ever larger foreign loans to run our government and sustain our life style.
Yet Saudi Arabia is little known. It is the only society on the planet not to have been penetrated by Western colonialism.
No European armies breached its borders; no missionaries; no merchants. Its capital, Riyadh, was long off limits to
infidels; the holy cities of Mecca and Medina remain so today. When Westerners finally came to Saudi Arabia, we came
not as the vindicators of our presumed cultural superiority, but as hired help. As a result, some say that Saudis secretly
see the world's peoples as divided into two basic categories: (1) fellow Saudis; and (2) potential employees. Be that as it
may, foreigners, Western, Asian, or Arab, who have lived in Saudi Arabia all see it as a very strange place — one that is
not easy to understand and that remains at odds with many of the values non-Saudis profess.
The Kingdom has long stood apart from global norms. Its system of government draws on tribal and Islamic traditions
rather than Western models: Its king presides rather than rules over the royal family and Saudi society. His
responsibility is less to make decisions than to shape and proclaim consensus, while assuring a share of the national
wealth to all, especially the least privileged. Saudi Arabia levies no taxes on its citizens, other than the religious tithe
known as "zakat" — a two-and-a-half percent annual donation of private capital to charity and other public purposes. All
Saudis enjoy free education and medical care from birth to death and can pursue these services at home or abroad, as
they wish. The Kingdom has no parliament, though it does have elaborate informal mechanisms for consultation with its
citizens on policy matters. Saudi Arabia reverses and thereby affirms a basic principle of American political philosophy.
"No representation without taxation."
Unlike some other countries in the Arab Gulf, Saudi Arabia has invested its oil wealth at home, not abroad, though it has
long been generous with foreign aid. (At one point it was donating six percent of GDP to other, mostly Muslim, nations.)
The desperate poverty of the pre-oil period is now, at most, a dim memory. Over the lifetime of elderly Saudis, the
Kingdom's per capita income has risen about one hundred fold. Sparsely populated mud-walled villages have grown into
huge air-conditioned cities with 21st Century architecture. Today, Saudis are not just literate; many have university
degrees. There are more U.S. Ph.D.'s in the Saudi Cabinet than in our Cabinet and Congress put together.
Despite rapid development, the strong family structure that characterized traditional Saudi society has remained largely
intact. It is truly moving to see how lovingly children and grandchildren care for their elders in the Kingdom. Saudi
Arabia's unique social stability is reflected in the fact that almost none of its citizens emigrate, though many have second
homes abroad, and a few, like Osama Binladin, have been exiled for deviant behavior..
For a long time it was easier for journalists and academics to get a visa to Tibet than to Saudi Arabia. Perhaps this
accounts for the near total lack of institutions and scholars that study the place. In the United States, 9/11 was followed
by an avalanche of polemical tracts, but there are still very few books about the Kingdom that reflect its realities rather
than the authors' biases or propagandistic agendas. Lack of personal familiarity with the Kingdom helps explain the
repeated prediction by pundits that the Saudi monarchy is in jeopardy. Generations of such pundits have passed away.
The Kingdom has not. When I was ambassador to Riyadh, I was so struck by the apparent social stasis that I briefly
thought the national motto should be "progress without change." But in fact change is a constant in Saudi Arabia. Most
of it comes from the top down.

Not all Saudis are happy with the status quo. Some are angry about the extent to which the Kingdom is opening up and
reforming. Others are impatient to get on with reform. The ranks of the latter clearly include King Abdullah bin
Abdulaziz Al-Sasud, the current ruler. Now in his late eighties and on the throne only since 2005, he has surprised
everyone with the vigor of his efforts to modernize Saudi society and to reshape its relationships with the world beyond
its borders. Saudi Arabia has plenty of problems to keep the king engaged.
A lot of issues derive from the peculiar religious heritage of the Saudi state. The current Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (now
over a century old) is the third political structure to ally the House of Sa‘ud with the family of the eighteenth century
religious reformer Shaykh al Islam Mohammed ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab Al-Tamimi. Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab's writings form the
doctrinal basis of so-called Wahhabism, a notoriously intolerant and socially conservative form of Islam that is often
confused with other reactionary religious traditions like that of the Taliban. Saudi history has involved a sustained effort
by the Kingdom's rulers to persuade its religious scholars and their puritanical followers to embrace change and to open
up to the outside world. This struggle has mainly been peaceful and virtually invisible to outsiders. Sometimes,
however, it has engendered violence. In 1975, for example, the late King Faisal paid with his life for instituting public
education for girls and for introducing television to his nation.
Both as regent (from 1996 to 2005) and more recently as ruler, King Abdullah has been so careful to avoid drama in his
promotion of change that it is truly startling to review the cumulative results of his leadership. Take women's issues, for
example. In 2002, responsibility for girls' education was transferred from the religious authorities to the ministry of
education. Women now make up 58 percent of the enrollment in Saudi universities. The new Princess Noura bint
Abdulrahman University for Women, currently under construction in Riyadh, will enroll 40,000 students this fall.
Female participation in the labor force is rising rapidly. Twenty-nine percent of women now work outside the home.
(That is a low figure compared to our own but represents a remarkable advance for the Kingdom.) One-third of civil
service positions have been reserved for women. The first woman took her seat in the Council of Ministers last year.
After a bit of a kerfuffie, the Kingdom's religious scholars finally endorsed coeducation at the new King Abdullah
University for Science and Technology. That was big blow to the legitimacy of gender apartheid. A Saudi friend and I are
betting that it will not be long before women in the Kingdom can drive. We plan to clean up by building the separate
road system this may require. (That's a joke, i hope.)
A word abciut the vision embodied in the King Abdullah University for Science and Technology. F6unded by the king last
September with an initial endowment of ten billion dollars, KAUST is an international, graduate-level research university.
It sits in a two-billion-dollar campus on the Red Sea about seventy-five miles northwest of Mecca. On one level, it is the
leading element in an effort to prepare the Kingdom for a knowledge-based economy that can complement and
eventually supercede the current reliance on energy exports. But on another level, it is a powerful answer to the
religious zealotry that terrorist movements like al Qa'ida espouse. Let me explain.
There is a broad consensus among the world's 1.6 billion Muslims that the modern age is ethically corrupt and that
religious faith needs reinvigoration and renewal. Much like early Christian Protestants, many believe that the way to
achieve this is to rediscover and reaffirm the values of their religion's earliest times. When he inaugurated KAUST, King
Abdullah explained that he envisaged it as a reborn Bayt al-Hikma or "House of Wisdom." The original "House of
Wisdom" was founded in Baghdad around 760 C.E., in the second century of the Muslim era. It was where the Arabs
incorporated Greek, Indian and other foreign knowledge into Islam and conceived much of modern mathematics,
astronomy, medicine, chemistry, zoology, and geography. It made Islamic civilization the global leader in science and
technology. The "House of Wisdom" prospered in an age of tolerance, when Jews and Christians served alongside
Muslims as ministers of government. Though destroyed by the Mongols in 1258, the knowledge it preserved and
developed eventually found its way to Europe, where it sparked the Renaissance.
Today, like mainstream Muslims, the extremists of al Qa'ida and related movements argue that Islam must return to its
roots. But they portray early Islam as puritanical, xenophobic, intolerant, and oppressive of women. KAUST is a living
rebuttal of this historical fallacy and the ideology of hatred derived from it. It was conceived as a new "House of
Wisdom." It stands for the principle that Islam was founded as and can only be reborn as the religious guide to a society
open to ideas from other traditions. It represents a call for return to an Islam tolerant of foreign ways, respectful of

women, dedicated to the scientific study of God's handiwork, and committed to the development of new technologies
to better the human condition. KAUST is as much an instrument of religious renaissance and an answer to extremism as
it is an academic institution.
This brings me to the issue of religious tolerance. In 2003, King Abdullah inaugurated what he called a "national forum
for intellectual dialogue." This ongoing national dialogue is an unprecedented acceptance of religious diversity in the
Kingdom. It marks an end to longstanding official discrimination against its Shiite minority. In 2007, King Abdullah made
an historic call on the Pope in the Vatican, the first time a Muslim leader of his stature had done so. In 2008 he
organized two unprecedented international interfaith conferences between Muslims, Jews, Christians, Buddhists, and
others at Madrid and New York. He intends this dialogue, too, to be a continuing process.
There are other major domestic reform initiatives in progress, like a complete revamping of the Saudi educational
system and curriculum, experiments with elections at lower levels of government and civil society, efforts to shift the
Kingdom toward reliance on alternative sources of energy, the development of a huge new petrochemical industry to
complement the production of energy in its primary form. Time will not permit me to describe these developments. My
point is simply that there is a great deal more going on in Saudi Arabia than our press and pundits seem to realize.
That said, everything is, of course, relative. Sadly, to many Saudis, the history of their nation suggests that the more
religiously uptight they are, the more oil comes out of the ground. The Kingdom continues in many ways to belie God's
admonition in the Holy Quran that "there can be no compulsion in religion." The open practice of religions other than
Islam remains banned. The status and role of women in Saudi society is controversial and far from settled. Despite
efforts at "Saudiization," foreign workers continue to dominate the employment market, while demanding a premium to
compensate for the discomfort and stress that Saudi Arabia's religiously sanctioned mores impose on them. Methods of
political consultation that worked in a more cohesive and less populous Saudi Arabia can no longer produce consensus.
The fiscal basis of the state continues to be oil exports, and oil is a commodity whose price fluctuates unpredictably.
There is, in other words, a very long list of problems for Saudis to work out in coming years.
Let me turn briefly to Saudi Arabia's foreign relations before reviewing the state of our country's interaction with it.
In foreign even more than domestic affairs, King Abdullah's impact has been little short of revolutionary. He has
overseen the negotiated settlement of the Kingdom's long-disputed borders with all of its neighbors. He brought Saudi
Arabia into the World Trade Organization, ensuring that its trade and investment activities for the first time follow
internationally agreed rules. In 1982, at Beirut, he led the Arab League in an historic reversal of policy toward the Israel-
Palestine issue. Saudi Arabia had long insisted that it would be the last state in the region to recognize and establish
relations with Israel. At Beirut, King Abdullah committed to be the first to normalize relations with Israel upon its
achievement of a mutually acceptable arrangement for coexistence with the Palestinians. He persuaded all other Arab
countries to promise they would do the same. To his great frustration, Israel did not respond. Since then, hope for a
two-state solution that could gain acceptance for Israel in the region has dimmed.
Many of Saudi Arabia's foreign policy challenges stem from recent American policies in the region. These policies have
had the effect of liberating Israel from all constraints on its settlement activities and belligerent intervention in its Arab
neighbors, installing Iran as the dominant political influence in both Iraq and Lebanon, consolidating rather than eroding
the Syrian-Iranian alliance, pushing Hamas into the arms of the Iranians, and raising regional tensions over Tehran's
nuclear program while doing nothing effective about it. Then there is Afghanistan, where the United States now seems
to be engaged in a crusade against militant Islam — one that many in the region now fear may soon extend to Yemen.
Saudi counter-terrorism specialists, who have a well-deserved international reputation for effectiveness, are convinced
that the most efficient way to radicalize Muslim populations and encourage terrorism against the United States and its
foreign policy partners is to invade, occupy, and humiliate them. They believe that the panicked militarism of the U.S.
response to 9/11 was exactly what groups like al Qa'ida hoped for. They see no sign that the United States is about to
abandon actions and policies that metastasize extremism and stimulate terrorist reprisal against Americans and our
foreign friends.

No longer willing to be publicly associated with U.S. policies in the Holy Land, Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere that
radicalize the region and menace the Kingdom's own security, Saudi Arabia is actively attempting to reduce its historic
dependence on America. To this end, it is building new relationships with countries like China, India, and Russia, while
strengthening cooperation with longstanding partners in Europe and Asia like Britain, France, Germany, Japan, and
south Korea. It is not that the Kingdom has given up on the United States. As the king's scholarship program for Saudi
students in this country evidences, Saudi Arabia continues to reach out and seek improved relations with America. But
Saudis no longer trust us to take their interests into account or to protect them from their enemies.
In December 2002, as the U.S. prepared to invade Iraq against the forcefully expressed advice of then Crown Prince
Abdullah, Saudi Aramco (the world's largest oil company) quietly abandoned a decades-old subsidy for the cost of
shipping oil to the North American market. Within months, China replaced the United States as the Kingdom's biggest
overseas market for oil. U.S. exports have remained relatively constant as the Saudi Arabian economy has boomed,
dramatically reducing our market share in our largest Middle Eastern market. Ironically, the best element of the US-
Saudi relationship is now cooperation against terrorists. This is a task in which the Saudis have perforce learned to excel.
American policies ensure an endless supply of angry young Muslim men in the region, including in Saudi Arabia.
The United States is now said to have entered a "long war." The last time we did so, in 1947 with Soviet Communism,
the enemy was obvious, George Kennan gave us a strategy, and skillful American diplomacy gave us the allies we needed
to pursue it. Kennan's "long telegram" from Moscow outlined a comprehensive approach to the political, economic,
cultural, and military containment of the threat to our survival and our values posed by the Soviet Union. We followed
his outline. Forty years later, as Kennan forecast, without our having to go to war with the USSR, our Soviet enemy
collapsed of its own infirmities.
This time, our "long war" is with various Islamic extremists, tribes, sects, and societies. We're not quite sure who our
enemy is. No Kennan has emerged to give us a strategy f6r winning without fighting or, indeed, any "strategy" at all.
instead, we are flailing about with our superbly lethal military in response to events. Lacking a strategy, we have been
unable to recruit foreign partners to support one. We are now alone in Iraq. We are isolated internationally on the
Israel-Palestine issue. Our NATO allies are with us in Afghanistan out of consideration for NATO, not because they think
we know what we are doing. Many of them have already announced their intention to withdraw. Pakistan is with us
only because all its alternatives are worse.
Saudi Arabia and America head al Qa'ida's enemies list. The Kingdom has, however, been successfully vilified in the eyes
of the American elite and public. To deal effectively with Islamic extremism, we need Muslim allies. There is none more
potent that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Yet we have made no effort to seek its advice about how to address the
challenges of Islamic extremism. We have not sought its help to legitimize an effective political, informational, cultural,
and economic strategy for productive engagement with the Islamic world.
Meanwhile, however, many things now happening in the Kingdom — like the implicit message of the king's vision for
KAUST — suggest that such a partnership with Saudi Arabia and Arab nations of like mind is possible. Such a partnership
could be the basis for a strategy to bring victory in this latest "long war." The common interests on which to forge an
alliance are clearly there. Last June in Cairo, President Obama brilliantly articulated a credible basis for sound relations
with the Islamic world. His vision was persuasive, but it remains a mirage, not a reality. It is past time to implement it.
An intensive effort to reset the relationship with Saudi Arabia and to craft a common antiterrorist strategy with its king
would be a good place to start.

I'm sorry I was not able to join last week's meeting on Haiti but I have calls into Anne Marie and Arturo to get an update.
Once I get a better understanding of how we plan to move forward on a regional basis we will work on putting together
a comprehensive PD strategy to support our efforts.
If you like the idea I can begin to trial balloon it with media execs in US and LA that I know
personally to gauge their reaction.
Of course we can't rely on a psa campaign alone to sustain the effort so we will develop other PD strategies for
engagement throughout the region which I will forward as they evolve.
Let me know what you think. In the meantime I thought you might be interested in the report below (copy attached as
well) which outlines the results to date of our global media outreach initiative.

Successfully Engaging Global Media
About the U.S. Role and International Cooperation in Haiti
Examples of Post Efforts to Date
EUROPE
• Reinforcing the Secretary's message, U.S. Ambassador to France Rivkin engaged directly with over 100 journalists in
an event streamed live on-line by CNN, where he highlighted U.S. assistance to Haiti and the cooperation of the US with
France, the UN and the international community. Embassy Paris also reached out to senior officials in the Elysee, MFA,
French media and civil society at all levels to underscore the message of positive coordination with our French partners
and to set the record straight on the work of the USG in Haiti. As a result, leading French officials dismissed rumors of
rising diplomatic tensions between the two countries. Leading officials consistently praised the work of the Obama
administration in Haiti and the need for a strong US role in the emergency response.
• Embassy London's media blitz featured Ambassador Susman, who underlined the U.S. commitment to Haiti at an
Embassy Martin Luther King Jr. holiday event with actor James Earl Jones; the event was covered by BBC World News
(audience 270 million worldwide) and various U.K. papers. The Ambassador and the 10 also spoke about Haiti on
January 20-22 on BBC TV 2's "Daily Politics Show," BBC Radio, the BBC TV Evening News, and other media and helped
embed an ITV journalist on the USNS Comfort to help balance ITV's previously negative reporting and reached out
personally to BBC producers to call attention to inaccurate reporting alleging that the U.S. military prevented Medicins
Sans Frontiers from delivering aid and supplies to the airport in Port Au Prince.
• With media coverage growing more critical, U.S. Ambassador to Greece Speckhard gave an interview to Ta Nea
newspaper and DCM Deborah McCarthy, who previously served in Haiti, was interviewed by Real Sunday newspaper,
resulting in positive stories about U.S. assistance to Haiti. Meanwhile, the PAO spoke with the Director of Elefterotypia,
whose paper has run some of the most misdirected coverage of Haiti, and received a commitment to run an Embassy-
produced story to counteract the misinformation.
AFRICA
• Four African posts — Senegal, Ghana, Nigeria and Tanzania — organized highly successful outreach programs based on
the diversion of the USS Gunston Hall to Haiti. The ship, with African officers aboard, was headed to western Africa
under AFRICOM's African Partnership Station maritime security training program when it was diverted to provide relief
to Haiti. With African officers working alongside U.S. military officers to deliver assistance to Haitians, PAOs at those
posts connected local reporters with the ship to conduct live interviews of the Africans for their home media, resulting in
excellent media placement in all four countries.
• On January 20 U.S. Ambassador to South Africa Gips gave a 10-minute live interview on Haiti with 5FM, a leading
youth station with listenership of approx 800,000. The Ambassador highlighted the depth and breadth of US support
and congratulated South Africa for sending emergency teams. The radio hosts told the Embassy afterward that e-mails
and SMS messages were pouring into the station in support of U.S. efforts. Ambassador Gips reached out to additional
audiences via broadcast media on January 21 and recorded a program via the Africa Regional Media Hub with SABC-
International TV's "Rendezvous Africa" program (broadcast across the continent) and live interviews with drive-time
radio programs on two national stations.

• As a result of a press conference hosted by the Embassy on January 22, all major Angolan media gave positive
coverage to U.S. efforts in Haiti, including Radio Nacional de Angola and the Jornal de Angola newspaper, which ran an
editorial January 23 that stated: "We need to believe and let those on the ground do their work because the old tactics
of criticizing who is doing something for the Haitian People just for the sake of criticizing at a moment like this is not
acceptable... Just see the numbers of daily flights that arrive in Haiti to have an idea and quickly come to the conclusion
that the possible failures and omissions do not supersede the positive and timely work done by the entities undertaking
the relief efforts in Haiti."
EAST ASIA-PACIFIC
• The U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia's January 21 byliner on Haiti ran as the lead item on the editorial page of Seputar
Indonesia daily, and it was subsequently picked up by Antara, the Indonesian national news agency, and subsequently
appeared in most Indonesian media.
• South Korea: Looking to help Korean audiences connect with the situation in Haiti, PA Seoul arranged a Digital Video
Conference with the U.S. Consul in Nagoya, Japan, who had previously served as Information Officer in Port-au-Prince
and was a fluent Korean speaker. CG Kwak underlined the long tradition of US humanitarian assistance to Haiti as well
as the massive US response to the current crisis and noted Korea's own active involvement in the relief work. The U.S.
Ambassador's blog on January 22, dedicated to the earthquake and those affected by it, received more than 1,500 hits in
three days, with almost all comments supporting U.S. concerns.
The EAP Regional Media Hub in Tokyo hosted a journalists' roundtable with Gordon Duguid in Haiti on January 25 that
included journalists from Hong Kong's Ming Pao newspaper, Malaysia's New Straits Times newspaper, BERNAMA
(Malaysian National News Agency), and Australia's Canberra Times newspaper and Radio 6PR (Perth), and resulted in
favorable stories appearing over the next few days in all participating media.
NEAR EAST
• Lebanon: Television station Al-Jadid is not Hezbollah-affiliated, with most of its funding coming from the Gulf and
Libya. Their coverage is also routinely sensationalistic and mirrored Al-Manar's coverage. PAS Beirut clarified aspects of
USG assistance in Haiti to Al-Jadid on January 20. On Saturday January 23, Al-Jadid hosted the PAO for 30 minutes on
morning news talk-show al-Hadath to discuss American relief efforts in Haiti. The PAO was able to address many of the
accusations carried in the Al-Manar report, including the myriad "weapons testing" myths being propagated by Russian
and Venezuelan media outlets. [Post cannot engage directly with Hezbollah television station Al-Manar as it was
designated as a Special Designated Global Terrorist organization in 2006 under E.O. 13224]
• Morocco: On 1/28/10 the nationalist French-language daily L'Opinion published an op-ed entitled, "Haiti: After
terror, the dread..." The paper is generally considered to be fairly hostile to the USG, however, on 1/29/10, PAO Rabat
and an FSN went to L'Opinion to discuss the op-ed. Post was amazed to find the staff, including the writer himself,
accommodating and even apologetic during the meeting. The editor-in-chief immediately agreed that the piece had
been unfair, and the writer somewhat sheepishly explained himself by saying that public opinion had not quite
recovered from "the Bush years," but readily acknowledged as well that the article was not balanced. PAO gave the
writer a dossier of Washington File articles and some information from Infocentral's regular updates, which he promised
to use in writing a counterpoint article. On 2/1/10, L'Opinion published an article entitled, "The massive humanitarian
action of the United States," based on the articles provided by Post. The excellent article underscored the scope of
American assistance, both government and private sector, to aide Haiti's earthquake victims.
• Syria: Syrian state-run media coverage of the USG role in Haiti relief efforts has been largely negative and inaccurate,
portraying the U.S. military as occupying Haiti. Examples include the Ba'ath party's Al-Baath newspaper publishing three
critical articles (1/21/01) under the headlines: "US Crimes in Haiti," "US Military Forces Tighten Grip on Haiti," and "US

Thought you might be interested in this piece by Joe Nye which I believe validates the new approach we are trying to
implement. We have begun to roll-out the new plan and so far the reaction has been reasonably positive. We have
organized a set of working groups around key initiatives --- women's empowerment; cve; expanded English language
training; cultural programming; youth; climate change; etc so that we can incorporate new proposals into FY2012
budget and re-direct FY 2010 and 2011 funds wherever possible and appropriate. The working groups are being chaired
by senior level officers from the regional bureaus --- Bob Blake; Craig Kelly, etc. --- and are being asked to report back

The New Public Diplomacy
Joseph S. Nye <http://www.project-syndicate.org/contributor/422>

CAMBRIDGE — The world of traditional power politics was typically about whose military or economy would win. In
today's information age, politics is also about whose "story" wins.
National narratives are, indeed, a type of currency. Governments compete with each other and with other organizations
to enhance their own credibility and weaken that of their opponents. Witness the contest between the government and

protesters after the Iranian elections in June 2009, in which the Internet and Twitter played crucial roles, or the recent
controversy between Google and China.
Reputation has always mattered in world politics, but credibility has become crucial because of a "paradox of plenty."
When information is plentiful, the scarce resource is attention. Under the new conditions, a soft sell may, more than
ever, prove more effective than a hard sell.
For example, the relative independence of the BBC, sometimes a source of consternation to British governments, has
paid rich dividends in credibility, as illustrated by this account of Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete's day: "he rises at
dawn, listens to the BBC World Service, then scans the Tanzanian press."
Skeptics who treat the term "public diplomacy" as a mere euphemism for propaganda miss the point. Simple
propaganda is counterproductive as public diplomacy. Nor is public diplomacy merely a public-relations campaign. Public
diplomacy also involves building long-term relationships that create an enabling environment for government policies.
The contribution of direct government information to long-term cultural relationships varies with three dimensions or
stages of public diplomacy, and all three are important. The first and most immediate dimension is daily
communications, which involves explaining the context of domestic and foreign-policy decisions. This dimension also
involves preparation for dealing with crises. If there is a vacuum in information after an event, others will rush in to fill it.
The second dimension is strategic communication, which develops a set of simple themes, much as a political or
advertising campaign does. While the first dimension is measured in hours and days, the second occurs over weeks,
months, and even years.
The third dimension of public diplomacy is the development of lasting relationships with key individuals over many years
or even decades, through scholarships, exchanges, training, seminars, conferences, and access to media channels. These
programs develop what the American journalist Edward R. Murrow once called the crucial "last three feet" — face-to-
face communications, with the enhanced credibility that reciprocity creates.
But even the best advertising cannot sell an unpopular product. A communications strategy cannot work if it cuts against
the grain of policy. Actions speak louder than words. All too often, policymakers treat public diplomacy as a bandage
that can be applied after damage is done by other instruments. For example, China tried to enhance its soft power by
successfully staging the 2008 Olympics, but its domestic simultaneous crackdown in Tibet — and subsequent repression
in Xinxiang and arrests of human rights lawyers — undercut its gains.
Great powers try to use culture and narrative to create soft power that promotes their advantage, but they do not
always understand how to do it. Critics in the United States complain that the over-militarization of foreign policy
undercuts its credibility. Instead, they advocate diplomacy "on steroids," staffed by diplomats trained in new media,
cross-cultural communications, granular local knowledge, and networks of contacts with under-represented groups.
The centralized mass-media approach to public diplomacy still plays an important role. Governments need to correct
daily misrepresentations of their policies, as well as to try to convey a longer-term strategic message. The main strength
of the mass-media approach is its audience reach and ability to generate public awareness and set the agenda. But its
weakness is its inability to influence how the message is perceived in different cultural settings. The sender knows what
she says, but not always what the targets hear. Cultural barriers are apt to distort what is heard.
Networked communications, on the other hand, can take advantage of two-way communications and peer-to-peer
relations to overcome cultural differences. This type of decentralization and flexibility is difficult for governments to
accomplish, given their central accountability structures.
The greater flexibility of non-governmental organizations in using networks has given rise to what some call "the new
public diplomacy," which is no longer confined to messaging, promotion campaigns, or even direct governmental

contacts with foreign publics serving foreign-policy purposes. It is also about building relationships with civil-society
actors in other countries and facilitating networks between non-governmental parties at home and abroad.
In this approach to public diplomacy, government policy is aimed at promoting and participating in, rather than
controlling, such cross-border networks. Indeed, too much government control, or even the appearance of it, can
undercut the credibility that such networks are designed to engender. The evolution of public diplomacy from one-way
communications to a two-way dialogue treats publics as co-creators of meaning and communication.
Power in a global information age, more than ever, will include a soft dimension of attraction as well as the hard
dimensions of coercion and payment. Combining these dimensions effectively is called "smart power." For example, the
current struggle against transnational terrorism is a struggle over winning hearts and minds, and over-reliance on hard
power alone is not the path to success.
Public diplomacy is an important tool in the arsenal of smart power, but smart public diplomacy requires an
understanding of credibility, self-criticism, and the role of civil society in generating soft power. If it degenerates into
propaganda, public diplomacy not only fails to convince, but can undercut soft power. Instead, it must remain a two-way
process, because soft power depends, first and foremost, upon understanding the minds of others.

More than a million spectators gathered before the Capitol on a frosty January afternoon to witness the inauguration of
Barack Obama, who promised in his campaign to change Washington's mercenary culture of lobbyists, special interest
influence and backroom deals. But within a few months of being sworn in, the President and his top aides were sitting
down with leaders from the pharmaceutical industry to hash out a deal that they thought would make health care
reform possible.
Over the following months, pharmaceutical industry lobbyists and executives met with top White House aides dozens of
times to hammer out a deal that would secure industry support for the administration's health care reform agenda in
exchange for the White House abandoning key elements of the president's promises to reform the pharmaceutical
industry. They flooded Congress with campaign contributions, and hired dozens of former Capitol Hill insiders to push

their case. How they did it--pieced together from news accounts, disclosure forms including lobbying reports and
Federal Election Commission records, White House visitor logs and the schedule Sen. Max Baucus releases voluntarily
<http://wiki.opencongress.orewiki/Max_Baucus/Schedule> --is a testament to how ingrained the grip of special
interests remains in Washington.
In the 2008 campaign, Obama declared his intention to include all stakeholders as he sought to reform the nation's
health care system, but also supported key Democratic health reform policies
<http://www.barackobama.com/2007/06/16/obama_says_drug_plan_could_say.php> . Among these were several that
targeted the pharmaceutical industry: Allowing re-importation of drugs from first world countries with lower drug prices
and providing Medicare with negotiating authority over prescription drug prices in the recently enacted Part D program.
These weren't just promises, Obama had already voted for both of them as a senator in 2007. (Roll Call Vote 132
<http://www.senate.govilegislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&session=1&vote=00132>
and Roll Call Vote 150
<http://www.senate.govilegislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&session=1&vote=00150> .)
Set to carry out this agenda were two Capitol Hill veterans, schooled in the monied Washington culture, chief of staff
Rahm Emanuel <http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/16/us/politics/16emanuel.html?_r=1> and deputy chief of staff Jim
Messina <http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/20/AR2009022003853.html> . Emanuel
was a former fundraiser, Clinton administration official, investment banker and member of the Democratic leadership in
Congress. Messina was the former campaign manager and chief of staff to the powerful Senate Finance Committee
chairman Max Baucus. Both were known for their unparalleled legislative abilities.
Because of Obama's decision to develop a plan operating through the legislative process, members of Congress also
played key roles. Early on, the pharmaceutical companies were told to deal directly with Senate Finance Committee
chairman Max Baucus <http://www.nytirnes.corn/2009/08/06/health/policy/06insure.html> . Baucus would be the
vehicle for the deal worked out behind the scenes by the White House and PhRMA.
Central to this effort was PhRMA president, CEO and top lobbyist Billy Tauzin, a longtime Democratic member of
Congress who switched party affiliations after Republicans gained control of Congress in 1994. By switching parties
Tauzin was able to maintain his influence and even rose to be Chairman of the House Committee on Energy &
Commerce. Tauzin became the poster child of Washington's mercenary culture. He crafted a bill to provide prescription
drug access to Medicare recipients, one that provided major concessions to the pharmaceutical industry. Medicare
would not be able to negotiate for lower prescription drug costs and reimportation of drugs from first world countries
would not be allowed. A few months after the bill passed, Tauzin announced that he was retiring from Congress and
would be taking a job helming PhRMA for a salary of $2 million.
Tauzin's job change became fodder for a campaign ad that then presidential candidate Barack Obama ran in the spring
of 2008 simply titled "Billy <http://www.youtube.corn/watch?v=NCROOg9CfAw> ." It featured the candidate, sleeves
rolled up, talking to a salon of gasping Americans about the ways of Washington. "The pharmaceutical industry wrote
into the prescription drug plan that Medicare could not negotiate with drug companies. And you know what, the
chairman of the committee, who pushed the law through, went to work for the pharmaceutical industry making $2
million a year." The screen fades to black to inform the viewer that, "Barack Obama is the only candidate who refuses
Washington lobbyist money," while the candidate continues his lecture, "Imagine that. That's an example of the same
old game playing in Washington. You know, I don't want to learn how to play the game better, I want to put an end to
the game playing."
Aiding PhRMA in their outreach to Congress would be a squadron of lobbyists to push their health care reform priorities.
Over the course of 2009, the drug industry trade group spent over $28 million
<http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?Iname.Pharmaceuticak-Rsrch÷%26+Mfrs+of+America&year=2009>
on in house and hired lobbyists. Aside from PhRMA's massive in-house lobbying operation, the trade group hired 48
outside lobbying firms. The total number of lobbyists working for PhRMA in 2009 reached 165. Some 137 of those 165
lobbyists representing PhRMA were former employees of either the legislative or executive branches. Of these dozens
were former congressional staffers including two former chiefs of staff to Max Baucus.
According to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, drug makers contributed huge sums to congressional
campaign committees <http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus.php?ind=H04> during the same period--from
January to the end of October (4th quarter numbers are still being totaled), industry political action committees,
employees and their family members flooded lawmakers with over $8 million. Those contributions tilted heavily to
Democrats over Republicans by a 57 to 42 percent margin--the first time in any election cycle going back to 1990, the

first year that the Center for Responsive Politics began tracking industry giving, that Democrats were so favored. Given
their majorities on Capitol Hill, and the new President's intention to reform America's health care system, the new tilt
was perhaps not surprising.
***
On March 5, the White House held a meeting with major health care industry leaders
<http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/health/jan-june09/healthcare_03-05.htmi> to try to bring them to the table
and see what could be done to gain their support. In attendance were Billy Tauzin, president, CEO and top lobbyist for
PhRMA, Pfizer CEO Jeff Kindler, America's Health Care Plans (AHIP) Chairman Karen Ignani, Tom Donohue of the
Chamber of Commerce and Robert Wood Johnson Foundations' Rise Lavizzomourey. A day before the White House
meeting Tauzin appeared on CNBC
<http://business.theatlantic.com/2009/03/big_pharmas_top_lobbyist_said_what.php> touting health care reform and
promising to work closely with the Obama administration. In the interview he touted it as an "optimistic plan",
acknowledging that the industry did have a few problems but was glad to have a chance to discuss these. Some were
<http://business.theatlantic.com/2009/03/big_pharmas_top_lobbyist._said_what.php> caught dumb-founded

ionalreview.com/postPq=NjQxZjnYTc0ZjM2MDAxMiQ1NDV4NzNhZWEzNjg3YmM=> by this apparent change of heart
on behalf of an industry long adverse to health care reforms.
On April 15, Jim Messina and Jon Selib, chief of staff to Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus, convened a
meeting at the headquarters of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) with leaders of organized labor
and health care groups, including PhRMA. At the meeting, the groups decided to form two nonprofit entities to promote
reform efforts, Healthy Economy Now and Americans for Stable Quality Care, that would be almost entirely funded by
PhRMA <http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1009/28362.html> . The two groups spent $24 million on their
advertising campaigns; the contract to produce and place ads went to White House Senior Advisor David Axelrod's
former firm <http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0809/26240.html> , AKPD, which owed Axelrod $2 million.
In the next month, CEO's from pharmaceutical companies would meet with Baucus and administration officials at least
four times. These talks preceded a major public event at the White House, one critical to its strategy to promote health
care reform. On May 11, PhRMA and other trade industry groups pledged cost cutting measures
<http://cnnmoney.printthis.clickability.cornipt/cpt?action=cpt&title=Flealth+care+groups+propose+$2+trillion+in+cost+
controls±-+May.+11,+200984expire=-

htm&partnerlD=2200> to the White House that would save, they claimed, upwards of $2 trillion over the next decade.
President Obama announced the deal in the State Dining Room, flanked by leaders of the various trade groups; the
administration followed up with a media blitz in the press and on the White House Web site
<http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/Coming-Together-Bringing-Down-Costs/> .
The next day, Healthy Economy Now's PhRMA funded ad campaign ran their first advertisement
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v.
--n0KuoAV6ytO> in support of the health care reform process calling for the
government to finally "fix" the nation's health care cost problems. While many elements of the $2 trillion cost cutting
pledge fell apart, the drug industry remained committed to the process in the hopes that they could ultimately win out
and defeat the provisions they most feared in closed-door meetings with the White House.
The first occurred on June 2. White House visitor logs show PhRMA's top executives, including Tauzin, and industry CEOs
met with Sarah Fenn from the White House Office of Health Care Reform. On the same day, the publicly available
schedule of Senator Max Baucus shows Tauzin and the same industry CEOs met the Senate Finance Committee
chairman. What ultimately resulted from these coordinated meetings would be revealed by Baucus on June 20.
In a press release <http://finance.senate.gov/press/Bpress/2009press/prb062009.pdf> featuring a statement by Tauzin,
Baucus revealed that the pharmaceutical industry had accepted $80 billion in cost cutting measures to be included in the
Senate Finance Committee version of the bill. According to news reports
<http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=BD18F267-18FE-70B2-A8F5960026D227DF> , Baucus initially proposed
$100 billion in cost cutting measures, but the executives and lobbyists meeting on June 2 were able to win the lower
figure.
The terms of the initial cost-cutting deal included $30 billion go directly towards closing the "donut hole" in Medicare
prescription drug coverage. The "donut hole" is a term for the gap in coverage that occurs within the Medicare
prescription drug coverage. For those purchasing prescription drugs through the Medicare program coverage cuts off at

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774008 Date: 08/31/2015
$2,700 spent and does not pick back up again until $6,154 is spent by the participant. The amount proposed in the deal,
50 percent coverage for drugs within the coverage gap, however, would not completely close the "donut hole."
In Baucus' press release, Tauzin is quoted as saying, This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and, working together, we
can make this hope for a better tomorrow a reality today." This "once-in-a-lifetime" opportunity also extended to the
pharmaceutical industry's ability to blunt the long-term Democratic agenda of lowering prescription drug prices through
Medicare negotiations, re-importation and quicker release of generics onto the market. After making such a grand
statement of support through cost cutting proposals it was time for the pharmaceutical industry to finally force the
White House and Democrats to take certain chips off the table.
Baucus proceeded with a plan to convene a bipartisan group
<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/28/us/politics/28baucus.html> in an effort to craft the bill desired by the White
House. These participants included Democrats Kent Conrad and Jeff Bingaman and Republicans Chuck Grassley, Mike
Enzi and Olympia Snowe. Baucus' decision and the need to solidify deals with groups like the pharmaceutical industry -
which were reliant on Baucus producing a bill - slowed down the legislative process making it impossible for Congress to
meet the White House's announced August recess deadline <http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/07/21/obama-
defends-august-dead_n_241755.html> for passing health care reform.
Soon after, PhRMA's big guns and industry lobbyists paid the White House another visit on July 7 and this time met with
Rahm Emanuel and Jim Messina (Baucus' chief of staff Jon Selib is also listed in White House visitor logs for this
meeting). In August, The Huffington Post's <http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/13/internal-memo-confirms-
bi_n_258285.html> Ryan Grim reported on an internal memo that was drafted at that meeting that outlined the policies
that would not be allowed into any final version of health care reform. These included Medicare prescription drug
negotiations, drug re-importation, and the lowering of prices for drugs available through Medicare Part D and Part B.
The deal would be $80 billion in cost cutting and absolutely no more.
***
While the $80 billion deal was cut with Baucus' committee, other congressional committees continued to mark-up their
own versions of health care reform without the knowledge that the White House was relying on Baucus to produce the
final product. In the House of Representatives, the House Energy & Commerce Committee leveled a direct threat to the
$80 billion deal. Energy & Commerce Chair Henry Waxman sought to include all of the provisions that PhRMA had
gotten the White House and Baucus to cut out of the reform bill. These included drug reimportation, Medicare
negotiating power and speedier release of generics to the market. According to previous analysis of the measures
proposed by the committee, these measures would have totaled hundreds of billions in cost cuts, far exceeding the $80
billion cap agreed to by the White House, Baucus and PhRMA.
The cost cutting measures passed in the Energy & Commerce bill spooked the board of PhRMA, which included all of the
CEOs involved in the deal-cutting meetings with the White House and Baucus. The board pressured Tauzin to go public
with the deal to ensure that the White House would recognize it and not renege. On August 4, the Los Angeles Times
<http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/04/nation/na-healthcare-pharma4> , in an exclusive report, featured quotes
from Tauzin claiming that a deal between the White House and PhRMA existed and that, as Tauzin put it, "The White
House blessed it." Tom Hamburger wrote in the article, "For his part, Tauzin said he had not only received the White
House pledge to forswear Medicare drug price bargaining, but also a separate promise not to pursue another proposal
Obama supported during the campaign: importing cheaper drugs from Canada or Europe."
The White House's Jim Messina later confirmed Tauzin's claim, stating, "The president encouraged this approach ... He
wanted to bring all the parties to the table to discuss health insurance reform."
Democratic lawmakers were furious. Rep. Raul Grijalva, chairman of the Progressive Caucus, asked
<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/06/health/policy/06insure.html> , "Are industry groups going to be the ones at the
table who get the first big piece of the pie and we just fight over the crust?"
***
On September 7, Baucus' bill made a private circulation on the Hill; pharmaceutical industry cost-cutting did not exceed
$80 billion. Five days later, the New York Times <http://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/12/drug-makers-plan-
to-back-baucus-plan-with-ad-dollarsh reported that PhRMA planned to spend up to $150 million in an advertising blitz
in support of Baucus' bill. The Times noted that the ad spending "...would be a follow-up to the deal that drug makers
struck in June with Mr. Baucus and the White House." On September 16, Baucus released the full text of his legislation
<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/09/16/health-care-bill-baucus-s_n_288218.html> to the public.
The White House, PhRMA and Baucus still had to fight a few battles to keep the deal intact. The key amendment
targeting the PhRMA deal in committee mark-up came from Sen. Bill Nelson from Florida, which has one of the largest
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774008 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774008 Date: 08/31/2015
Medicare participant populations in the nation. The pull of constituent needs clearly put Bill Nelson into a position to
push for further cost cutting in Medicare prescription drug pricing. His target: closing the "donut hole" completely.
Nelson claimed that his amendment would generate $106 billion in revenue
<http://www.politico.com/livepulse/0909/Nelson_PhRMA_amendment_fails.html> , or from PhRMA's perspective
increase their cost-cutting to $186 billion. That would be unacceptable to PhRMA, to Baucus, to the White House and to
the pharmaceutical industry who had made the deal. Other Senate Democrats, Tom Carper and Robert Menendez voted
with Republicans and Baucus on the committee to defeat the amendment
<http://www.washingtontimes.comfnews/2009/sep/24/panel-fails-overturn-white-house-deal-drugmakers/> . It is little
surprise the Carper's Delaware is home to AstraZeneca and Menendez' New Jersey is home to Merck and Bristol-Myers-
Squibb, all of which lobbied for the $80 billion cap.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid introduced the final bill, with the cap in place, on November 19. Debate began on
Dec. 3, and with it come one more attempt by members to change the terms of the deal. Senator Byron Dorgan
introduced an amendment that would allow for drug re-importation, but as the date for voting drew near, the Federal
Drug Administration (FDA) released a letter <http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/71307-fda-opposes-senate-drug-
importation-amendmen> objecting to the proposal that echoed pharmaceutical industry talking points: "...as currently
written, the resulting structure would be logistically challenging to implement and resource intensive. In addition, there
are significant safety concerns." Dorgan's amendment was defeated
<http://www.politico.com/livepulse/1209/BREAKING_Senate_rejects_Dorgan_amendment.html> with numerous
Democrats previously in support of reimportation switching to "no" votes.
On Christmas Eve, the bill passed the Senate with the PhRMA deal fully intact.
***
New Year's Eve passed with no further action on health care reform. Public opinion regarding the health care reform bill
had been slipping throughout 2009. It reached a fulcrum in the special election to replace the deceased senator Ted
Kennedy in Massachusetts on January 19, 2010. Newly minted senator Scott Brown campaigned that he would be the
senator to provide Republicans with the votes to filibuster the final health care reform bill. Democrats ran for cover.
Despite having the largest majorities of any party since the 1970s, Democrats put the brakes on their agenda,
particularly health care reform.
In the end, the pharmaceutical industry's support for health care reform would be left up in the air . After spending $100
million in advertising in support of legislation that Tauzin and key executives hoped would be a windfall for the
pharmaceutical industry, the legislative process had flat-lined. In February, the board of PhRMA, split over the deal cut
by Tauzin, pushed Tauzin to resign his post <http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/11/health-reform-in-iimbo-
top-drug-lobbyist-quits0partner=rss&emc=rss> .
In an interview with Diane Sawyer
<http://www.politico.comilivepulse/0110/0bama_concedes_talks_raised_legitimate_concerns.html> , President
Obama owed up to failures in the process of passing health care reform, "[T]he health care debate as it unfolded
legitimately raised concerns not just among my opponents, but also amongst supporters that we just don't know what's
going on ... And it's an ugly process and it looks like there are a bunch of back room deals."

Replace Rahm
by Leslie H. Gelb
February 15, 2010 10:48pm
BS Top - Gelb Get Rid of Rahm <http://www.tdbimg.com/files/2010/02/15/img-bs-top---gelb-get-rid-of-
rahm_135707996825.jpg> Kristoffer Tripplaar / SIPA President Obama desperately needs a sweeping staff shakeup to
save his presidency. Leslie H. Gelb on why he must reassign Rahm, dump Larry Summers, and get rid of National Security
adviser Jim Jones.
The negative, even dismissive, talk about the Obama White House has reached a critical point. The president must
change key personnel now. Unless he speedily sets up a new team, he will be reduced to a speechmaker. It's mostly a
matter of relocating the Chicago and campaign crowd who surround the Oval Office and inserting people with proven
records of getting things done in Washington and the world.
To be fair, it's not clear whether the bad judgments on priorities, practicalities, and steadiness come from Mr. Obama or
his White House team. Maybe he overpowers them in discussions, or maybe he gives them a role in policymaking far
beyond their experience in that realm. Unless you're there, you don't know. But Mr. Obama is the president, and except
for the right-wing crazies, most Americans still recognize his great talents and promise. It is he who's got to be helped.
So it is they who've got to go.
It is he who's got to be helped. So it is they who've got to go.
One may quarrel with my sense of urgency here. But it's hard to have a conversation with opinion leaders anywhere—
and especially in Washington—that doesn't descend into ripping Obama's White House team. The refrain of complaints
is always the same:
• Obama is forever taking strong stances only to backfill and trim. Most recently, he said he did not "begrudge" Wall
Streeters their big earnings because that was part of the market system. This, in the face of his saying only a couple of
weeks ago that such big bonuses were "shameful."
• Obama doesn't know what's really going on. Regarding the Middle East, he recently said that "I think it is absolutely
true that what we did this year didn't produce the kind of breakthrough that we wanted, and if we had anticipated some
of these political problems on both sides earlier, we might not have raised expectations as high." He had to be totally
out of it not to realize that the Palestinians and Israelis were nowhere close to sitting down with each other and dealing.
• Obama wants to get along with everyone so badly he doesn't recognize real opposition when he sees it—let alone
know how to deal with it. He emerges from a meeting with congressional Republican leaders on health-care reform and
says he is "an eternal optimist"—when those very same Republican leaders just told the press that they don't see any
common ground and believe the administration has to "scrap the bill and start over."
• It's even hard to follow his latest Afghan policy. He calls Afghanistan a "war of necessity" and orders more than 30,000
new troops there, coupled with an announcement that he'll begin withdrawing some of them in a year plus, only to see
some of his advisers say he will start withdrawals and some say he won't.

I've scribbled similar points in recent months in The Daily Beast. And last week in The Financial Times, Edward Luce
provided <http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b6b4700a-10fb-lldf-9a9e-00144feab49a.html> a thunderclap on Washington's
negative consensus about the incompetence of Obama's Chicago-laden team. Luce named names in the White House,
and a number of journalists and bloggers strikingly failed to link to the Luce story. They were said to fear the wrath of
the Chicagoans. Steve Clemons, author of The Washington Note, essentially endorsed
<http://www.thewashingtonnote.com/archives/2010/02/core_chicago_teh the Luce finding and slapped his fellow
bloggers' wrists for hiding from this issue. The situation is as serious as it was during the Carter administration. There,
two very capable political campaigners—Hamilton Jordan and Jody Powell—moved into critical White House positions
without knowing very much about doing business in Washington. And they were, quite naturally, too busy to learn. They
also added to the "them" versus "us" (Washington insiders and bureaucrats versus the regular guys from Georgia)
mentality that plagues most administrations.
The Chicagoans and others "guarding" the president create their own "us versus them" world. It's hard to imagine a
policy conversation between the president and the Chicago crowd, since none of them, except Rahm Emanuel, has
Washington or policy experience. And there isn't much evidence that they bring in strong-minded outsiders to challenge
the president on a regular basis either. The result is an inexperienced president advised by an inexperienced team.
Here are the personnel changes being bruited about in political and policy circles: First, remove Rahm Emanuel as chief
of staff and move him to a senior political adviser slot. No one I've talked to believes he has the management skills and
discipline to run the White House. But he is a terrific political mind and a fighter and should be given the new job and
the time to do his thing. Proven pros who could step right in include the following: Erskine Bowles, president of the
University of North Carolina and former Clinton chief of staff; Leon Panetta, now CIA director and formerly White House
chief as well under Clinton; Sylvia Mathews, a former deputy chief of staff also under Clinton; and John Podesta, another
former Clinton chief who now heads the Center for American Progress. All four are tough and know how to manage.
Replace Lawrence Summers, director of the White House's National Economic Council, with Paul Volcker, the former
chairman of the Federal Reserve. Summers is brilliant and highly controversial; he's been beaten up and is said to want
out anyway. Volcker has unmatched stature, practical experience, and the courage of a lion. He is the only one now in a
position to get down to step-by-step brass tacks on the economy and stop Mr. Obama's weekly gyrations. Others with
proven track records who can help as inside or outside advisers are: Stephen Robert, formerly head of Oppenheimer,
Vincent Mai, former leader of AEA Investors, and Tom Hill of Blackstone. There are also two economic stars in
Washington who'd improve both policymaking and public combat: Sheila Bair, chairwoman of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, and Elizabeth Warren, chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel. One outside adviser above all
would help the president see the economic hard choices ahead: Peter G. Peterson, accomplished businessman and
policy head.
David Axelrod, the senior political adviser to the president, needs to concentrate on the next presidential campaign,
wherein his expertise lies, and not on domestic and foreign policy, where he is just another smart unknowledgeable
voice. Good replacements who do know the politics of Washington would be the aforementioned Podesta; and Tom
Daschle, the former Democratic Senate Majority Leader. As for David Plouffe, another senior campaign aide, now in
unofficial residence at the White House, he should be lodged in the nearby Executive Office Building. Senior adviser and
Chicago buddy Valerie Jarrett is too much a part of the inner circle to move, but she should be given a more limited role
in making policy.
Mr. Obama's crowd appears to think that getting things done means his giving another speech. It's nice, but not nearly
enough.
Robert Gibbs needs a rest from being press secretary. Let's put it this way: He wasn't born for daily jousts with pithy
Republicans. His job calls for memorable and pointed phrases and attacks, not circle-the-wagon circumlocutions.
Possible successors? Try Doyle McManus of the L.A. Times, Jake Tapper of ABC News, or Helene Cooper of The New York
Times.
Last but not least, James Jones, the National Security Adviser, has to move on. The career Marine was greatly admired
and respected as Commandant of the Corps and as NATO's military chief. He handled those duties with great skill. But by
wide acclamation inside and outside the White House, he has not emerged as a strategist—perhaps the key requirement
of this key position. The person in that job has to pull everything together—laying out achievable objectives and precise
plans to dispense carefully packaged carrots and sticks. One Democrat who could step in now, despite his age, is
Zbigniew Brzezinski, Jimmy Carter's national-security adviser. He has a first-rate strategic mind—a rare quality—and
knows how to deliver results. Obama will need to iron out Zbig's lack of sympathy toward Israel and Russia.

Also available are a boatload of first-class retired diplomats with the judgment and background needed to perform the
National Security Council job effectively. They would be greeted with applause both at home and abroad. Try former
ambassadors Thomas Pickering, Morton Abramowitz, Frank Wisner, Reginald Bartholomew, and Winston Lord. They
have it all. At a minimum, they and others like them should form the core of a group that meets regularly with Obama
on strategy.
Yes, many of the pros suggested above have reached their golden years. But 70 and even 80 are the new 60. They all
possess the necessary energy, experience and rare skill in delivering results. They are also shovel-ready. As a critical
bonus, they could and would mentor the next generation down, a very talented one indeed, to succeed them in two or
three years. To lead America and the world, Obama has to grow far beyond his present propensity to treat problems as
intellectual puzzles—to collect facts and hear the arguments. The great tasks of governing demand proven intuition in
sensing what's achievable, which buttons to push when, how to buy the time for power to take hold, how to make
adjustments without flagrantly foolish rhetoric, how to avoid failures that only diminish power, and how to succeed in
small as well as large ways. With a team versed in such arts and skills, President Obama and America would succeed.

Re: Iran, Saudi
Had dinner last night (Tuesday, February 16) with Joschka Fischer. We had an interesting conversation on Iran and Saudi
Arabia, among other things. (As you know Fischer is now director of the Nabucco pipeline project.) On Iran, harsh,
targeted sanctions are absolutely necessary, but are most effective diplomatically when always coupled with an offer to
negotiate. The iron fist in the velvet glove approach achieves several objectives: According to Fischer's intelligence,
Ahmanijehad wished some negotiated settlement but was blocked. The regime has splits at the top. Perhaps true,
perhaps not. But constantly pushing negotiations alongside sanctions puts additional pressure on internal divisions,
whatever they are. Extending an open hand while brandishing a stick closes diplomatic and political room to maneuver
for Iran. Its refusal to accept the open hand justifies application of the stick. Even when sanctions are enforced it always
remains useful to say another way is open. The damage done to Iran is therefore the result of its own choice. This
approach also aids the opposition. A purely condign sanctions strategy can contribute to the regime's will to punish and
tighten repression. Talking of regime change, of course, undermines the cause of regime change. It is a gift to the
regime. The opposition is a new factor in the Iran equation that must be taken into account on the political and moral
level. Pushed to the wall, the regime may feel compelled to repress, which might involve thousands or tens of thousands
of political, killings. On Saudi Arabia, Fischer points out that if Iran develops nuclear weaponry the Saudis already have
their own bomb. The Saudis invested in Pakistan's nuclear weaponry partly for this eventuality; that's their bomb in
reserve.

Former aide urges Obama to regain 'political narrative'
By Edward Luce in Washington
Published: February 15 2010
Barack Obama, US president, has lost control of the political narrative and needs to make more use of his cabinet in
order to regain it, says John Podesta, the man who headed the president's transition team.
"My friends in the White House would agree with this, that they lost the narrative," Mr Podesta said in an interview for
View from DC, the Financial Times' video series from Washington. "Clearly that needs not one speech once in a while: it

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774069 Date: 08/31/2015
needs, I think, to be constantly reinforced. And not just by the president, but by his entire team ... He's got a terrific
cabinet. Use it. Get out into the country and use it."
Mr Podesta, who was also a chief of staff to Bill Clinton, drew parallels with the former president's difficulties in his first
two years, which culminated in the 1994 Republican takeover of Congress following the failure of healthcare reform.
When asked whether the failure of this latest attempt at healthcare reform would result in a similar electoral
"massacre" for the Democratic party at the mid-term elections in November, he said: "I subscribe to that view."
Mr Podesta founded the Centre for American Progress, Washington's largest liberal think-tank, which was often
described as a "government-in-exile" during the years George W. Bush was in the White House. He said Mr Obama had
three options with healthcare reform. First, try to enact the whole thing by using the budget reconciliation process,
which would enable it to pass with 51 votes. The Democrats lost their controlling 60-seat super-majority last month in a
election defeat in Massachusetts.
The second would be to pass a watered down bill with Republican support. The third would be to abandon the attempt,
as Mr Clinton did in 1993.
Mr Podesta, whom Mr Obama still regularly consults, said there was still a better than 50:50 chance of getting reform
through. "The worst option among the three is doing nothing, and so they're going to have to figure out which track is
viable," he said. "It may mean doing it with only Democratic votes. But if that is such, then so be it."
He painted a fairly bleak view of the overall health of US politics. "It sucks," he said. Pointing to a strategy of
obstructionism by Republican lawmakers, he said: "I think the president is trying to re-engage with Republicans, but,
quite frankly, he's not dealing with the party of [Abraham] Lincoln. He's dealing with the party of [Sarah] Palin."
The growth of partisanship and the increasing difficulty in getting any big reforms through the Senate were threatening
to turn the US into, "in essence, a parliamentary system without majority rule", where the opposition automatically
opposes any serious initiatives.
The political stasis in California provided the writing on the wall for the US as a whole, he said. Since the 1978 passage of
Proposition 13 in the state, all budget changes had required a two-thirds majority. "And so nothing gets done."

I thought your designation of Iran as a near military government was very good. Gary Sick has been arguing that it is in
fact a military government. Of course this is predicate for targeted sanctions. There is a consistent thread in the
challenges we face from a host of authoritarian (and totalitarian) military governments, sometimes loosely allied on an
ad hoc basis--Iran, China, Myanmar, Venezuela, Cuba. This is nothing like the Cold War, but it's an idea worth exploring,
not publicly discussing, but thinking about.
On Justice Jim, a couple of thoughts: I wish his tragic end were as politically conclusive as that of Edmund Ruffin, the
Southern fire-eater and secessionist who was given the honor of firing the first shot at Fort. Sumter and upon hearing of
Appomattox carefully sat himself down in his grand Charleston house and blew his brains out with a shotgun.
Unfortunately, the evil Justice Jim did lives on--in the wild bigotry against Obama and even through the Supreme Court
decision in the case of Citizens United, a group he helped galvanize to circulate the Whitewater hoax.

Supreme Court Justice Jim Johnson, known both for his segregationist political
activities in the 1950s and dabbling in the political campaign against Bill
Clinton during his presidency, died yesterday.
A Faulkner County sheriff's office spokesman, Lt. Matt Rice, said Johnson was
found dead in his home about 10 a.m. Saturday with an apparently self-inflicted
chest wound from a .30-30 rifle. Johnson had been beset by medical problems, he
said. Roller-McNutt Funeral Home in Conway will be handling arrangements.
He was 85. Here's a standard biographical history <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_D._Johnson>
. This will end his prolific and pointed letters to the editor (unless some are
still in the pipeline), delivered on stationery marked with his name for his
Conway home, "White Haven."
Justice Jim was a courtly man and lively company, gracious in social interaction
with friend and political foe. But Mark Anthony's words in Julius Caesar about
men's deeds come, unavoidably, to mind. As recently as 1990, he worked in an
effort to preserve state Amendment 44, the states rights amendment aimed at
curbing integration that was his brainchild. It had long been declared
unconstitutional by federal courts and was barely repealed by voters.

I get these reports every morning. They are somewhat painful to read since, as you know, in Pakistan, the media can be
particularly outrageous. However, we can't ignore the fact that these talk shows are the most watched programming in
prime time.. The report below is fairly typical. The host sets up the discussion in fairly provocative way and the guests,
who come from across the political spectrum, respond. As you can see, the first commentator is strongly anti US.
However, what I have observed since our media offensive began last Fall is that there is usually a more moderate guest
as well, who will argue along the lines that it is only natural for the US to protect its interests and GOP should do a better
job of protecting Pakistan. Believe it or not there have even been instances where we get credit for some of the things
we do. Also on occasion where there have been particularly egregious attacks on US policy, the host will read a
statement from our Embassy in the following programming. We try to get airtime on these programs whenever
possible but it is hard. It 's a hard slog getting this right but we are making progress.

the role of a frontline state in the war against terrorism while, on the other, it has signed nuclear deal with our worst
enemy, India. What, in your opinion, is the real U.S. agenda in our region?
Munawwar Hassan: The U.S. wants to make India the mini-superpower in this region. This American policy prompted the
Indian army chief to boast that his country can fight against China and Pakistan simultaneously. The U.S. needs our
cooperation against Iran and China. It also wants our help to occupy the resources of the Central Asian states. The
current wave of extremism in the region is the reaction of imperialistic policies of Washington. Despite our recognition
of the Taliban government in Afghanistan, Pakistan treated their ambassador in Islamabad in a very humiliating manner.
In fact, our rulers have becomes the slaves of the United States. But Pakistan will get nothing by befriending the U.S. and
helping Americans in their conspiracies against our neighbors. The history tells us that Washington's enmity is
dangerous, and its friendship is fatal.
Shahid Amin: Every country devises its policies to safeguard its national interests and same is true for the United States.
However, it is the responsibility of our governments to protect Pakistan's interests while dealing with Americans. Today,
the Taliban and Al-Qaeda constitute the biggest threat to the U.S. security. But these terrorist organizations also pose a
potential threat to the security and integrity of Pakistan. Hence, like America, their elimination is also in our own
national interest.

See bottom of message re the firsts.
These were innovations we pushed (particularly use of web for real time display of pledges and what initially was
described by those who did not like my idea as pay to play (or in this instance as I argued - it was pay to have a priority
speaking slot as those who did not have a pledge would get to speak, just not until the end).
Nice addition to our innovation and tech storyline.

Dear members of Team Pledge Data,
I wanted to thank all of you for your excellent work leading up and at the Conference in establishing the system for
gathering, scrubbing, presenting, projecting, and posting the pledge data from all the donors. And to thank you for
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774355 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774355 Date: 08/31/2015
accommodating so quickly my inchoate and sleep-deprived requests yesterday morning for the changes to the format of
what was projected.
But I wanted to make sure you realized that you accomplished something rather historic yesterday. You have
massively raised the bar for future donors' conference on how pledge data should be tracked and shared.
Here are some of the "firsts" that you should be proud of (based at least on my experience in 8 major donors'
conferences so far):
First to gather written pledges from all donors
First to project individual pledges in real time at the conference
First to release individual pledges to the world public and media on the same day as the conference
In addition to these, the work that you put into scrubbing the pledges — with the rigor and integrity of development
professionals — ensured that the pledge figures were more meaningful and accurate than for most other pledging
conferences (another possible first).
All of these achievements are great in themselves, but they will be most important in their impact on ensuring that the
pledged assistance actually makes in to the people of Haiti. This is really just the beginning of that important effort, and
you will be playing a critical role in it — but you have set us off with the best possible starting point for that effort.
Thank you again. It has been and will remain for me a pleasure for me to work with you. Best regards, Roland
Please pass this on to others on the team that I have missed in this email.

Subject: Reminder: WaPo Call re Bob Barnett
Gentle reminder about the Bob Barnett profile he emailed you about. Story is being written by David Montgomery of the
Washington Post, and is slated to run tomorrow - so we need to do this today, the earlier the better.
All you have to do is call into Ops when you're ready, they will connect you to the reporter (and add me in)
Here's the reporters description on the piece: "...a large profile of Bob Barnett for the Style section. I know Barnett has
been a friend and counselor and campaign supporter over the years. I would like to ask Secretary Clinton her estimation
of what makes Barnett good at what he does, what he has meant to her in the various ways he has worked for her over
the years. And I would like to ask what she makes of how such a committed Democrat as Barnett is able to work so well
in his professional life for noted Republicans on book projects and other work. (A theme of the piece is how some say
Barnett harkens to a mythic time in Washington when players supposedly could more readily have relationships with
other side, even while sticking to principles in their political work)"
You have talked about Bob many times, but general points:

U.S.-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue Media Summary
The U.S.-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue dominated Pakistani media on March 24 and March 25. All major English and Urdu
language networks carried live the Secretary and Foreign Minister Qureshi's remarks at the opening session. On
Thursday morning, nearly all television networks led with coverage of the joint press availability. All major English and
Urdu language dailies featured the talks on their front pages, highlighting the Secretary's announcement of $125 million
in aid to Pakistan's energy sector. Reporting was straight-forward with favorable headlines: Dawn—"U.S, Pakistan
pledge to boost and broaden ties" and "U.S. to provide $125m for energy, power plants"; The News—"US vows to boost
energy, defence, trade ties"; Nawa-i-Waqt—"U.S. will neither abandon nor dictate to Pakistan"; The Nation—"New day'
for US, Pakistan: Hillary." Media highlighted the positive shift in U.S.-Pakistan relations, echoing Secretary Clinton's
statement that the talks are the beginning of a new chapter. Reports also focused on the question of nuclear
cooperation and U.S. engagement in the Kashmir dispute; however the U.S. position on these issues had been widely
reported by the media prior to the Dialogue. The Nation published an editorial, entitled "Negative starting note,"
criticizing the talks before they began. The daily stated that "promises will be made on some issues, including on nuclear
cooperation, which will not see fruition." Other editorials stressed the need for a sustained commitment on both sides,
beyond March 24, to produce results: Dawn –"Prospects for Pak-US ties," and Daily Times—"Pak-US Strategic
Dialogue." End Summary.

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON
IRAQI NATIONAL ELECTIONS
I congratulate all the people of Iraq who participated in national elections today and over the past three days. There is
no better rebuke to the violent extremists who seek to derail Iraq's progress. Our thoughts and prayers are with the
families who lost friends and loved ones, and we salute the determination of the Iraqi people to reaffirm their
commitment to democracy and to charting their own future free of fear and intimidation.
Thanks to the efforts of the Iraq High Electoral Commission and the Iraqi Security Forces, which organized the voting and
ensured security at thousands of polling sites throughout the country, Iraqi men and women from all parts of the
country were able to go to the polls and choose their leaders freely.
I also would like to commend Ambassador Hill, General Odierno and all the U.S. civilian and military personnel who
supported this historic effort.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774566 Date: 08/31/2015
Iraqis have chosen a new government to lead their country at a critical time. In the coming months, we will work
together with Iraqi leaders as our partnership continues its transition to a primarily civilian focus, with the goal of
building a long-term, multidimensional relationship between our two nations - a relationship that will contribute to
stability in the Middle East and growing peace and prosperity in Iraq.

a) aware of the basis for what I'd heard, b) to share my assessment/concern (though asked me to elaborate, which I did
vividly), and c) prepared to make sure that whatever ready to be is said publicly - and whatever happens diplomatically -
put the kibosh on the version as it came to me.
Incidentally, unbidden by me on both points-i.e., volunteering-he went out of his way to says upbeat things about you
and downbeat things about OMF. Said he wanted to discuss that with me in person. I said nothing of substance, except
always glad to talk.
Over and out, tho would appreciate you're confirming receipt, since I'm not cc'ing anyone on this.
Cha-cha-cha (even though you're not going to Argentina-and rightly so).

US civilians battle to help Afghanistan
By Matthew Green
Published: March 5 2010 22:43 I Last updated: March 5 2010 22:43
US State Department representative Christopher Harich (top left) and Kevin Melton flank Haji Abdul Jabar as they
discuss the restoration of a religious monument
Each morning this winter, Haji Abdul Jabar has packed a flask of home-brewed green tea for work. It's not frugality; he's
trying to avoid being poisoned. You can't be too careful: before leaving the house, he also straps a Smith & Wesson 9mm
handgun into a holster secreted in the depths of his robes. Seized with occasional fits of passion, Jabar has been known
to whip out the gun during meetings. He may be jumpy, but tactics like this are not entirely out of place in his line of
work: as district governor, the 65-year-old has an unenviable task — of wresting the Arghandab River Valley, one of the
most dangerous places in Afghanistan <http://www.ft.com/world/asiapacific/afghanistan>, from the Taliban.
Viewed from the roof of Jabar's district headquarters, the sweep of the valley is at once beautiful — bleakly majestic -
and charged with menace. A distant range of low, dun-coloured hills defines the valley's opposite flank. Orchards of
pomegranate trees, their branches stripped bare by the cold, line the banks of a river meandering across the valley floor,
dividing the east side of Arghandab from the west.
The district governor's office
The east is where Jabar's office is perched, and where US troops feel safer — it's the west side they call "bad juju land".
Insurgents use a strip of desert there to infiltrate Kandahar, the birthplace of the Taliban in the mid-1990s, and the pivot
on which previous Afghan wars have turned. Roadside bombs hidden in the lush vineyards last year turned Arghandab
into a killing field. A battalion of the 82nd Airborne Division deployed here in mid-December is hoping for better luck,
but a new showdown is coming. Stanley McChrystal <http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/30b0c4d8-091f-11df-ba88-
00144feabdc0.html> , the Nato commander in Afghanistan, has vowed to secure Kandahar. The Taliban want it back.
One night, one of the insurgents called the governor's mobile. "He said, `I'm going to kill you, you're working for the
Americans," says Jabar, sitting on the carpet in his office. "I said, 'Do whatever you can do.' Then I abused him and hung
up." Jabar normally cuts a rather solemn figure. At this -recollection, he laughed.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774593 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774593 Date: 08/31/2015
Jabar is not alone in his mission. Aside from the 2-508 battalion of the 82nd Airborne, two Americans have arrived
<http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6f824828-183b-11df-9256-00144feab49a.html> in Arghandab to help out: 27-year-old
Kevin Melton and 35-year-old Christopher Harich. They're part of the Obama administration's "civilian surge
<http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ee3ee108-d60f-11de-b8Of-00144feabdc0.html> ", announced alongside a fresh build-up
of US troops.
Working out of the whitewashed, two-storey district office, this unlikely trio aims to turn the tide of opinion in the
district. They must do it before spring, when the valley will come into leaf and the Taliban fighters return from Pakistan
in time for the fighting season.
"Arghandab is the gate to Kandahar city," Jabar says. "If Arghandab is lost, Kandahar is also lost. It's the most important
valley in Afghanistan."
Haji Abdul Jabar and Kevin Melton of US Aid above the Arghandab Valley
Jabar, Harich and Melton have little in common but their beards. Melton, who grew up in the suburbs of Washington, is
working for USAid, the US government's development agency <http://www.usaid.gov/> . Hard-driving and -anxious to
get results, Melton juggles a raft of plans for projects from solar-powered lamps for villages, to schemes for
hydroelectricity and renovating a shrine clinging to a nearby mountainside. His past experience includes work in Sudan,
but the challenge in Arghandab trumps anything he has previously attempted. "It feels like there's no end to the day,"
he said. "It's physically, mentally, emotionally and intellectually exhausting."
Harich is a lawyer and a former marine from Louisiana who until recently worked as a policy adviser to the governor of
West Virginia. He now represents the US State Department in Arghandab. "I've no doubt in my mind that we're going to
have a fight this summer," he says. "When the Taliban come back in May, are they welcomed with open arms?"
Strapping on their khaki-coloured helmets and flak jackets and donning wraparound protective sunglasses whenever
they leave the base, Melton and Harich bear a distinct resemblance to the US soldiers who protect them.
Jabar, meanwhile, sports neck and wrist pouches containing Koranic charms to ward off the health risks caused by his
high blood pressure. (He takes advantage of the medic in the US military base adjacent to his office for regular check-
ups.)
Both the Americans were lured by the challenge of participating in the US adventure in Afghanistan for a year. Sleeping
in vacant rooms in the district office and equipped with a V-Sat Internet link to keep in touch with superiors in Kandahar
city — but no shower — they must figure out how to work with Jabar to build local government more or less from scratch.
Harich aims to act as a "mentor", helping Jabar as he works with the -provincial government in Kandahar to assemble an
administrative team to govern the district of more than 55,000 people.
There are few tougher places than Arghandab, a valley where a procession of armies have been bloodied. First came the
British in the 19th -century, then the Russians in the 1980s, and then last year, the 1-17 -battalion of the 5th Stryker
Brigade lost 21 soldiers in five months of -fighting — one of the highest casualty rates any US unit has suffered in
Afghanistan since 2001.
Conscious of the rapid approach of the fighting season, Melton is drawing up plans for projects — such as rehabilitating
schools and clinics — that could quickly demonstrate to the locals the benefits of siding with the government of Hamid

Karzai, Afghanistan's president. He works closely with army officers to ensure the military's own plans to implement
projects fit in with the wider, albeit still embryonic, attempts to bolster Jabar.
The trio's schemes can seem like pin-pricks set against the implacable valley below. So far, progress has been largely
confined to Jabar's office. Since arriving late last year, Melton and Harris have renovated the district centre, installing air
conditioners, curtains and carpets.
Jabar, who rarely ventured to his office from his home in Kandahar before these changes, now turns up almost every
day, driving the 30-minute commute in his battered white Toyota Corolla saloon with three police bodyguards,
-constantly wary of the risk of ambush. "Getting the building is easy," says Harich. "Getting a governor to come in and do
some work is a little harder."
A trickle of men with beards and turbans arrive each morning and sit along the wall of the building waiting for Jabar to
arrive, shielding their eyes from the sun as it crests the crags. They come to apply for government identity cards or
attend a weekly council — or shura — to discuss projects planned by Melton. "The fact that they're even discussing this
stuff is mind-boggling," he says. "They're saying, 'I can come to somebody to do something. This is what government is
about: I can air my grievances to somebody other than the Taliban.'"
And yet Jabar is the first to admit that his writ does not run much -further than the building. "I don't trust the people, so
I don't go out much," he says. "They may try to shoot me."
Vehicles out on night patrol
It can be tempting to measure progress in the west's war in Afghanistan in terms of damage to the Taliban — whether in
capturing the movement's leaders or driving back their fighters on the battlefield. Last month, headlines were
dominated by the arrest of Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar <http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f4f14de4-1b09-11df-88fa-
00144feab49a.html> , the Taliban's second-in-command, and by the big Nato offensive in the town of Marjah
<http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c8d82998:1411-11df-8847-00144feab49a.html> . But even if more Mullah Baradars are
arrested, more military pushes launched, the Taliban may simply bide their time before once more exploiting alienation
from the corrupt or absent government. The only way to stop that is to undertake the painstaking work of stitching
together a government capable of providing more security and services than the "shadow governments" set up by the
insurgents.
Western countries have been talking for years, of course, about building governance in Afghanistan, but men such as
Melton and Harich represent a renewed commitment. US officials say more than 900 US civilian officers are active in
Afghanistan, compared with just 300 at the start of 2009, with more than 50 destined for Kandahar province. The hope
is that this team can deliver a one-two punch that long seemed elusive by exploiting military victories to nurture
functioning local government. "We have to fix governance in some nominal way or this victory won't stick," says a senior
US official. But the sheer scale of the task in Arghandab alone reveals the enormity of the challenge.
One afternoon, Harich sat with the governor on the office carpet for a lunch of stone-baked bread and spinach. As they
talked, Jabar raised repeated requests: for bars of Dove soap, for boots for his bodyguards. The demands seemed
reasonable enough but Harich did not immediately acquiesce. Part of his job is using the Americans' ability to open and
close the aid taps to get Jabar to live up to their vision of an impartial, honest governor. But Jabar, like Afghan leaders at
all levels of government, relies on a patronage system in which his friends expect to be rewarded and where the barrier
between public and private money is porous.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774593 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774593 Date: 08/31/2015
Like much of Afghanistan's political class, Jabar's "legitimacy" comes from his role as a Mujahideen fighter in the 1980s,
battling Soviet -invaders. (Arghandab witnessed heavy fighting: the Russians mounted a month-long siege but never
took the valley.) Although governors in Afghanistan's 34 provinces have the power — in theory — to nominate district
governors, US intelligence officers say Jabar owes his pre-eminence to the backing of Karimullah, the young leader of the
Alakozai, an ethnic Pashtun sub-tribe dominant in the valley.
Said Amir Mohammad Agha, whose refusal to recognise Jabar's authority keeps the valley divided
Divisions between clans mean that Jabar is by no means a consensus candidate. In particular, Said Amir Mohammad
Agha <http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/54cf9eca-10e5-11df-9a9e-00144feab49a.html> , the single-most influential man on
the west side of the river, resents him. US officers say Agha was once detained in Guantanamo Bay as a suspected
Taliban commander. As long as Agha refuses to recognise Jabar's authority, the valley will remain divided.
Even on the east side, to the frustration of Melton and Harich, Jabar has yet to prove he can garner much legitimacy.
Locals milling around his office mutter accusations that he skims off salaries for the few district officials who turn up to
work and steers US reconstruction contracts towards his friends. "He's not a good man, he wants money and bribes,"
said one, reflecting comments from several visitors.
Jabar vigorously denies such allegations — indeed, they were linked to one pistol-waving incident in a meeting with the
Americans. Yet such behaviour would not be unusual in Afghanistan, where bribery lubricates the patronage-based
system that Karzai and past leaders have used to hold the ethnically diverse country together. The dilemma runs
through the entire project in Afghanistan. Western officials want to impose a template of efficient administration, but to
do this they have little choice but to work with leaders who rely on the traditional system to survive.
In Kandahar, the dilemma is acute. Afghanistan's centralised system means that Jabar is dependent on the provincial
government based in the city to send officers to fill his largely empty building, but only a few have materialised. Indeed,
Alakozai elders believe rivals from Karzai's Popalzai tribe are exploiting official positions in Kandahar to accumulate
political and economic influence at their expense.
There is a deeper tension. US officials often speak of putting an "Afghan face" on their work. They want to make it seem
as if local leaders are behind improvements to bolster their standing in the eyes of their people. Yet the talk of
appearances is a tacit recognition that the enterprise is, to some extent, founded on creating an illusion of an Afghan
government at work, in the hope that a real administration will rapidly follow. Can such an approach succeed? Assessing
this is hard when even venturing into the valley is a potentially life-threatening undertaking.
The risk of attack in Arghandab is so high that during a recent week in January, Melton and Harich barely ventured from
the base — apart from a brief trip in an armoured convoy to catch up with superiors in Kandahar city. Soldiers of the
82nd Airborne tend to get closer to the locals. Even a short trip out into the east side of the valley shows how close at
hand the Taliban are, and how hard it will be to persuade people that they are safe enough to side with Jabar.
The soldiers leave the base in high-wheeled armoured vehicles called Cougar M-Raps — designed to resist roadside
bombs. Lieutenant Ryan Christmas, a reassuringly experienced veteran of the 82nd, gives a briefing on where the convoy
should go if it gets hit by an IED. "Call out what you see, gunners stay vigilant in what you're doing," he yells at his men,
-clustered around him before departure. "If it looks wrong and smells wrong, it -probably is wrong."

From the bullet-proof window, a procession of mud homes that seem to grow organically from the valley floor rolled
past. A few weeks before, a man had pulled out a pistol and shot and wounded two Afghan policemen near the road.
These days, insurgents are targeting foot patrols to make it more dangerous to try to build up a rapport with locals.
Sgt Donny Kuehner takes tea with Haji Jhapour
At a US outpost at a village called Sakari Bagh, Sergeant Donny -Kuehner, a 23-year-old from southern California, led a
patrol through a bazaar of ramshackle stalls selling blotchy bunches of bananas dangling from strings and stacked cans
of Power Stag — "World's Finest Quality Motor Oil". Removing his helmet, Kuehner entered a petrol station owned by
Haji Jhapour—the unofficial king of the bazaar whose assistant served green tea. An Afghan policeman wearing
mascara and a yellow bandana round his neck joined the circle as the two men talked, via an interpreter.
"How do people in the bazaar feel about us being here?" Kuehner asked.
"The people in the bazaar are good people, they're busy doing business," Jhapour replied.
"You heard anything lately about any kind of Taliban anywhere, or anything?" Kuehner asked.
"I'm so busy with my business, I don't have time to follow the Taliban — this is the job of the police," Jhapour said,
gesturing to the man with the mascara. "When people come here and buy petrol I sometimes hear news. If I hear
anything, I'll let you know."
As he walked back into the base, Kuehner confessed it was hard to know where local loyalties lay. Some of the labourers
busy filling barriers with earth to build up the outpost's defences had been beaten by Taliban fighters. "The locals are
the key to all this," Kuehner said. "Getting them on our side — if we could do that — it would be leaps and bounds from
where we are now."
Such ambiguous encounters are the stuff of the daily grind of counter-insurgency, where building relationships is critical.
After gradually -adopting such an approach to fight the insurgency in Iraq, the US military is honing its skills in
Afghanistan. But it is clear that soldiers can only do so much: unless a viable government emerges, their presence will
have scant lasting impact. As the US faces the risk of increasingly messy conflicts in parts of Asia, Africa and the Middle
East, building governance just after the fighting will be increasingly decisive.
Critics of the approach believe the US is being sucked into an open-ended "nation-building" exercise in Afghanistan.
Barack Obama has been careful to downplay such suggestions <http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5f6ce026-df6d-11de-98ca-
00144feab49a.html> , though in Arghandab, the -distinction is blurry.
Locals at work on a US combat outpost
On the mountainside near the governor's office, women climb winding steps to a shrine set high above the valley. They
whisper wishes into stones, wrap them in shimmering cloth and hang them from a pole planted in the tomb of the saint.

The site feels forlorn. Fountains cascading down the rocks have run dry. A restaurant with a panoramic view, film-set
staircases and ornamental trees lies abandoned. Turquoise tiles on the mausoleum dome are cracked.
Clad in their body armour, Melton and Harich take a tour with the -governor one afternoon. Melton wants to see the
restaurant reopen — if a new owner can be found. There is talk of installing a pump to make the fountains flow. In the
valley, a pair of US helicopters pirouette, scanning for insurgents. As the trio ambles about, an explosion sounds far off
on the valley floor. It sends up a puff of grey smoke. Talk of renovation jars with the reality that the fighting season will
soon resume — and the window to get anything done is closing fast.
There is one surprise. One morning, Agha, the retired Taliban commander from the west side, decided to pay a visit. An
enigmatic figure, he clutched prayer beads and produced a certificate from US forces saying he had been imprisoned for
four months in 2004 but no longer posed a threat. He seemed to want Jabar and his crowd to know this. Should he
decide to work with them, US officers hope for an easier year.
Perhaps the influx of troops and resources committed by Washington may encourage men like Agha to reconsider their
loyalties. But after 30 years of war, building institutions will be harder. Both the US civilians and military in Arghandab
were doing their best to help Jabar establish a -government. But all participants seemed conscious that even their best
efforts might not be enough. When Melton and Harich leave, there are no guarantees that Jabar will prosper.
In his waistcoat pocket, the governor keeps a tin of green chewing tobacco, a medallion for "excellence" given to him by
the soldiers of the ill-fated 1-17, and a hand-written letter from Afghanistan's intelligence service warning of a Taliban
death threat. "Every day they are killing someone," he said. Then he climbed once more into his Toyota to brave the
road back to -Kandahar once more, taking his empty tea flask and his gun.

Hi Jake,
You'll see that the Secretary's points for Ashton mention the idea of our sending an inter-agency expert team to Brussels
for the next few months to improve US-EU coordination on Iran sanctions prep. EU officials had been receptive, but
now the bureaucrats are saying this would be "counter-productive", and instead prefer more regular videoconferences.
Which is probably OK. Anyway, I just wanted you to know the background, in case it comes up in the Ashton meeting.

Here are a few odds and ends:
Since I'm going to the Bahrain Manama Conf in December, I want to decide where else I might go. The. climate conf in
Mexico will be held Nov 29-Dec 10. There is also a Dec 10 conf on trafficking in Luxor sponsored by Mrs. Mubarak that
Melanne hopes I could attend.
Add to list of meetings the following--
Ron Kirk
Hilda Solis
Walter Isaacson—high priority
Sandy Levin
Loretta Sanchez
Max Baucus
Eliot Engel
Ben Cardin wants me to come give a speech about the 35th anniversary of the Helsinki Accords on the Hill so I thought If
I'm going back to Helsinki for a speech about the Helinski Accords in July maybe I should do the Hill speech around that
time.
Also, Cheryl wants a staff retreat/meeting so what about May 14 or 28?
Did you get info about the Vietnam symposium the State historian, Carland, invited me to open on 9/29?
I want to plan to go to the Arctic Council in Greenland next April.
Did you find out when Cong Reyes's conf on border security was in August?

I have asked Jose to get you a more detailed report but I must tell you the opening of the USA Pavilion has been a great
success so far - at least among the expo-goers. A few vignettes.
- while we don't want to brag to our Chinese hosts, our Pavilion has become the most popular. During the trial runs last
week, the Chinese expo-goers rushed directly from the gates to the USAP (and even broke some of our turn-styles).
Needless to say, the Chinese have improved security. On EACH of the first two days, 30,000 pple visited. Lines are long
and pple are loving the show. We are also getting many foreign officials to visit.
- the 100 US college student ambassadors (who act as guides and speak Mandarin) are the biggest hits of the pavilion.
Fair-goers stand in line to have their photo's taken w them. They explain the show and send a great message.
- the story line that we thght was simplistic is quite popular (the overture where Americans try to say hello in mandarin
is met w howls of laughter and Act II called the Garden is doing well). During the thunderstorm scene a mist comes from
the ceiling and some pple put up their umbrellas. Act I is a bit too commercial but the audience claps and take photo's
when you and President come on the screen.
- we are selling tons of USA merchandise - the two most popular items - mini-basketballs with the USAP seal on it and
the bison stuffed animals - who knew?
Anyway, thght u'd enjoy the quick report. I cannot imagine us not being here! We will keep you posted.
Smart power works!

He has been incorporating fine-tuning edits today. I will email you a draft shortly, which will be tweaked

Subject: E3+Ashton
Steve Mull is proposing that you do a conference call with the E3 FMs and Ashton sometime this week. Here is the
rationale and background:
The European Union Foreign Affairs Council, comprised of all 27 EU Foreign Ministers, will next meet on May 10. In a
conversation April 26, Bill Burns persuaded the E3 and European Commission to support adding to the agenda of that
meeting a discussion of preparations for the sanctions the EU will impose following passage of a UNSCR.
The European Council, comprised of the EU's heads of government, will meet on June 16-17 — a meeting which could
direct the imposition of such sanctions if we succeed in passing an UNSCR by then.
The purpose of your teleconference would be to hear from the E3 and Ashton a status report on the EU's preparations
to impose such sanctions, and to discuss how the U.S. could best support the EU's forward progress. It would
supplement experts' level consultations we have been conducting for several weeks, including meetings on May 3 and
May 6.
The measures the Europeans are considering include bans on new Iranian bank branches in the EU, correspondent
banking relationships, new investment in the Iranian energy sector, and on access for Iranian ships to European ports.

Dear Cheryl:
I have been asked by the Turkish Embassy, who I represent, to request a meeting with Secretary Clinton for Mrs. Umit
Boyner, a prominent Turkish business woman. Such a meeting could be whenever and wherever you determine most
convenient for the Secretary -- either in Washington, DC or Turkey.
As you will see from the biographical information below, Mrs. Boyner has had a distinguished career as a
businesswoman, and she has also devoted time to philanthropy as well. Mrs. Boyner was recently selected to be the
chair person of the board of one of the most prominent Turkish business organizations, the Turkish Industrialists' and
Businessmen's Association (TUSIAD) — an organization comparable to the Business Roundtable. I have also attached a
document providing additional background information on TUSIAD.
Mrs. Umit is a great admirer of Secretary Clinton's and would be extremely honored to be able to meet with her. I know
the Secretary is extremely busy, but I hope she can find a window to meet with Mrs. Umit. Thanks for all you help and
my personal regards to Secretary Clinton.
Best;
Dick

Administration should include education assistance in supplemental funding request for Haiti, Lugar says
Getting Haitian children back in classrooms should be a priority in U.S. assistance to Haiti, U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar said today
after attending the White House Rose Garden ceremony with President Barack Obama hosting Haitian President Rene
Preval. Earlier in the day, former President Bill Clinton also told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that this should
be a priority.
"As the Administration prepares to present its supplemental appropriations request for Haiti, a top priority for recovery
and long term reconstruction efforts in Haiti should include significant assistance to get Haitian children quickly back
into the classroom," Lugar said. "Assistance for infrastructure, technical assistance for instruction and curriculum
development especially should be included. Only with a strong education initiative will Haiti have a chance at a better
future."
Lugar directed two staff members to accompany a Congressional Delegation to Haiti on Friday, March 5. During the visit,
staff saw firsthand the devastation experienced by Haitians and reported to Lugar that thousands of schools in and
around Port au Prince could remain closed for months or never reopen. As a result, Haitian children could be left
languishing in refugee camps. Before the January 12 earthquake approximately one-half of Haiti
<http://topics.nytimes.com/topinews/international/countriesandterritories/haiti/index.html?inline=nyt-geo> 's school-
age children were enrolled in classes. Children make up about 45 percent of Haiti's population.
"The relationship between the United States and the Haitian government should be a consensual, cooperative
arrangement that preserves Haitian participation in decisions, while ensuring that the resources and expertise of the
United States Government and international community are brought to bear on the daily problems of Haiti. Education of
the Haiti's youth is an appropriate starting point," Lugar said.

Re: British election
First and most important: Do NOT, repeat, NOT, call any prospective winner on either Election Night, May 6, or on the
next day, Friday, May 7. The result will be unclear. It will not be clear, even perhaps by Friday afternoon. Today, the
combined polls show Cameron and the Conservatives ahead but not winning an outright majority. The latest Guardian
poll, out tomorrow, shown me by Alan Rusbridger today, has the Tories falling short of a majority of seats. Even if
Cameron were to win an outright majority, Brown and Labour will attempt to make a deal with Clegg and the Liberal
Democrats. Brown remains as Prime Minister unless the Tories win outright, which take a long time to determine.
Labour and the Lib-Dems will almost certainly gain about 60 percent of the vote, more or less. Brown will reach out to
Clegg to stay in power. The deal will be that Brown will approve a referendum on proportional representation giving the
LDs much greater representationin future elections. That will spell the end forever of the Tories ever coming to power.
The Tories see the election in apocalyptic terms—and they are not wrong. Brown's weakness heralds the sort of grand
progressive coalition/alliance that Tony imagined but was never able to attempt between Labour and the LDs. Brown
offering the referendum would be the first step toward that. In the case of the Tories falling short of an outright majority
in seats, they will respond as though Brown is acting illegitimately, which he would not be by remaining as PM and
dealing with Clegg. Informed people are already talking of what might begin to unfold on Friday as "Florida." The Tories,
backed by the Murdoch press, will attempt to push Labour aside by force majeure—something that will not succeed
under those circumstances. The Murdochs are almost literally going crazy. James Murdoch and hiw wife stormed into
the offices of The Independent, not a Murdoch paper, when the paper endorsed the LDs and confronted the publisher,
screaming in the middle of the newsroom. Murdoch would be a big, big loser if Cameron loses. Another possibile

outcome is that the Conservatives come up just short and attempt their own deal with the DUP to cover the gap in seats.
Shaun is on to this potential, has been talking to Peter Robinson.

Clearly I'm not the only one who has made these sacrifices or who has these frustrations; Secretary Clinton has heard

As you know, the EU-IMF-USG consensus hope motivating the Greek bailout is that it will buy time for Spain, Portugal,
etc. From widening credit spreads to falling stock prices, most relevant market indicators are responding with doubt.
Former IMF Chief Economist and NYT Columnist (and influential blogger for bond traders) Simon Johnson has an
important rejoinder to this consensus hope in today's NYT, full text pasted below.
As the EU has no playbook for most of the pressing questions it faces, my staff is working to
brainstorm as to the least bad of what are only sobering options.
This is long but worth it.
May 6, 2010, 6:11 amlt's Not About Greece AnymoreBy PETER BOONE AND SIMON JOHNSONLouisa Gouliamaki/Agence
France-Presse — Getty Images Protesters waved flags from the Acropolis archaeological site behind banners in English
and Greek hung in front of the Parthenon temple in Athens.Peter Boone is chairman of the charity Effective Intervention
and a research associate at the Center for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. He is also a
principal in Salute Capital Management Ltd. Simon Johnson, the former chief economist at the International Monetary
Fund, is the co-author of "13 Bankers."The Greek "rescue" package announced last weekend is dramatic, unprecedented
and far from enough to stabilize the euro zone.The Greek government and the European Union leadership, prodded by
the International Monetary Fund, are 'finally becoming realistic about the dire economic situation in Greece. They have
abandoned previous rounds of optimistic forecasts and have now admitted to a profoundly worse situation. This new
program calls for "fiscal adjustments" — cuts to the fiscal deficit, mostly through spending cuts — totaling 11 percent of
gross domestic product in 2010, 4.3 percent in 2011, and 2 percent in 2012 and 2013. The total debt-to-G.D.P. ratio
peaks at 149 percent in 2012-13 before starting a gentle glide path back down to sanity.This new program is honest
enough to show why it is unlikely to succeed.Daniel Gros, an eminent economist on euro zone issues based in Brussels,
has argued that for each 1 percent of G.D.P. decline in Greek government spending, total demand in the country falls by
2.5 percent of G.D.P. If the government reduces spending by 15 percent of G.D.P. — the initial shock to demand could
be well over 30 percent of G.D.P.Obviously this simple rule does not work with such large numbers, but it illustrates that
Greece is likely to experience a very sharp recession — and there is substantial uncertainty around how bad the
economy will get. The program announced last weekend assumes Greek G.D.P. falls by 4 percent this year, then by
another 2.6 percent in 2011, before recovering to positive growth in 2012 and beyond.Such figures seem extremely
optimistic, particularly in the face of the civil unrest now sweeping Greece and the deep hostility expressed toward

Greece in some northern European policy circles.The pattern of growth is critical because, under this program, Greece
needs to grow out of its debt problem soon. Greece's debt-to-G.D.P. ratio will be a debilitating 145 percent at the end
of 2011.Now consider putting more realistic growth figures into the I.M.F. forecast for Greece's economy — e.g., with
G.D.P. declining 12 percent in 2011, then the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio may reach 155 percent. At these levels, with a 5
percent real interest rate and no growth, the country needs a primary surplus at 8 percent of G.D.P. to keep the debt-to-
G.D.P. ratio stable. It will be nowhere near that level. The I.M.F. program has Greece running a primary budget deficit
of around 1 percent of G.D.P. in that year, and that assumes a path for Greek growth that can be regarded only as an
"upside scenario."The politics of these implied budget surpluses remains brutal. Since most Greek debt is held abroad,
roughly 80 percent of the budget savings the Greek government makes go straight to Germans, French and other foreign
debt holders (mostly banks). If growth turns out poorly, will the Greeks be prepared for ever-tougher austerity to pay
the Germans? Even if everything goes well, Greek citizens seem unlikely to welcome this version of their "new normal."
Last week the European leadership panicked — very late in the day — when it realized that the euro zone itself was at
risk of a meltdown. If the euro zone proves unwilling to protect a member like Greece from default, then bond investors
will run from Portugal and Spain also — if you doubt this, study carefully the interlocking debt picture published
recently in The New York Times. Higher yields on government debt would have caused concerns about potential bank
runs in these nations, and then spread to more nations in Europe.When there is such a "run," it is not clear where it
stops. In the hazy distance, Belgium, France, Austria and many others were potentially at risk.
Even the Germans cannot afford to bail out those nations.Slapped in the face by this ugly scenario, the Europeans
decided to throw everything they and the I.M.F. had at bailing out Greece. The program as announced has only a small
chance of preventing eventual Greek bankruptcy, but it may still slow or avert a dangerous spiral downward — and
enormous collateral damage — in the rest of Europe.The I.M.F. floated in some fashion an alternative scenario with a
debt restructuring, but this was rejected by both the European Union and the Greek authorities. This is not a surprise;
leading European policy makers are completely unprepared for broader problems that would follow a Greek
"restructuring," because markets would immediately mark down the debt (i.e., increase the yields) for Portugal, Spain,
Ireland and even Italy.The fear and panic in the face of this would be unparalleled in modern times: When the Greeks
pay only 50 percent on the face value of their debt, what should investors expect from the Portuguese and Spanish? It
all becomes arbitrary, including which countries are dragged down.Someone has to decide who should be defended and
at what cost, and the European structures are completely unsuited to this kind of tough decision-making under
pressurein the extreme downside scenario, Germany is the only obvious safe haven within the euro zone, so its
government bond yields would collapse while other governments face sharply rising yields. The euro zone would likely
not hold together.There is still a narrow escape path, without immediate debt default and the chaos that that would
produce:•
Talk down the euro — moving toward parity with the American dollar would help lift growth across the euroz one.•
As the euro falls, bond yields will rise on the euro zone periphery. This will create episodes of panic. Enough short-term
financing must be in place to support the rollover of government debt.
Once the euro has fallen a great deal, announce the European Central Bank will support the euro at those levels (i.e.,
prevent appreciation, with G-20 tacit agreement), and also support the peripheral euro zone nations viewed as solvent
by buying their bonds whenever markets are chaotic.
At that stage, but not before, the euro zone leadership needs to push weaker governments to restructure. That will
include Greece and perhaps also Portugal. Hopefully, in this scenario Spain can muddle through.
European banks should be recapitalized as necessary and have most of their management replaced. This is a massive
failure of euro groupthink — including most notably at the political level — but there is no question that bank executives
have not behaved responsibly in a long while and should be replaced en masse.To the extent possible, some of the
ensuing losses should be shared with bank creditors. But be careful what you wish for. The bankers are powerful for a
reason; they have built vital yet fragile structures at the heart of our economies. Dismantle with care.

Sen Mitchell proposes putting out the following statement tomorrow. We would respond on specific commitments on
Ramat Shlomo if asked.
Special Envoy Mitchell left the Middle East on Sunday, where he completed the first round of proximity talks with Israeli
and Palestinian leaders. The talks were serious and wide-ranging.
Special Envoy Mitchell emphasized the importance of making progress in the proximity talks and of moving to direct
negotiations as soon as possible. We have received commitments from both sides, and we have made assurances to
both sides, that are enabling us to move forward. The full scope of these discussions will remain private.
As both parties know, if either side takes significant actions during the proximity talks that we judge would seriously
undermine trust, we will respond to hold them accountable and ensure that negotiations continue.
Special Envoy Mitchell will return to the region next week to continue indirect negotiations with the parties.

After further back and forth, we've come up with a way to mention Ramat Shlomo and incitement to violence that
should be acceptable to both sides. The additional paragraph would read:
We have urged the parties to help create an atmosphere that is conducive to successful talks, and they are responding,
including President Abbas' statement that he will work against incitement of any sort and Prime Minister Netanyahu's

. Re: Sunday, State of Play
Clegg is still in talks with Cameron. About 1,500 Liberal Democrats spontaneously protested at Lib-Dem headquarters
against a deal with the Tories given their policies, especially on Europe. But Clegg remains in negotiations. He seems
quite intent on working it out with Cameron, it appears. His inner Tory magnetically draws him to his heritage. Clegg has
also misplayed almost every turn, presented with big chances and blowing them through a combination of inexperience
(derived partly from heading a party out of power for nearly 100 years) and inbred arrogance (from no less a privileged
background than Cameron, though seeming less snobbish because he went to Westminster instead of Eton and has a
less pronounced upper-class accent, more neutral, because of his more cosmopolitan roots through his family).
What about Labour? Shaun and a couple of others have rounded up about 29 votes from other parties (Scottish National
Party, NI parties, Welsh party) that could be part of a grand progressive once-in-a-lifetime coalition that required the
LDs. Gordon has said he will allow Clegg-Cameron discussions to play out and a general offer to Clegg is on the table, its
terms giving far more on a referendum and policy than the Tories. Behind the scenes, Labour is putting whatever harsh
pressure it can on LD leaders. Peter is playing a cynical double game. He is a sectarian in a sect of one. Yet Gordon for
strange psychological reasons rooted in his triangle with Tony and Peter relies on Peter. Peter, according to Shaun, has
wrung a pledge from Borwn that if Brown emerges from this crisis he, Peter, will replace David as Foreign Secretary.
Meanwhile, Peter has advised David to sideline himself. David has done so instead of being forward as a strong party
man behind Brown in dire straits. Standing back only makes David look ambitious, waiting for Brown to lose and aiming
to a leadership contest afterward, when Peter, as he has promised, would guide David to the prize. The plot thickens: Ed

Miliband, David's younger brother, the environment secretary, will run for leader against his brother if Brown loses. Ed
has more of a common touch. The outcome of that contest would be more than uncertain. But before that eventuality
Gordon's team reaches out to the LDs in private. Yet Shaun's attitude, as I read it, leans toward pessmism. A London
Times polls just out says 62 percent want Gordon out. Where were the fickle voters in the election? The poll shows more
than discontent with Gordon, but also how people are being whipped by the Murdoch media.
What about the Tories? A secret memo from William Hague to Cameron written before the election was leaked this
morning to The Observer (the Sunday paper of The Guardian), proposes an anti-Europe line of the new government.
(I've enclosed the article below.) The atmosphere inside the Conservatives is acrid and anxious. But Lord Ashcroft, the
Tory moneyman, who spent five million pounds alone in marginal districts, is furious that Cameron failed to win outright,
failed in his campaign, made a foolish decision to include Clegg in the debates, etc. Many agree with the evil Ashcroft.
But the finger pointing won't matter if a deal works with Clegg. The Conservative strategy would be to coopt Clegg now,
do whatever deal can be done, maintain a more or less center-right but moderated government for about a year, call a
new election, win outright on the momentum of the recovery engineered by Brown but claimed by Tories as proof that
the change was responsible, jettison Clegg and the LDs, and govern from the radical right as the children of Thatcher for
five years. The Tories would then move on their electoral reforms: cutting the number of seats in Parliament,
redistricting in Conservative favor, and trying to outlaw union contributions to the Labour Party.
What about the LDs? Clegg's deal with the Tories would of course thwart any Lib-Lab coalition, probably the only chance
for a grand progressive alliance that would keep the Tories out of power forever. Clegg's personal instincts obviously
lean toward the Tories, having little to do with policy. The party's leaders may be opposed, but they are also likely to be
feckless and weak as they always have been.
So, whatever the case, I would doubt you'll see David again as Foreign Secretary. Prepare for hauge, who is deeply anti-
European and will be disingenuous with you. Tory budget cuts in NI, already announced, would cause havoc with peace
and economic recovery. I'd send a private message asap on that score the second a new government is announced, if it
is. Tilt publicly to Merkel on Europe for this reason among others.

Tory-Lib Dem coalition threatened by secret hardline memo on Europe • Draft letter by William Hague sets out tough
stance on EU • Leak follows leaders"constructive, amicable' meeting Toby Helm
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tobyhelm> and Anushka Asthana
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/anushkaasthana>
The Observer <http://observerguardian.co.uk> , Sunday 9 May 2010
David Cameron <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davidcameron> 's hopes of forming a coalition with the Liberal
Democrats <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/Iiberaldemocrats> were dramatically undermined last night by the
leaking of a top-secret letter outlining the hardline Eurosceptic stance he and William Hague
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/williamhague> planned to adopt in government.
The document, obtained by the Observer, is headed "draft letter from Foreign Secretary to Prime Minister" and was
written last week. It assumed an outright Tory victory and spelt out how Hague intended to adopt a tough approach to
Europe at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels tomorrow.
In the letter, compiled by civil servants but written in the first person, Hague tells Cameron how his message would be
that "the British relationship with the EU has changed with our election" to one firmly against any further integration.
Exposing the massive gulf between Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/nickclegg>
and the Conservative leadership on Europe, Hague says he would demand the right to repatriate powers over criminal
justice as well as social and employment policy during the first term of a Tory government — demands many EU leaders
say they would resist.
Hague planned to tell his EU counterparts: "Rest assured that we seek engagement, not confrontation. But our aim is to
achieve these commitments during this parliament." He would also tell his first foreign ministers' meeting "we will never
join the euro" and conclude: "You will find us firm but fair, playing a leading role, fighting our corner, practical and
straight-talking."

Last night the Tories said they had no knowledge of the letter. But the Observer understands it was drawn up on the
basis of detailed briefings between senior civil servants and Hague. The document came to light as Clegg, a strong pro-
European, yesterday met his MPs and senior party figures to discuss a possible coalition with the Tories, who emerged
from Thursday's general election with the largest number of seats but short of an overall majority.
Cameron and Clegg held face-to-face talks late yesterday as they continued their attempts to thrash out a power-sharing
deal. A senior Conservative party spokeswoman said the talks were "constructive and amicable". The 70-minute meeting
took place at Admiralty House in Whitehall. A Lib Dem spokesman also described the discussions as "constructive and
amicable".
Tory and Lib Dem sources said last night that discussions would not conclude until the beginning of the coming week at
the earliest. An emergency meeting of the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers will be held tomorrow to discuss the
possible coalition. Today, Hague, Oliver Letwin <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/oliverletwin> and George Osborne
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/georgeosborne> will resume talks with the Lib Dems' Vince Cable, Chris Huhne
and David Laws.
But the stark language used in the letter is bound to alarm Clegg, who has been savage in his criticism of the
Conservatives <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/conservatives>' attitude to Europe which he believes is rooted in
the past and will limit Britain's ability to fight cross-border crime and meet the environmental challenges of the 21st
century.
The document will also be seen by Lib Dem MPs and the party's rank and file as evidence that their pro-Europeanism
would be compromised by linking up with the Tories. A Lib Dem spokesman said the party was strongly pro-European,
but would not be drawn on the document.
Yesterday Cameron came under pressure from senior figures in his own party not to give in to Clegg's demands by
watering down Conservative manifesto commitments. Shadow defence secretary Liam Fox warned that a Tory
government could not be "held to ransom" by Lib Dems demanding proportional representation.
Clegg may also face opposition from within his party to any attempt to form a coalition with the Tories, particularly on
economic issues.
Yesterday the Social Liberal Forum, which represents left-leaning Lib Dems and includes a third of the party's MPs,
issued a set of "red lines" which it said the party must not cross, including any measure that would increase the gap
between the rich and poor— ruling out supporting the Tory pledge to cut inheritance tax. Three other red lines were any
suggestion of cuts to frontline services in the current financial year, any worsening treatment of asylum seekers and any
watering-down of the human rights act.
Meanwhile, Gordon Brown and his closest advisers were working on how to expand their counter-offer to the Lib Dems,
including a referendum on changes to the voting system. Senior officials said Labour was planning to draw up a formal
"coalition contract" — as happens in Germany — that would bind the Lib Dems and other smaller parties into a deal if the
Tory discussions with the Lib Dems were to fail.
Most Labour ministers now believe Brown would have to step down before Clegg would consider a pact, though senior
government insiders insisted this was not being discussed as an option.
One re-elected Labour MP, John Mann, of Bassetlaw, called on Brown to step down as Labour leader, claiming that the
party would have influence on the outcome of the current negotiations only if Brown agreed to give up the leadership.
"Brown should not lead Labour into any future election and he should stand down before the next Labour party
conference," he said. "Gordon Brown's continuation as leader rules out the credibility of a Lib-Lab pact that has to
prioritise the modernisation and reform of the antiquated UK political systems."

Religion and human rights
The limits of freedom and faith
Mar 31st 2010
From The Economist print edition
Opponents of a bid by Muslim states to "protect religion" claim a small success
How dare you call us blasphemers?
IT DOES not happen often: Christian lobbyists, the sort who favour prayer in American classrooms and crucifixes in
Italian ones, lining up on the same side as secularists who battle to curb religion's role in the public square. But in both
those camps there has been some quiet satisfaction after a recent vote at the United Nations. Not over the outcome,
but over the slim margin of defeat.
On March 25th the Human Rights Council (HRC), a Geneva-based UN agency which often exasperates its Western
members, voted by 20 votes to 17, with eight abstentions, for a text that lists the "defamation of religion" as an
infringement of liberty. Nothing amazing there: the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (01C), which groups 56
mainly Muslim states (plus Palestine), has been working to push resolutions of that kind through the General Assembly
and other UN bodies since 2005. But the margin was the smallest ever, and opponents think there could be a good
chance of defeating a "defamation" motion next time one comes around.

The OIC's idea is to establish the principle that faiths need protection, just as individuals do. It denies any sinister
intention (see article <http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15833035> ). And to
some ears, the OIC's effort sounds like harmless UN-speak, but nothing more. (The United States Commission on
International Religious Freedom, a congressionally mandated body, has noted a logical flaw: defamation means harming
the reputation of a living person or entity: that implies that one can't defame an idea or a religious founder who is no
longer, at least physically, alive on earth.)
But critics of the OIC campaign, who include atheists, Christians and indeed some Muslims, say the "defamation" idea is
worse than hot air: far from protecting human rights, it emboldens countries that use blasphemy laws to criminalise
dissent. What encourages these critics is that more countries seem to be coming around to their view. Mexico, Uruguay,
Argentina, Zambia and South Korea voted against the latest resolution. Brazil criticised the text but abstained.
Deeper still inside the UN's bureaucracy, another battle over religion rages—and the stakes could be even higher. An "ad
hoc committee" is mulling ways to amend or extend the UN convention on racial discrimination. Certain states want
language that would fuse the categories of race and faith; some want a new convention, or a protocol to the existing
one.
For secularists (in the broad sense of people, including believers, who oppose the idea of faith having privileged access
to power), all this is alarming. Non-binding resolutions against defamation are bad enough; a UN treaty on race-plus-
religion would have legal force, at least for its signatories, and give heart to theocrats.
At the HRC's latest discussion of this effort in March, the Algerian who oversees the project was keen to plough ahead.
But countries like Switzerland, Japan, Mexico, Argentina and France retorted that it would be better to enforce the
existing UN norms than dream up new ones. Efforts to widen the racism accord will resume, with a new chairman, late
this year—but critics are relieved to have stalled it. Still, would-be theocrats may now focus harder on adding to the
racism charter, because they face a real risk of being defeated over defamation, in the view of Roy Brown, Geneva
spokesman for the International Humanist and Ethical Union.
Meanwhile a Christian-inspired NGO, the European Centre for Law and Justice, has been denouncing the abuse of
blasphemy laws in many OIC member states. How fair is their point? It is an easy case to make, for example, over
Pakistan.
Some 41 complaints of blasphemy were registered by police in Pakistan last year, says that country's independent
Human Rights Commission. In theory, blasphemy is punishable by death—a penalty that has been handed down but
never carried out. Worst-hit by the law are minorities like Christians and Ahmadis, a group whose claim to be Muslim is
rejected by the Pakistani state. Although abuse of the law is less rife now than in the 1980s, when an Islamist general
tightened up the rules, the law is still invoked in disputes (over property, say) that have nothing to do with faith.
"The most vulnerable people, that is religious minorities, continue to be charged with blasphemy," said All Dayan Hasan,
a researcher at Human Rights Watch, a campaign group. "But are people convicted? No. Rarely. It is used as an
instrument of political and social coercion."
When convictions occur, they lead to long jail terms; and pre-trial detention can last for years. Pakistan's parliament is
revising the constitution but it has left intact the religious bits, despite a vow by the ruling party to review the
blasphemy laws. (Indonesia too has stepped back from a move to liberalise its blasphemy regime.)
On Pakistani streets, the law has dire effects. In January 2009, in a village in Punjab province, five Ahmadis, a labourer
and four children, were charged with blasphemy. They had supposedly written "Prophet Muhammad" on the wall of a
mosque toilet. The children were behind bars for nearly six months till the charge was quashed.
And last September a young Pakistani Christian was accused of throwing part of the Koran down a drain. It seems that
his real crime, however, was affection for a Muslim woman. A mob torched a church, and many Christians had to flee.

He was taken to jail, where he died a few days later. His family alleged torture; the authorities claimed suicide. There
was mayhem at the funeral and the country's Christians (see picture) were appalled. In some places, it is not the
"defamation" of faith that threatens rights but measures that supposedly defend it.

I just wanted to make sure you know that the CARE speech is now going to focus on nutrition/health/early childhood,
rather than being a major health speech. I still feel that you need to do a health speech as a bookend to food and water
— perhaps before UNGA. You could focus on health in the context of the larger Millennium Dev Goals. You have not
given a speech yet about maternal and child health. We have a great story to tell with our investment in GHI, and there
will be an opportunity to tell it with the ramp-up to UNGA (with the Summit focusing on MDGs). There is a tremendous
amount of activity going on elsewhere in the world. And this is a legacy issue for you. (I have already relayed this idea to
CDM and Jake).

Hi Lona, I just saw the S video for Mother's Day: After nearly 10 years of working for the Department, this ranks as one
of my proudest, most fulfilling moments of serving as a Foreign Service Officer.
Clearly I'm not the only one who has made these sacrifices or who has these frustrations; Secretary Clinton has heard
our struggles (indeed has gone through her own struggles as a professional mom!), and she truly gets it.
I just wanted to tell somebody, and I remembered your name from the women's conference in December. Forgive this
long message. Happy Mother's Day, and congratulations on working with such an incredible person.

To more fully answer your question, the CARE speech is important because it focuses on a chronically overlooked issue
(nutrition) that sits at the intersection of two of your signature issues. It gives us an opportunity to sharpen our
development message. It also tees up the health care speech you might give before UNGA. This is a speech that only
you could give and a number of constituencies will be delighted by it.
Hope this helps. I'm going through it now to make sure, it more clearly answers your question.
Thank you!

From Foster Care To Law School Graduate, Howard University Student Beats The Odds
Jelani Freeman lived in 6 foster homes in 10 years
Updated: Friday, 07 May 2010, 8:25 PM EDT Published : Friday, 07 May 2010, 7:55 PM EDT
By BETH PARKER/myfoxdc
WASHINGTON - Jelani Freeman has gone through a lot to wear this robe. This weekend, he will graduate from Howard
University Law School.
He remembers the shaky foundation of his young life. A mother who could not take care of him. He lived in six foster
homes in ten years.
"Moving to these different homes. The kids were like 'you weren't here yesterday.' Where's your mom at?" said
Freeman.
At 18 years old, he left the system and went to college in search of room and board. He knew what people expected of
kids in the foster care system - not much.
"All I would hear is that they were in jail or homeless or weren't doing too well," said Freeman.
He beat the odds and graduated, but he felt ... alone.
"I can distinctly remember walking across the stage in undergrad. You know at graduation everyone has their cheer
section that yells as you walk across the stage and there was almost silence as I walked across," said Freeman.
It will be different this time. When Freeman gets his diploma Saturday at the convention center, there will be 26 people
- friends and supporters from as far away as California - in D.C. to show their support.
Freeman also got a boost from an internship program for kids who have spent time in foster care. He was placed in the
office of then Senator Hillary Clinton. Clinton even mentions him in the updated version of her book "It Takes A Village."
Now, he may use his law degree to work on public policy - especially children's issues. He wants all kids to know:
"There's a bright future out there for you if you stay focused and work hard."

And to the adults who hear his story, Freeman said help a child. He is living proof of the difference it can make.

mom's words, "instead of feeling sorry for herself she takes the ball and runs with all the energy that she can summon in
the service of her country to the limit of her body ....and she dishes it out frankly without pussy footing around whether
to heads of State or media or major international conferences." I felt VERY proud to be on your team. AM

BY VALERIE M. HUDSON, PATRICIA LEIDL I MAY 10, 2010
One day in November 2009, in Helmand province's capital of Lashkar Gah, a group of Afghan widows and divorcees met
with Patricia, who had been commissioned to write a series of success stories for the U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID). All the women were in their 20s, 30s, and 40s but looked to be in their 60s. Until very recently,
none of them could work because they possessed no marketable skills, could neither read nor write, and were at risk of
being killed if they left their homes. A number of women said that, before the program -- which focused on tailoring and
basic literacy -- their children used to weep at night from hunger.

As Patricia prepared to leave, the women fluttered around her like moths, touching her sleeves and speaking all at once.
"What are they saying?" Pat asked the young Pashto-speaking interpreter. "They are telling you to go back to your
country and to ask your people not to abandon them. The women of Afghanistan don't want you to leave. They will
quite literally die if the Taliban return," she said.
In a recent question-and-answer period at one of our universities, Brigham Young, a student asked Gen. David Petraeus
whether anyone thought to ask the women of Afghanistan how they felt about U.S. hopes to incorporate "reformed"
Taliban into governance structures as the Americans leave.
Carefully avoiding the word "women," the general assured the questioning student that only "moderate" Taliban would
be eligible for such rehabilitation. Left unaddressed was the definition of "moderate," which clearly depends on where
you sit: If you sit in a burqa, there is no such thing as a "moderate" Taliban.
Petraeus might find it easy now to sidestep the question of what will happen to Afghanistan's women once the
"moderate" Taliban come back, but it's likely to haunt him for a long time. Without the security of women there is no
security -- and until we've done more to protect it, we have a moral and practical obligation to stay in Afghanistan.
In 2001, George W. Bush's administration interpreted the first post-invasion photos of Afghan girls heading to school
and of Afghan women unveiling their faces as tangible evidence that conditions were improving in that benighted land.
A few months after the invasion, in his 2002 State of the Union address, Bush announced
<http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/01/29/bush.speech.txt/> , "The last time we met in this chamber, the
mothers and daughters of Afghanistan were captives in their own homes, forbidden from working or going to school.
Today women are free and are part of Afghanistan's new government."
The Americans strong-armed a handful of women into the loya jirga that then drafted the Afghan Constitution. They
strong-armed a quota for women in the Afghan national legislature -- something that even American women are not
treated to. U.S. troops built schools for girls and pushed for women to be included in the local shuras, and USAID ripped
a page from Greg Mortenson's Three Cups of Tea
<http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143038257?ie=UTF8&tag=fopo-
20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0143038257> and facilitated new training and
educational opportunities for women.
But the current administration, despite its female secretary of State and its new Office of Global Women's Issues,
appears to be ditching the women of Afghanistan like a blind date gone bad. You have to go back 10 months to find any
sustained rhetoric from President Barack Obama about the importance of assuring the security of women in

Afghanistan. Since then, and especially since last year's Afghan election, those fine words from a sitting president have
all but disappeared. Many of the fine actions are gone, too. Push local shuras into including women in 2002? Yes. Push
local shuras into including women in 2010? Forget it.
It's not difficult to understand why. Afghanistan is in crisis. The cynical policies that characterized the early to mid-stages
of the occupation have come home to roost. President Hamid Karzai and his rogue's gallery of kleptocrats, human rights
abusers, and drug lords are hanging onto power even as Karzai declares open season on the United Nations by accusing
senior bureaucrats of organizing the widespread voter fraud that consolidated his own hold on power.
In the meantime, women have taken a back seat to realpolitik and the exigencies of a coalition exit strategy. But their
suffering is real, as Afghanistan's poverty and chaos affect women possibly most of all. Maternal mortality in Afghanistan
still makes the world's top three list, nine years after the U.S. invasion, resulting in a life expectancy for women of 46. In
the countryside, Taliban zealots spray acid into girls' faces for going to school -- and only 27 percent of them do so in the
first place. According to a recent survey by the U.N. Development Fund for Women, 87 percent of Afghan women report
being beaten on a regular basis.
In July of last year, the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) issued a report
<http://unama.unmissions.org/Portals/UNAMA/vaw-english.pdf> that represents the most stinging official
condemnation of the Karzai administration's abysmal track record on women to date. The report concluded, "The
current reality is that ... women are denied their most fundamental human rights and risk further violence in the course
of seeking justice for crimes perpetrated against them." Last year Karzai pardoned well-connected political thugs who --
before witnesses -- gang-raped a woman with a bayonet. Her husband, who had battled for redress, was assassinated
soon thereafter. Women who dare to speak out against the widespread trampling of their rights face almost certain
death <http://www.hrw.oreen/reports/2009/12/03/we-have-promises-world-O> while their murderers face 100
percent impunity.
For the warlords and mujahideen that make up the upper echelons of the Karzai government, the issue of gender
equality was always an unwanted appendage to U.S. involvement -- but one that could easily be dispensed with through
the deployment of flowery speeches and the token appointment of a lone female minister to the Ministry of Women's
Affairs. Indeed, just before his recent "election," Karzai felt secure enough to sign into law a series of repressive
measures designed to repeal what minimal gains women have made since the Taliban ouster.
Although eventually forced to back down over legislation that allows Shiite husbands to rape their wives, Karzai
successfully signed into law other legislation that denies or severely limits women's rights to inherit, divorce, or have
guardianship of their own children. The Shiite Personal Status Law
<http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/04/14/afghanistan-new-law-threatens-women-s-freedom> also legalizes forced
marriage and the rape of minors. It allows men to exert almost total control over female relatives and offers them the
power to prohibit women's access to work, education, and health care by denying them the right to leave their homes
except for "legitimate" purposes. Even Karzai's own wife -- a doctor whose skills are desperately needed -- is strictly
sequestered. And if this sounds bad, just wait until the Americans leave.
This is not just about women. Gender inequality not only affects girls and women, but boys and men. In Afghanistan,
because women are rarely able to leave the house, very young boys are often forced to carry an unwarranted amount of
financial responsibility, something that limits their prospects as well.
Nor is it even just about Afghanistan. As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said
<http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/03/138320.htm> in March, "The subjugation of women is a threat to the
national security of the United States." On a geopolitical level, Valerie's research has found that states with higher levels
of violence against women are also less peaceful internationally. Indeed, violence against women is a better predictor of
bellicosity than level of democracy, level of wealth, or presence of Islamic civilization. In a 2010 study, Valerie, along
with Brad Thayer, also found high levels of gender inequality to be a strong aggravating factor in the development of
Islamic suicide terrorism.

So, given the desperate need of Afghanistan's women and the serious consequences worldwide, why aren't we doing
more to help? One reason is the fallacious notion, common among coalition members, that Afghan "culture" does not
allow for gender equality and that forcing the issue will undermine Western interests. Pat heard this openly from one
coalition representative, who prefers to remain anonymous: "There is no point in pushing gender equality. It will only
alienate them [Afghans]." Of course, "them" here refers only to men.
But decision-makers forget that culture is not fixed, but is highly mutable and dynamic. More than 30 years ago, Afghan
women were attending universities, teaching, working as doctors, nurses, and professors. Far from being a black hole of
gender apartheid, Afghanistan, though impoverished, was more progressive than many of its Muslim neighbors.
Furthermore, many young Afghans are open to new ways of doing things. In 2009, hundreds of Afghan men and women
bravely stood together in Kabul to protest Karzai's support for a new and oppressive Shiite family law. If Americans
assume that all Afghan men are Neanderthals incapable of sympathizing with the plight of their sisters, they are wrong.
Another, more unmentionable reason may be the chauvinism that permeates Western military culture. U.S. military life,
despite increasing female recruitment and even "female engagement teams," remains a bastion of masculinity, with
little sensitivity toward questions of female rights. For military leadership and recruits alike, immured as they are in an
almost exclusively male world, the complete absence of women from Afghanistan's streets and villages elicited no
comment from the Marines who surrounded Pat, though she as a woman noticed it immediately.
And the ready availability of pornography on U.S. bases, coupled with seamier depictions of life in the West, not only
damages prospects for gender equality but by extension, Western interests. As one young, well-educated 24-year-old
Afghan male pointed out, "Your culture has no respect for women at all. Look at your pornography and the way you
exploit women in ways that we can't even imagine. Do you call that progress?" Added another Afghan USAID
programmer working in Gardez, a man in his 50s who is the father of three girls, "It would be better for the coalition if
they could figure out a way to limit this kind of material."
We can do better -- much better.
The Obama administration must instill in all military personnel and senior diplomats the necessity of fully protecting
women's rights. Key to that is educating them about how gender equality furthers Western interests and security.
The military should spend less time courting "moderate" Taliban and more time showing Afghan community leaders
how gender equality -- including female access to family planning methods -- will result in healthier families, lower
maternal and child death rates, poverty alleviation, and greater self-determination. Gender should be included as a
component in all governance training and should be placed front and center in the upcoming "peace jirga" that will
include the Taliban. Indeed, let half of the negotiating team representing the government and the coalition be female:
yes, a full 50 percent.
Women must also be represented in the government. As Melanne Verveer, U.S. ambassador at large for global women's
issues, noted <http://www.state.gov/s/gwi/rls/rem/2009/125512.htm> last summer, speaking of female politicians in
Afghanistan, "There is only one minister in the cabinet, and she is powerless. There is a low percentage of women in the
civil service. There is only one female governor, in Bamiyan." Obama must insist on important changes for women
before we leave and make subsequent aid contingent upon maintenance of a strong presence for women in the Afghan
government.
Better yet, the coalition needs to support "regime change" through the building of democratic institutions that will
groom a moderate, educated middle class of young women and men to eventually take over. Over two-thirds of the
Afghan population is under the age of 25, which is either a real opportunity for social change -- if they are educated and
given a chance to shape their society in a progressive way -- or a major obstacle, if they find themselves without jobs,
unable to marry, and burdened with retrograde attitudes of what it means to be male and female.
We must hold Afghanistan responsible for its treaty obligations under the U.N. Convention on the Elimination of
Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and U.N. Security Council Resolution 1325 on women, peace, and security.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774862 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774862 Date: 08/31/2015
Afghanistan signed CEDAW without reservations (the United States interestingly, has not), and that means that it has
committed to passing whatever legislation is necessary to implement the wide-ranging principles of gender equality
enshrined in that treaty. This includes taking measures to ensure that women enjoy the same basic human rights and
fundamental freedoms as men, having in place legal and judicial procedures to protect the rights of women, taking
measures to eliminate sexist discrimination, and lastly, submitting national reports every four years to a U.N. advisory
group of international experts, the CEDAW Committee, to ensure transparency on what measures the country has taken
to implement the treaty's provisions.
Unanimously adopted in 2000, UNSC 1325 marked the first time the Security Council recognized the disproportionate
and unique impact of armed conflict on women and stressed the importance of their equal and full participation as
active agents in peace and security.
Needless to say, women do not currently enjoy the same fundamental freedoms as men, and indeed, with the passing of
the Shiite family law, many are worse off than they were before.
To change this, the coalition needs to stay in Afghanistan. Withdrawing at this critical juncture would doom Afghanistan
and the entire region to instability and effectively consign one half of the population to premature death and an
existence not fit for animals.
We are creating a shameful American tradition of leaving women no better off (Afghanistan) -- or even much worse off
(Iraq) -- than before U.S. troops intervened. On the basis of America's track record, women around the world should
have no faith that U.S. soldiers will improve their security. Despite Clinton's remarks on the link between gender equality
and security, on the ground Americans act as if women's well-being, in the end, is not more than peripherally related to
the issue of peace. As we have seen, this view could not be more wrong. Verveer's benchmarks
<http://www.state.gov/s/gwi/rls/rem/2009/125512.htm> concerning Afghanistan are the right ones: "Progress in
Afghanistan must be measured not just in military terms, but also in terms of social, political, and economic participation
of women in rebuilding Afghanistan and in the safeguarding of their human rights."
American women are right to ask why we are sending their sons and daughters to fight and die so that Afghan women
can continue to be treated like an inferior subspecies of humanity. When you break faith with Afghan women, you break
faith with American women. You also break faith with your reasons for being there in the first place.

Subject: Hi Sis. My name is Roy Spence and I love you and
...I miss you a lot. And I have no idea how you keep on keeping on doing whatever it takes to lift people-everywhere up-
championing your Core Purpose of Fighting and digging deep for the opportunity for each person to be able to live up to
their God Given Potential. Here and Around the world.
The struggle for an Iran that is more concerned about its people than false power. The relentless quest to stabilize the
un-stable. The never give up journey to inspire and empower women and young girls to have a seat at the table of full
opportunity. The pursuit for opening doors of happiness for those who struggle with the unimaginable. The steady. The
Steadfast. The unwavering commitment to the dream-not the hope-but the dream of a better USA and world for all. The
tough and uncompromising "pretend leaders" whom you have negotiate with. The opinion rich and caring poor
arrogance of the mean spirited. The stuff that is on the news but is not really the real news.
The love and respect you give freely to all whom love life and liberty and opportunity for all.
The raw respect that you have earned in the trenches of real fears, real love and real longing for a village that is
Dedicated to raising a village and its children.
So I say to a beloved and dear love one-that be you-I love you. I respect you. I miss you. I cherish every moment of our
remarkable journey together.
God Speed. Dear Sis. We shall cross paths soon. And until then. Onward in all things.
Love
RS

Colleagues, the latest from Amb. Feinstein of Embassy Warsaw. In short, the crash took the lives of many of Poland's
senior civilian and military leadership; succession/transition will be the first major test of Poland's constitution. The
speaker of the lower house of parliament, Bronislaw Komorowski, will temporarily assume the presidency. The
constitution requires he call for presidential elections within 14 days and that elections take place within 60 days. An
unofficial manifest is included. Rgds, H.

All,
This is going out as a cable momentarily. The main point is that the.crash killed not only the President and his wife but a
broad swath of Poland's top national security leadership. In this sense it is an unprecedented governmental tragedy,
and a test of Poland's constitution. The sitrep follows.

Shortly before 1000 Warsaw time, a Polish government Tu-154 plane carrying a delegation headed by Polish President
Lech Kaczynski crashed in heavy fog at the airport in Smolensk, Russia. Russian officials have told the press that there
were no survivors; the foreign ministry spokesman said there were 88 passengers on board. The delegation was en
route to ceremonies hosted by the Russian government to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacres.
There is as yet not government confirmation of the deaths, but there is no expectation of survivors.
Speaker of the Polish Sejm (the lower house of parliament) Bronislaw Komorowski is en route to Warsaw to take over
the powers of the presidency and those of the Commander in Chief, according to press reports. According to the Polish
constitution, if the president dies in office, the Speaker temporarily assumes the presidency, and has 14 days to
announce the date of special presidential elections. The elections must be held within 60 days of his announcement.
This is the first major test of the Polish constitution, and the government is itself sorting out the details of the procedure
in this unprecedented circumstance.
Prime Minister Tusk is returning from Gdansk to Warsaw, and will chair a meeting of the Council of Ministers at 1P local
time. Tusk has received condolence telephone calls from Russian Prime Minister Putin, German Chancellor Angela
Merkel, and other world leaders.
The magnitude of the loss is difficult to overstate including, in addition to the President and the First Lady, the top
national security leadership of the Presidential Chancellery, the head of Poland's armed forces, all or nearly all of
Poland's military chiefs, a deputy minister of defense, a deputy foreign minister, a presidential candidate, and members
of Parliament. Crowds of people with candles and flowers have started to assemble in front of the presidential palace in
downtown Warsaw. A mass in honor of those who died will be held later this afternoon. Poland is in shock and entering
a period of deep national mourning.
Below is an unofficial and incomplete manifest of those who are on the plane. Among them are:
President Lech Kaczynski
First Lady Maria Kaczynska
Former President Ryszard Kaczorowski
Wladislaw Stasiak, Chief of the Chancellery of the President of the Republic of Poland
Aleksander Szczyglo, State Secretary, Chancellery of the President of the Republic of Poland and Chief of the Office of
National Security

SECURITY COUNCIL PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT ON THE RECENT INCIDENT IN THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN
The Security Council deeply regrets the loss of life and injuries resulting from the use of force during the Israeli military
operation in international waters against the convoy sailing to Gaza. The Council, in this context, condemns those acts
which resulted in the loss of at least ten civilians and many wounded, and expresses its condolences to their
families. The Security Council requests the immediate release of the ships as well as the civilians held by Israel. The
Council urges Israel to permit full consular access, to allow the countries concerned to retrieve their deceased and
wounded immediately, and to ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance from the convoy to its destination. The
Security Council takes note of the statement of the UN Secretary—General on the need to have a full investigation into
the matter and it calls for a prompt, impartial, credible and transparent investigation conforminglo international
standards. The Security Council stresses that the situation in Gaza is not sustainable. The Council re-emphasizes the
importance of the full implementation of Resolutions 1850 and 1860. In that context, it reiterates its grave concern at
the humanitarian situation in Gaza and stresses the need for sustained and regular flow of goods and people to Gaza as
well as unimpeded provision and distribution of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza. The Security Council
underscores that the only viable solution to Israeli-Palestinian conflict is an agreement negotiated between the parties
and re-emphasizes that only a two-State solution, with an independent and viable Palestinian State living side by side in
peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours, could bring peace to the region. The Security Council expresses
support for the proximity talks and voices concern that this incident took place while the proximity talks are underway
and urges the parties to act with restraint, avoiding any unilateral and provocative actions, and all international partners
to promote an atmosphere of cooperation between the parties and throughout the region.

Statement by the Secretary
The Death of Polish President Kaczynski and His Delegation
I join President Obama in offering my deepest condolences to the people of Poland, to the Kaczynski family, and to the
families of all those killed in this tragedy. Lost alongside President Kaczynski and his wife were Polish leaders from
across the political spectrum, men and women who shaped and sped Poland's post-1989 democratic transformation and
were leading Poland into its promising future. The tragedy of these lives cut short will be felt deeply across the world,
but their legacy will live on in a free and flourishing Poland.
The United States stands with the Polish people in this difficult hour. Like the country he led, President Kaczynski was
one of America's most valued and trusted allies. He was well known in the United States as a champion for democracy
against an oppressive regime, a man whose journey took him from the Gdarisk Shipyards to the presidency of a free
people. President Kaczynski was an unstinting advocate for freedom and human rights not just in Poland, but around
the world. He will be long remembered and sorely missed.
The Polish people have endured more than their share of sorrow, but they have always shown resilience and resolve in
the face of adversity -- and I know they will pull together in solidarity to grieve this loss.
My thoughts and prayers are with all the people of Poland today.

Re: Hague meeting
On your meeting on Friday, May 14, with new British Foreign Secretary William Hague you might explore a number of
issues below. (I've discussed with Shaun.)
1. Northern Ireland. Cameron has pledged to reduce public sector spending in NI. But the impact of public sector
spending there is not the same as in other parts of the UK because of 40 years of troubles. Political stability depends
upon economic stability. Removing funding specifically threatens community policing, creating a vacuum that the Real
IRA and other men of violence would rush into. Cutting the public sector would make it difficult to increase private
sector investment. Does the new government understand the US interest in NI and appreciate the fragility of the
situation?
2. Defense and Foreign Policy Cuts. The new government program is to slash the deficit, cutting deeply into
government programs. This really cannot be done without defense and foreign policy reductions. Seek claficiation on
exactly whether and where these cuts be made. Will they affect Afghanistan policy and over what schedule? How will
cuts in the foreign service affect British influence in other areas?
3. Trident and Nuclear Deterrent. The coalition agreement between the Conservative and Liberal Democrats allows
the LDs to abstain in parliamentary votes on four issues that will apparently let the Tories have their way: marriage tax
allowances; nuclear power; college tuition fees; and Trident and the nuclear deterrent. During the campaign, the LDs ran
on eliminating the Trident and erasing the UK nuclear deterrent. How will this actually work in practice?

4. Political Changes. The new government, because the coalition is fundamentally at odds with itself, has proposed to
pass a parliamentary bill that establishes a five year term for a government and furthermore establishes that a vote of
no confidence can only be passed on a 55 percent vote. You might just seek Hague's view on how this will work.

I hope in the next few days we can focus on some of the themes in the following:
1. On 9 April, I had lunch in Kabul with expert on Afghanistan now based at
was on his way back to Washington via a meeting in Paris with the
French Political Director. He had just spend three weeks in Kandahar and Gardez, his first visit since August last year. He
came across as patriotic, but deeply worried, speaking in a monologue, mostly in French. •

OVERALL SITUATION
2. aid that his assessment was that the overall situation had deteriorated sharply since his last visit. The Taliban B6
were stronger, and more confident, than ever. ISAF was inflicting heavy losses on them, but the scale was as nothing
compared with what the mujahideen had endured at the hands of the Russians. Moreover, the change in rules of
engagement — to prevent civilian casualties, and fewer night raids — had been interpreted by the Taliban as signalling
weakness on NATO's part. In i e w , most of the East, and Kunduz, was effectively lost to the Taliban and their
fellow travellers. US forces in the East controlled the ground they occupied or passed over, but little more: they were in
a similar position to the Soviet Army. Moreover, the population did not want to back them, and was resisting US
attempts to set up tribal militias or implant US Special Forces in the villages. did, however, acknowledge that he
had heard that the US Marines in Helmand were behaving much more sensitively towards the population than had been
expected. But the situation in Marjah was not good. Of course, the Marines held the ground, but violence would
continue for months or years. This did not offer the positive signal of momentum for which the Coalition had been
hoping.
KANDAHAR
3. said repeatedly that he did not understand the strategy in Kandahar. The Taliban had effectively penetrated,
an argely controlled, a city of one million people. The ANP there were largely Barakzai, and working for either or both
of the Taliban or Ahmed Wali Karzai's network. AWK was at the centre of a vast criminal enterprise: his brother-in-law
was one of the largest drug traffickers in the south. When I said that surely ISAF could gradually occupy the city,
squeezing the Taliban back and out,F7said he was not certain of that: he thought that there might well be quite
violent resistance from the Taliban. He was also dismissive of the ISAF strategy of "managing" AWK: if the latter really
did abandon his criminal ways, he would be dead. He would lose the protection of his militias. In such situations, one
could only move forward, or go into prison or exile: there was no going back. AWK had just too many enemies to survive
in Kandahar without the protection of his own criminal networks.77guess was that AWK would promise to be
good, but in reality stick to his old habits, and hope to profit from the action taken by ISAF against the Taliban.
was dismissive of efforts to empower Governor Weesa, who would not survive five minutes in Kandahar without
Western support and protection. Although Weesa came from the area, he had no power base, and, with his Canadian
nationality, was regarded by the Kandaharis as a foreigner.
4. as also sceptical as to whether ISAF could "shura" its way to success in Kandahar. On the military side, he
thought ISAF just couldn't generate the force densities necessary to control the city: for example, he thought the
Argandab would require getting on for 15,000 troops to control it properly. The city of Kandahar would require some
10,000 fresh police, who were just not available.
NEXT STEPS
5. said he was worried about where the coalition was heading. The best that could be expected was a messy
stalemate in Kandahar, but the probability was, by the early autumn, an outcome that would not look at all like success.

r—,
■vondered whether ISAF really did need to go ahead with its plan to take Kandahar: in iew, he was riding
for a fall. I said that I did not see how we could pull back now. The planners were well aware of the risks, but wanted to
generate positive momentum to enable a political process to take hold.
MAKING PEACE
6.F7said that, in his view, the only way out now was a negotiated peace with the Taliban and all the other parties to
the conflict. He thought that Pakistan would need to help Karzai and the Americans open such a dialogue with the
Taliban, but, sooner or later, both Pakistan and Karzai would need to be moved to one side, and there would need to be
direct talks between the Americans and the Taliban. The Taliban would not make a final peace with Karzai, who had
little credibility left. Similarly, the senior Taliban leaders would need to be brought across the border into Afghanistan,
to get them out from under the control of the ISI. All this would need deception and trickery: for the first time in his
careerould see that diplomats were needed, in this case to finesse a delicate process, involving multiple
negotiations. Karzai would have to eased out, but gently and with plenty of public respect.
7. said that there would need to be a cease-fire, and wondered why ISAF couldn't occupy the high ground by
being the first to offer such a move. There would also have to be frank discussions about the withdrawal of foreign
forces.
8. said that his main worry was that the Obama Administration would waste another year ploughing on with a
military campaign which could deliver stalemate at best, and a serious reverse at worst. Then, with the 2011-12
Presidential election campaign getting going, the White House would panic, handing the problem to Pakistan, and pull
US troops out more quickly than the situation merited. It was vital to get ahead of the curve, and start making
preparations now for a messy political process that could last months or years.
9. said that he had known from 2001 that the Western intervention in Afghanistan had been fraught with danger.
He had suspected then, and knew even more strongly now, that the Taliban could not be defeated or even properly
contained by military means. Once again, he was sick with worry at the way things were going. He had thought that the
Obama Administration had understood that the solutions in Afghanistan were political, not military. He was trying to
think how he and other concerned experts could shock the Administration in getting a political grip on the situation: he
was considering a joint op-ed by a group of experts. The seriousness of the situation meant that such an article would
have to concentrate on essentials: much of the talk about counter-insurgency (in what was an Afghan civil war) and
development and governance was no more than "poetry".
10. I pointed out to the political difficulties for the US and other Western governments in negotiating direct with
the Taliban. Although the principle of a negotiated peace was accepted, more or less, in Washington and London, there
was a long way to go before politicians fully addressed what that might involve. Hence the argument that we needed -
first to get on the front foot militarily. It would help if the Taliban could be pinned down on politically neuralgic issues,
such as women's rights and social restrictions. said that, in a serious negotiation, he thought such undertakings
could be extracted from the Taliban: again, however, the sooner work started on that, the more chance of a satisfactory
result.

11. I told that much of this thinking coincided with the views expressed by the Foreign Secretary in his article in
The New York Review of Books of 29 April 2010 Phad missed the MIT speech, as he had been in Kandahar). The UK B6
election campaign meant that there was little that could be done over the next few weeks, apart from making sure that
incoming or returning Ministers had the best possible advice. After the election, there was clearly a case for a good
strategic discussion between the British Prime Minister and the American President: we all needed to raise our eyes
from the urgent tactical preoccupations in the south to the really important strategic issues, of harvesting political
success from military progress.

HRC,
Researched a lot since Tuesday. After Rochester water security meeting Simon came to my house last evening to discuss
subject issue, etc. Heck, greater good sometimes served in such small patio fashion. Re human trafficking, his software
can apply and previously uninvolved resources / relationships available. You know all this, but we didn't: Seems 'acta
non verba' needed. Despite increased pre-victimization education & awareness growing - and not-for-profits, TVP Act of
2008, your G/TIP office helping, appears same apps as tracking terror cells, interdiction of pirating and drug trafficking,
removal of financial lure not fully brought to bear. Forgive oversimplification, but akin to cessation of 400 years of
African / transatlantic slave trade..In addition to crushing backers' / sponsors' greed ( I guess so-called 'law' of economics
) blocking trader access, interdicting in progress, punishing / eliminating traders (sponsors & backers) would appear
to get it done. In addition to 21st century tech & resources, moral outrage should help eliminate / vastly reduce this
scourge. No doubt many good & smart people already involved, but perhaps the more the merrier. Simon ( and Dave's
former partner Jim Blom ) can bring nourishment to this table. Simon will get / remain in touch with Phil Goldberg - and
both of us with Kris. Thinking same apps could apply to Mexico. Talk about a destabilizing scourge too close for comfort !
We want to help. Great to see you & thanks again.

Tory lead narrows amid huge voter disenchantment, Times poll finds
Conservative party leader David Cameron launches his party's manifesto in Battersea Power Station, in London, England

Peter Riddell
The general election race is tightening, according to a Populus poll for The Times that reveals deep public
disenchantment with the campaign so far.
The poll, undertaken yesterday and this morning, says that more voters are now hoping for a hung parliament than
either a Tory or a Labour outright victory.
Conservative support has slipped by three points over the past week to 36 per cent, while Labour is a point up at 33 per
cent. The Liberal Democrats are unchanged on 21 per cent.
The polls tend to fluctuate by a couple of points either way, and these shifts are within the margin of error of the
average.
With other new polls pointing to a firming in Labour support, the party may have enjoyed a small boost from its
manifesto launch. Tory strategists will hope to have achieved a boost from its manifesto launch today.
If the Populus figures were repeated in the general election in three weeks' time, and there is a uniform switch in votes,
Labour would be the largest single party, with about 300 MPs, ahead of the Tories on 264 and the Lib Dems on 54. This
would point to a Lab/Lib Dem coalition. But many analysts do not expect a uniform national swing.
The latest poll shows that 32 per cent of the public now hope for a hung parliament (as opposed to expecting one),
against 28 per cent wanting a Tory majority and 22 per cent a Labour one..Lib Dem voters prefer a deal with Labour than
the Tories in a hung parliament, by 44 to 31 per cent. The public is evenly split 40 to 42 per cent about whether they
want Labour or the Tories in either a majority or a minority government.
The poll shows that the number expecting a Tory overall majority has risen by three points to 34 per cent over the past
week. This only just exceeds the number expecting a hung parliament, at 33 per cent, down six points compared with a
week ago. Overall, 57 per cent expect the Tories to be the largest party, against 29 per cent expecting Labour to be.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774903 Date: 08/31/2015
The public is deeply sceptical about the honesty of the parties. Only 4 per cent think that they are being completely
honest about their tax plans, 61 per cent partly honest. Only 6 per cent say they are being completely honest about
cutting the deficit and 61 per cent partly honest. Some 7 per cent say that they are being completely honest about the
extent to which they can fund their policies by cutting waste and 58 per cent partly honest.
Voters were asked to say which party had proposed eight key manifesto pledges. They wrongly identified four: reducing
the increase in national insurance contributions (naming Labour not the Tories); allowing unsuccessful schools, hospitals
and the police (the Tories, not Labour); tightening up takeover rules (the Tories not Labour); and requiring foreign
workers employed in public services to speak fluent English (the Tories not Labour).
In only one case, the £150-a-year tax break, did more than half of voters (60 per cent) correctly identify the party making
the proposal.
In most cases, the pledge will make little difference to people's votes, apart from three made by Labour: the foreign
workers language pledge, doubling paid paternity leave and allowing the takover of unsuccessful schools, hospitals etc.
More than two fifths (43 per cent), including 50 per cent of women, say "none of the parties", or "don't know", when
asked which party is putting across a convincing cases to voters. This compares with 25 per cent naming the Tories and
18 per cent Labour.
Just over half the public (54 per cent) plan to watch the first televised leaders' debate on Thursday evening. Men and
middle class professionals are more likely to say that they will view. More than two fifths (42 per cent) expect David
Cameron to win the debate, against 22 per cent for Gordon Brown. More Tories (70 per cent) than Labour voters ( 57
per cent) expect their leader to win.
Two fifths of the public (42 per cent, up one point on a week ago) say it seems like a change from Labour, but are not
sure that it is time for a change to the Conservatives. Some 33 per cent, down one point, think it is time for a change to
the Tories.
Populus interviewed a random sample of 1,525 adult voters on April 12 to 13. Interviews were conducted across the
country and have been weighted to be representative of all adults. For more details go to www.populus.co.uk.

What I still feel like is a bit of a mystery to me, though I know once Dalberg has the proposed final strategy, they will do

Dear Melanne,
It has been awhile since we have been in touch. As you now we are under special pressure at the Ukrainian
Catholic University. It is a question of our welfare and future. But not only. Almost no educational institutions have
taken a stand in defense of democracy and even western Ukrainian politicians are capitulating under pressure. So is
business. The approach of the new authorities is quick and systematic. Top and middle positions in all spheres of
government, administration, state security, police have been rapidly changed and are effectively moving in on the
freedom of the press and discourse.
Our students are scared.
Some are active, but some fear for the university, that it may loose accreditation. A father and his daughter-
student came to my office in a state of anxiety.
Some students are afraid to blog and post comments because they fear that they will be traced and that their
parents will loose their jobs.

There is clear evidence from one of our banks that the authorities are beginning to dig into the question of our

The most effective defense is speaking out.
I am grateful for your solicitude and wanted to ask for two things.
1 To ask the Secretary of State to bring this to the attention of the president and vice president and to do what
she can in our defense.
2. to help us get the story to some of the main media outlets: New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street
Journal, CNN, etc. One story by any of these for us and for the people in Ukraine that have the courage to speak the
truth is invaluable.
We have had some great support already. But I have a sense that this adventure is only beginning and we have
to be ready for everything.
Please pass on my respect to Secretary Clinton.

Netanyahu pleased: I didn't capitulate
Ben Caspit, Maariv, May 27 2010 [page 2 with front page lead; Hebrew original here
<http://www.scribd.com/doc/32038200/Maariv-May27-10-Netanyahu-Says-He-Beat-Obama> and at bottom of post] In
the course of intimate conversations over the past few weeks with top political officials and civil servants, Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has said, according to his interlocutors, that he managed to defeat the US administration.
Netanyahu is pleased by the fact that the Americans failed, so he said, to twist his arm and that ultimately, in the duel
between him and the Obama administration, he was the one who emerged with the upper hand. We did not make
concessions on our red lines and they failed to make us fold and to drag us to places we didn't want to go, said
Netanyahu, according to people who heard him speak.
Netanyahu is convinced that he is not going to be forced to extend the settlement construction freeze, which is due to
expire in September. According to senior officials in Jerusalem, an agreement has already been reached with the
administration that the Israeli government will not announce an extension of the construction freeze in the territories,
and the Americans will "make sure" that the Palestinians do not withdraw from the talks. Israel, however, will not take
"aggressive" action and construction will be resumed only in areas that are clearly within the consensus inside the
settlement blocs.
The Prime Minister's Bureau vigorously denied the above report. "The statements attributed to the prime minister are
incorrect," said a spokesman in the Prime Minister's Bureau. "They were not said by Netanyahu in any forum. The
reason is simple: the prime minister does not think that, Prime Minister Netanyahu holds in great esteem the
commitment by President Obama and the administration to Israel's security and their efforts to renew the peace
process in our region."
Eli Bardenstein adds: The formal invitation that Netanyahu received yesterday to meet with President Obama next week
might attest to a radical change in the White House's attitude towards him. Political sources in Israel described the
planned meeting as "the peak of the campaign for Israel and the Jews that has been pursued by the Obama
administration in the past number of weeks." The sources said that the meeting was geared to put an end to the grave
crisis that erupted some two months ago between the Obama administration and Netanyahu over the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict and particularly over the continued construction in East Jerusalem, and to mend the mistaken impression that
was received as if Israel was "no longer an absolute ally of the United States."
That crisis, which was initiated by the Americans, elicited fierce criticism in the United States, and sparked a desire
among members of the Obama administration to rectify the situation. Another reason for the administration's desire to
end the crisis is the fear of failure in the upcoming Congressional elections in November. "The Democratic Party's coffers
are empty. Many Democrat members of Congress and Senators have complained that if the hazing of Israel were to
continue, they would be unable to obtain donations from Jews and were liable to lose the elections," said one source in
Washington.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774925 Date: 08/31/2015
The prevalent assessment is that Netanyahu will be received far more warmly in Washington next week than he was two
months ago. This time the meeting will be covered by the media and the two leaders are expected to have their picture
taken together and to give statements to the media.
That said, sources in Washington noted that "Netanyahu is leery of the meeting with Obama and of walking into a trap
once again. He knows that the smiles notwithstanding, behind closed doors he is going to have to give answers to very
difficult questions, like 'how do you envision the end of the negotiations with the Palestinians."
Netanyahu is to begin his political travels today in Paris, where he is to attend the ceremony in honor of Israel's
acceptance into the OECD. The prime minister will be arriving in a city that is on strike, which is liable to impede his
movement through the city streets to the center of Paris for his meetings.

Gates Says U.S. Lacks Strategy to Curb Iran's Nuclear Drive
By DAVID E. SANGER and THOM SHANKER
Published: April 18, 2010 •
WASHINGTON - Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has warned in a secret three-page memorandum to top White
House officials that the United States does not have an effective long-range policy for dealing with Iran's steady progress
toward nuclear capability, according to government officials familiar with the document.
Several officials said the highly classified analysis, written in January to President Obama's national security adviser, Gen.
James L. Jones, touched off an intense effort inside the Pentagon, the White House and the intelligence agencies to
develop new options for Mr. Obama. They include a revised set of military alternatives, still under development, to be
considered should diplomacy and sanctions fail to force Iran to change course.
Officials familiar with the memo's contents would describe only portions dealing with strategy and policy, and not
sections that apparently dealt with secret operations against Iran, or how to deal with Persian Gulf allies.
One senior official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the memo,
described the document as "a wake-up call." But White House officials dispute that view, insisting that for 15 months
they had been conducting detailed planning for many possible outcomes regarding Iran's nuclear program.
In an interview on Friday, General Jones declined to speak about the memorandum. But he said: "On Iran, we are doing
what we said we were going to do. The fact that we don't announce publicly our entire strategy for the world to see
doesn't mean we don't have a strategy that anticipates the full range of contingencies - we do."
But in his memo, Mr. Gates wrote of a variety of concerns, including the absence of an effective strategy should Iran
choose the course that many government and outside analysts consider likely: Iran could assemble all the major parts it
needs for a nuclear weapon - fuel, designs and detonators - but stop just short of assembling a fully operational weapon.
In that case, Iran could remain a signatory of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty while becoming what strategists call a
"virtual" nuclear weapons state.
According to several officials, the memorandum also calls for new thinking about how the United States might contain
Iran's power if it decided to produce a weapon, and how to deal with the possibility that fuel or weapons could be
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774928 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774928 Date: 08/31/2015
obtained by one of the terrorist groups Iran has supported, which officials said they considered to be a less-likely
possibility.
Mr. Gates has never mentioned the memo in public. His spokesman, Geoff Morrell, declined comment on specifics in the
document, but issued a statement on Saturday saying, "The secretary believes the president and his national security
team have spent an extraordinary amount of time and effort considering and preparing for the full range of
contingencies with respect to Iran."
Pressed on the administration's ambiguous phrases until now about how close the United States was willing to allow
Iran's program to proceed, a senior administration official described last week in somewhat clearer terms that there was
a line Iran would not be permitted to cross.
The official said that the United States would ensure that Iran would not "acquire a nuclear capability," a step Tehran
could get to well before it developed a sophisticated weapon. "That includes the ability to have a breakout," he said,
using the term nuclear specialists apply to a country that suddenly renounces the nonproliferation treaty and uses its
technology to build a small arsenal.
Nearly two weeks ago, Mr. Obama, in an interview with The New York Times, was asked about whether he saw a
difference between a nuclear-capable Iran and one that had a fully developed weapon. "I'm not going to parse that right
now," he said. But he noted that North Korea was considered a nuclear-capable state until it threw out inspectors and,
as he said, "became a self-professed nuclear state."
Mr. Gates has alluded to his concern that intelligence agencies might miss signals that Iran was taking the final steps
toward producing a weapon. Last Sunday on the NBC News program "Meet the Press," he said: "If their policy is to go to
the threshold but not assemble a nuclear weapon, how do you tell that they have not assembled? I don't actually know
how you would verify that." But he cautioned that Iran had run into production difficulties, and he said, "It's going slow -
slower than they anticipated, but they are moving in that direction."
Mr. Gates has taken a crucial role in formulating the administration's strategy, and he has been known over his career to
issue stark warnings against the possibility of strategic surprise.
Some officials said his memo should be viewed in that light: as a warning to a relatively new president that the United
States was not adequately prepared.
He wrote the memo after Iran had let pass a 2009 deadline set by Mr. Obama to respond to his offers of diplomatic
engagement.
Both that process and efforts to bring new sanctions against Iran have struggled. Administration officials had hoped that
the revelation by Mr. Obama in September that Iran was building a new uranium enrichment plant inside a mountain
near Qum would galvanize other nations against Iran, but the reaction was muted. The next three months were spent in
what proved to be fruitless diplomatic talks with Iran over a plan to swap much of its low-enriched uranium for fuel for a
medical reactor in Tehran. By the time Mr. Gates wrote his memo, those negotiations had collapsed.
Mr. Gates's memo appears to reflect concerns in the upper echelons of the Pentagon and the military that the White
House did not have a well-prepared series of alternatives in place in case all the diplomatic steps finally failed. In fact,
just before Mr. Gates issued his warning, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, wrote an official
"chairman's guidance" to his staff saying that while any military option would have "limited results" against Iran's
nuclear facilities, preparations needed to be stepped up.
"Should the president call for military options, we must have them ready," the admiral wrote.
Administration officials testifying before a Senate committee last week made it clear that those preparations were under
way. So did General Jones. "The president has made it clear from the beginning of this administration that we need to be

prepared for every possible contingency," he said in the interview. "That is what we have done from day one, while
successfully building a coalition of nations to isolate Iran and pressure it to live up to its obligations."
At the same hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Lt. Gen. Ronald L. Burgess Jr., director of the Defense
Intelligence Agency, and Gen. James E. Cartwright, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and one of the military's
most experienced officers on nuclear matters, said that Iran could produce bomb-grade fuel for at least one nuclear
weapon within a year, but that it would probably need two to five years to manufacture a workable atomic bomb.
The administration has been stepping up efforts to contain the influence of Iran and counter its missiles, including
placing Patriot anti-missile batteries, mostly

There is clear evidence from one of our banks that the authorities are beginning to dig into the question of our
finances. Provocations, moral defamation, planting of drugs and weapons in student residences as happened in 2004
before the election could be next.
The most effective defense is speaking out.
I am grateful for your solicitude and wanted to ask for two things.
1 To ask the Secretary of State to bring this to the attention of the president and vice president and to do what
she can in our defense.
2. to help us get the story to some of the main media outlets: New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street
Journal, CNN, etc. One story by any of these for us and for the people in Ukraine that have the courage to speak the
truth is invaluable.
We have had some great support already. But I have a sense that this adventure is only beginning and we have
to be ready for everything.
Please pass on my respect to Secretary Clinton.
May God bless you!

Gates Says U.S. Lacks Strategy to Curb Iran's Nuclear Drive
By DAVID E. SANGER and THOM SHANKER
Published: April 18, 2010
WASHINGTON - Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has warned in a secret three-page memorandum to top White
House officials that the United States does not have an effective long-range policy for dealing with Iran's steady progress
toward nuclear capability, according to government officials familiar with the document.
Several officials said the highly classified analysis, written in January to President Obama's national security adviser, Gen.
James L. Jones, touched off an intense effort inside the Pentagon, the White House and the intelligence agencies to
develop new options for Mr. Obama. They include a revised set of military alternatives, still under development, to be
considered should diplomacy and sanctions fail to force Iran to change course.
Officials familiar with the memo's contents would describe only portions dealing with strategy and policy, and not
sections that apparently dealt with secret operations against Iran, or how to deal with Persian Gulf allies. •
One senior official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the memo,
described the document as "a wake-up call." But White House officials dispute that view, insisting that for 15 months
they had been conducting detailed planning for many possible outcomes regarding Iran's nuclear program.
In an interview on Friday, General Jones declined to speak about the memorandum. But he said: "On Iran, we are doing
what we said we were going to do. The fact that we don't announce publicly our entire strategy for the world to see
doesn't mean we don't have a strategy that anticipates the full range of contingencies - we do."
But in his memo, Mr. Gates wrote of a variety of concerns, including the absence of an effective strategy should Iran
choose the course that many government and outside analysts consider likely: Iran could assemble all the major parts it
needs for a nuclear weapon - fuel, designs and detonators - but stop just short of assembling a fully operational weapon.
In that case, Iran could remain a signatory of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty while becoming what strategists call a
"virtual" nuclear weapons state.
According to several officials, the memorandum also calls for new thinking about how the United States might contain
Iran's power if it decided to produce a weapon, and how to deal with the possibility that fuel or weapons could be

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774930 Date: 08/31/2015
obtained by one of the terrorist groups Iran has supported, which officials said they considered to be a less-likely
possibility.
Mr. Gates has never mentioned the memo in public. His spokesman, Geoff Morrell, declined comment on specifics in the
document, but issued a statement on Saturday saying, "The secretary believes the president and his national security
team have spent an extraordinary amount of time and effort considering and preparing for the full range of
contingencies with respect to Iran."
Pressed on the administration's ambiguous phrases until now about how close the United States was willing to allow
Iran's program to proceed, a senior administration official described last week in somewhat clearer terms that there was
a line Iran would not be permitted to cross.
The official said that the United States would ensure that Iran would not "acquire a nuclear capability," a step Tehran
could get to well before it developed a sophisticated weapon. "That includes the ability to have a breakout," he said,
using the term nuclear specialists apply to a country that suddenly renounces the nonproliferation treaty and uses its
technology to build a small arsenal.
Nearly two weeks ago, Mr. Obama, in an interview with The New York Times, was asked about whether he saw a
difference between a nuclear-capable Iran and one that had a fully developed weapon. "I'm not going to parse that right
now," he said. But he noted that North Korea was considered a nuclear-capable state until it threw out inspectors and,
as he said, "became a self-professed nuclear state."
Mr. Gates has alluded to his concern that intelligence agencies might miss signals that Iran was taking the final steps
toward producing a weapon. Last Sunday on the NBC News program "Meet the Press," he said: "If their policy is to go to
the threshold but not assemble a nuclear weapon, how do you tell that they have not assembled? I don't actually know
how you would verify that." But he cautioned that Iran had run into production difficulties, and he said, "It's going slow -
slower than they anticipated, but they are moving in that direction."
Mr. Gates has taken a crucial role in formulating the administration's strategy, and he has been known over his career to
issue stark warnings against the possibility of strategic surprise.
Some officials said his memo should be viewed in that light: as a warning to a relatively new president that the United
States was not adequately prepared.
He wrote the memo after Iran had let pass a 2009 deadline set by Mr. Obama to respond to his offers of diplomatic
engagement.
Both that process and efforts to bring new sanctions against Iran have struggled. Administration officials had hoped that
the revelation by Mr. Obama in September that Iran was building a new uranium enrichment plant inside a mountain
near Qum would galvanize other nations against Iran, but the reaction was muted. The next three months were spent in
what proved to be fruitless diplomatic talks with Iran over a plan to swap much of its low-enriched uranium for fuel for a
medical reactor in Tehran. By the time Mr. Gates wrote his memo, those negotiations had collapsed.
Mr. Gates's memo appears to reflect concerns in the upper echelons of the Pentagon and the military that the White
House did not have a well-prepared series of alternatives in place in case all the diplomatic steps finally failed. In fact,
just before Mr. Gates issued his warning, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, wrote an official
"chairman's guidance" to his staff saying that while any military option would have "limited results" against Iran's
nuclear facilities, preparations needed to be stepped up.
"Should the president call for military options, we must have them ready," the admiral wrote.
Administration officials testifying before a Senate committee last week made it clear that those preparations were under
way. So did General Jones. "The president has made it clear from the beginning of this administration that we need to be

prepared for every possible contingency," he said in the interview. "That is what we have done from day one, while
successfully building a coalition of nations to isolate Iran and pressure it to live up to its obligations."
At the same hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Lt. Gen. Ronald L. Burgess Jr., director of the Defense
Intelligence Agency, and Gen. James E. Cartwright, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and one of the military's
most experienced officers on nuclear matters, said that Iran could produce bomb-grade fuel for at least one nuclear
weapon within a year, but that it would probably need two to five years to manufacture a workable atomic bomb.
The administration has been stepping up efforts to contain the influence of Iran and counter its missiles, including
placing Patriot anti-missile batteries, mostly

I am headed back from China and I do not have S' email but I wanted to pass on this info regarding Father Charlie Beirne,
a friend to both of us and frmr Prez of LeMoyne College who is now at a hospice at Fordham University in the Bronx. He
greatly admires S and they always had a special relationship. We had planned for him to come down and have lunch w
us (incldg Mark Landler of the NYT who I have informed).
Charlie called me last night and he is stoic and brave but I think he would appreciate a call from S - who is simply admires
This is a Jesuit that showed his bravery by calling the Secy General of the Jesuits to ask to replace his Jesuit friend who
had been massacred (along w others) by the military at a University in Central America.

Dear Trustees and Trustee Associates,
I am writing to share an update on Fr. Beirne's health. Fr. Beirne called this morning to let me know that his cancer has
reached a stage where he has made the decision not to have any further clinical intervention. He prefers to live out the
time he has remaining, six months by the doctors' projections, without the sapping of his energy and other side effects
posed by his recent treatments. I have his permission to share this sad news with you. You may write to Fr. Beirne at
Murray-Weigel Hall where he is now living (see address below) or phone him on his cell phone at

I am sure that you join me in offering prayers for Fr. Beirne as he faces the challenges his illness presents in his final

Breaking down barriers

FISA Foundation retiring executive director Dee Delaney, left, with the new executive director, Kristy Trautmann.
To people in the local disability community, Dee Delaney is a household name.
When news came this spring of her intention to retire as executive director of FISA Foundation in August, one could
almost hear a collective gasp. With 14 years at the helm of the small but influential foundation, Ms. Delaney has had a
pronounced and lasting influence on quality of life in our region.
On behalf of FISA, Ms. Delaney has changed the local landscape not only by funding projects with far-reaching results,
but by bringing people together to craft solutions to longstanding problems and by becoming personally involved in
many of the projects the foundation funds.
She became the first executive director of FISA Foundation when it began in 1996 with proceeds from the sale of
Harmarville Rehabilitation Center, a nonprofit, to HealthSouth, a for-profit organization.
The new foundation would continue the mission of the Federation of Independent School Alumnae, an organization that
opened a convalescent home for women in 1911 and the Harmarville Rehabilitation Center in 1954. That mission was to
improve the lives of women, girls and people with disabilities in Western Pennsylvania.
Ms. Delaney, who had been involved with Harmarville since 1980 -- starting as a volunteer and ending as development
director of its foundation -- sought the job of leading FISA. "I realized the impact the foundation could have. FISA is not a
large foundation, but it's a very focused foundation," she said.
Over the past 14 years, FISA's endowment has grown to more than $38 million. Over $17 million has been granted to
726 projects in 298 organizations.
A roll call of projects funded by FISA reflects progressive thinking about including of people with disabilities in all aspects
of life, especially access to health care. Programs have become national models.
Women with disabilities, for example, often encounter barriers in typical healthcare settings. Standard exam tables and
diagnostic equipment were designed for the able-bodied, and medical staff often struggle to accommodate individuals
with special needs. FISA provided the seed money for the Center for Women with Disabilities at Magee-Womens
Hospital of UPMC, one of the first such clinics in the nation. FISA is involved in the overall issue of improving access to
healthcare for people with disabilities.
Likewise, people with disabilities have difficulty obtaining dental care. A FISA-funded project at Achieva is creating
statewide, systemic solutions. FISA also provided support for the Center for Patients with Special Needs at Pitt's School
of Dental Medicine.
FISA has also taken the lead on training arts and cultural venues how to make events more accessible and helping places
of worship more welcoming.
"Dee is a national leader in the field. If there were more people like her, we wouldn't have the issues we have," said Kim
Hutchinson, executive director of the Disability Funders Network, based in Virginia. Ms. Delaney has been a board officer
for the group since 2004.

Nancy Murray, president of the ARC of Greater Pittsburgh, said the issues Ms. Delaney has helped solve are ones that
people have been working on for years.
"People talk about strategies, but never move forward to solutions. Dee brings all the stakeholders together to get to
the solutions," said Ms. Murray.
"I think Dee has greatly influenced the next generation of nonprofit and philanthropic leaders, leading by example on
the value of true collaboration," said Susie Chase, a board member of FISA and former executive director of Working
Order, a FISA grantee.
"With Dee, it is never about her own role, or FISA's role, it is always about unmet needs in the community and the work
that needs to be done. That seems to bring out the best in every partner, and in everyone who has the privilege of
working with her."
Ms. Chase added that advice and technical assistance Ms. Delaney provided to Working Order "were of equal or greater
value to the organization than the grant funds."
"I still, after many years, never come away from a meeting with Dee that I haven't learned something, been inspired to
work harder, and understood more clearly the value of someone else's ideas and efforts."
In her retirement, Ms. Delaney plans to "give back to the community in new ways," she said. A new frontier is helping
young people with disabilities prepare for employment and leadership. "We have to keep the fire burning."
On May 19, FISA announced that Kristy Trautmann, who has served as the foundation's program director for six years,
was promoted to executive director.
"We sought a person who would follow Ms. Delaney's visionary leadership and guide the foundation into the next
decade," said Jane Burger, who chaired the search committee. "We know that we have found such a person in Kristy
Trautmann. She understands the challenges facing the populations the foundation supports and has the trust of the
board and the community."

Subject: Secretary's Video Speech
Kurt:
You'll be happy to know that the Secretary's video message was the subject of a great op-ed in today's Thai Rath, the
leading newspaper in Thailand. They took exactly the line that we hoped they would — seeing her message not as the
U.S. intervening in politics, but, rather, as a very personal message from someone who cares deeply about Thailand. The
writer even referred to the Secretary's autobiography.
Thai Rath (leading Thai language daily), a commentary on Thai politics, April 16, referenced Secretary Clinton's video
statement calling for a peaceful solution to Thailand's political crisis: "I would like to thank U.S. Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton for making a request herself and on behalf of President Obama for the two opposing parties to return to the
negotiating table so as to end their conflict. The short video message in which she mentioned Thailand was full of
sincerity. She started by saying that she was making this request as "a long-standing friend of the Thai people" She
referred to the Songkran festival which is the Thai New Year and said the opposing parties should consider this an
opportunity for a new round of talks. She emphasized that violence cannot bring happiness and peace and that the
opposing parties should talk in order to solve the problem. I believe Mrs. Clinton said this with sincerity. I have read a
book in which she wrote about her brief visit to Thailand as First Lady several years ago and showed her goodwill toward
the Thai people and Thailand in the book. During her most recent visit to Thailand last year, Mrs. Clinton gave an
interview and expressed her opinion about Thai politics in the most amicable way. Normally, I do not quite approve of
the U.S. because I think it often meddles with other countries' affairs. But I wholeheartedly agree with Secretary
Clinton's request and would like to sincerely thank her for it." (To see the video, click here.

I wanted to give you some brief observations from my trip to Lithuania. First of all, their friendship with the US and
respect for you was much in evidence on all levels. Most of the cabinet turned out for the reception that the amb hosted
for me. The FM went out his way to tell me what it meant to get a call from you when he assumed his position (he's
hoping to have a few mins with you in Tallin). As far as Lith has to go, it has achieved some remarkable achievements for
Eastern Eur. They have a female president, Speaker, Finance minister and def. minister. I had a good meeting with the
President and thanked her for Lith commitment to our collective efforts in afghanistan. They run the smallest PRT and,
despite a tough economy, have done everything we've asked in terms of additional support since the surge. The meeting
with the Speaker and top women members of the parl'nt was yet another reminder of your inspiration over many years.
One of the women was at the Vienna VV conf and said she's in politics today because of you. Another read about safe
birthing kits in your book and was inspired to send several thousand to Afghanistan. They are eager for more
opportunities to work together.
I came primarily to launch the new working group on gender that we and Lith are co-chairing. There was much gratitude
for our leadership with them in the Community of Democracies.
The meaning of democracy is so strong for people who had to stuggle for it more recently. They really feel this is an
important time to renew the understanding of democ, particularly after the bruising it underwent over the last several
years.
We had terrific turnout from other countries, many comments about you and references to Beijing and Iceland VV conf.
(So many people told me the impact Vienna and Iceland had on them). We left our meeting with many commitments for
future concrete projects that will be undertaken. There is great hope that you will be in Krakow in July for the CD
ministerial. The Lith CD coordinator headed to Belgium the next day for an EU meeting. He told me he got a very positive
response for our gender initiative and that Ashton was particularly excited about it. The EU is locating their new gender
institute in Lithuania and they are ager for our help.
The Dutch minister who came
said the outcome of their election in June will say much about the nature of their ongoing commitment in Afg.
Lastly, I arrived shortly after the Polish tragedy. There is a very close relationship between the 2 countries and their grief
was palpable. Jolenta Kwasniewska and several other Poles came to the CD meeting. She told me that they lost so many
of their top leaders across all sectors of society, incl several top women leaders. Jolenta' foundation has been very active
in advancing women's progress in Poland as well as working in other countries.

Joint Statement by Former President Clinton and Secretary of State Clinton on the Passing of Dr. Dorothy Height We are
deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Dr. Dorothy. Height, an icon of America's long march toward equality and a
personal inspiration to us both. As the only woman among the "Big Six" civil rights leaders, Dr. Height helped galvanize a
movement that changed our country forever. She organized the "Wednesdays in Mississippi" meetings that brought
black and white women together to find common ground and break down barriers. She never stopped fighting for what
she knew was right. And through it all, she was always the best dressed woman in the room. We were blessed to know
Dr. Height, to benefit from her grace, passion and wisdom, and to call her our friend. For decades, starting with the early
days at the Children's Defense Fund, we worked with her, learned from her, and drew inspiration from her example.
From the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to the Congressional Gold Medal, to the unveiling of a long-sought-after bust
of Sojourner Truth in the United States Capitol, we had the privilege of helping honor Dr. Height and her
accomplishments. Born before women had the right to vote, denied access to the college of her choice because of the
color of her skin, and witness to nation divided, Dr. Height dedicated her life to the proposition that all Americans should
have the opportunity to live up to their full God-given potential. Our nation is poorer for her loss but infinitely richer for
the life she led, the progress she achieved, and the people she touched. Our thoughts and prayers are with Dr. Height's
family today, and with her many loving friends and colleagues. She would be the first to tell us that the best way to
honor her memory is to carry forward the work she started and the causes she championed, to open wide the freedom
gates. May we all find the strength and the wisdom to live up to her legacy.

Background All this separate from Simon's broader system(s) potential. Jim (James F.)Blom is Dave's former business
partner in Alacrity Homeland Group. Lives in San Francisco w/ wife and 2 kids. American, but well healed due to long
family history in Norwegian shipping companies. Grandfather was pals with Onassis. You get the picture. Has tight
linkage in supply chain & IT space(s). Deals in countries like you and I dealt with counties / states. Brilliant, resourceful.
Not prone to hyperbole, says he can bring the 'best in the world' to this effort Based on track record , I believe him. For
example, CdeBaca recently met with social networking folks in Silicon Valley. Not sure how that went, but Jim is close
friends with the guy who handles 'Facebook's' finances and said he can get his attention 'in one phone call'. Social
networking piece helpful, but probably a more aggressive 'identify, track, snag, deal with' traffickers required. Method(s)
& prioritization necessary. Let's look into. Spoke w/ Jim about CdeBaca connect. We're in. Best, Marty

Statement by the Secretary
Murders in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico
Today the men and women of the Department of State are mourning the murder of three people connected to the
United States Consulate General in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. One American consulate employee was killed along with her
husband, and the husband of a Mexican employee was also killed. I offer my deepest sympathies to the family, loved
ones and colleagues of these victims. The safety and security of our personnel and their families in Mexico and at posts
around the world is always our highest priority. I have spoken with our Ambassador in Mexico and we are working with
the Government of Mexico to do everything necessary to protect our people and to ensure that the perpetrators of
these horrendous acts are brought to justice.
These appalling assaults on members of our own State Department family are, sadly, part of a growing tragedy besetting
many communities in Mexico. They underscore the imperative of our continued commitment to work closely with the
Government of President CalderOn to cripple the influence of trafficking organizations at work in Mexico. This is a
responsibility we must shoulder together, particularly in border communities where strong bonds of history, culture,
and common interest bind the Mexican and the American people closely together.

Hi Hillary,
I am back from the unpredictable and exciting elections in Britain.
Congratulations on all the good things you are doing at State.
You have so many fans from Manmohan Singh, who smiled broadly when we talked about you, to those women who
never stop dreaming.
I would love to catch up. I have to be in DC from the 12th-15th May, in case you have any time to sneak away for a few
minutes.
I understand it may not be possible, but thought I would check.
In any event, I remain your loyal adoring pal.

Here is a weekend factoid for you: among all living politicians in the United States who have ever held elected office,
Hillary Clinton the most popular.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775004 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775004 Date: 08/31/2015
That's right. Ever since she became Secretary of State, her favorables have soared into the mid-60's
<http://www.pollingreport.com/C2.htm#Hillary>, putting her well clear of any other statewide officeholder in the
country. The only national figures who are viewed as favorably as Clinton are Michelle Obama
<http://www.pollingreport.com/o.htm#Michelle>, Colin Powell <http://www.pollingreport.com/p.htm#Powell>, and
David Patraeus <http://www.pollingreport.com/p.htm#Petraeus>. However, they have never run for office, which
invariably lowers your favorables.
Hillary Clinton will turn 69 in in the final week of the 2016 campaign, which makes her slightly younger than Ronald
Reagan when he first was elected in 1980. Also, as Secretary of State, a major presidential candidate, a U.S. Senator,
and First Lady, she is also probably more credentialed than any other potential Presidential candidate, too. There is
even talk she may become the next Secretary of Defense <http://www.politico.com/news/stories/O51O/37672.html>,
further adding to her credentials.
Some have said that, in choosing Joe Biden as Vice-President, Barack Obama did not pick a successor to lead the
Democratic Party. However, that needs rethinking. Because Barack Obama made her Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton
remains remarkably well-positioned to run for President in 2016, even more so than she was in 2008.
Anyway, have a good holiday weekend.

Ma'am -- Jake tells me that you are tired of the Lamplighter story. I'm sorry, I didn't know. But the Belfast people have
come up with a FANTASTIC story -- apparently, as per your request, they have tracked down the two kids who won the
peace essay contest in the 90s, and they are doing great things -- one is a teacher, one is a police officer. They are now
reaching out to get permission for you to tell their stories tomorrow night; assuming they will grant it, I am writing up
their stories now and will fax a revised draft to you shortly.
Sorry for the Lamplighter redux; I'll let Lissa know it's off-limits for at least a few years.

Cheryl,
Local media drew attention this weekend to the line in the introduction of our annual human rights report that
refers to the GOH by saying that there is severe corruption in all branches of government. called this
morning asking for a copy of the report (which we sent him), saying that the President was upset and wanted to read it.
The Embassy human rights officer sent the Department a first draft of this report late last year. It normally would have
gone through two or three more versions with input from DRL and ultimately clearance by the Embassy Front Office.

finish the report. The final draft was never sent to us for clearance/comments and I don't know who all in the
Department cleared off on it. You may already be familiar with the report, but in the event you are not, I wanted you to

Under Secretary McHale:
This week we have seen the most extraordinary series of public attacks on the United States by Lt Gen (ret) Hamid Gul, a
noted anti-American crackpot who derives his role as an "expert analyst" by being the only former Inter-Services
Intelligence (151) Chief who ever appears on TV. Gul was briefly ISI chief during PM Bhutto's first term in office almost 20
years ago. Appearing on several TV stations this week, Gul has repeated allegations that the U.S. is implicated in the
Bhutto Assassination — the subject is current this week because of the release of the U.N. report on the assassination,
which is itself a remarkable document.
One ironic element of the UN report on the assassination is the report that on October 16, 2007 former PM Bhutto
wrote to General Musharraf that the very same Hamid Gul was one of three people she considered a threat to her
security. (see excerpt below) This fact came up in none of the programs.
Our view is that the television journalists and executives now must begin taking responsibility for putting inciting and
unsubstantiated claims on the air. We have released the attached "Correction," which will be seen by news editors
across the country.

Excerpt from the UN report on the Bhutto assassination:
179. On 16 October 2007, Ms Bhutto writing from Dubai to General Musharraf, identified three people she considered a
threat to her security: (i) Brigadier (ret) Ejaz Shah, Director General of the IB at the time of the assassination, (ii) General
(ret) Hamid Gul, a former Director General of the ISI, and (iii) Mr Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi, Chief Minister of Punjab until
22 November 2007.

Hillary and Cheryl,
I'm feeling very good about our recent efforts to connect our speeches thematically. We've done it with development,
human rights, and Internet freedom; and most recently with AIPAC, Ctr for Middle East Peace, and next the AJC. Here's
what I want to suggest: The three most basic elements of human existence are food, water, and health. We have now
done major speeches on food and water. I'd like us to consider a major speech on global health — the third in a trilogy.
Linking these three issues thematically, we can explain how and why foreign policy challenges and solutions must be
seen through a prism of human survival and why the conditions of people's lives influence everything from economic
development to political stability and more. This trilogy of speeches (with the right PR) could further underscore our
elevation of development AND our comprehensive, smart power approach to foreign policy. After all, food, water, and
health are the sine qua non of human progress. And this is a Hillary Clinton signature idea, at least to me. Thoughts?

Dear Cheryl—
In my last email (Friday, 5/28), I attached the letter from the bipartisan Co-Chairs and Executive Committee members of
the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission sent to Assistant Secretary Mike Posner expressing grave concern about the
recent rise in death threats, attacks and murders of Colombian human rights defenders, religious, community and other
NGO leaders. Congressman McGovern also strongly encouraged the Secretary to meet with representatives of those
organizations and individuals being threatened, with a particularly effort to reach out to and invite the Bishops of
Tumaco (Narifio), Barrancabermeja/Medio Magdalena (Santander), and we would now add Putumayo, since the
Colombian Catholic Church just advised us yesterday of increased death threats against religious workers there. In
addition, we recommended inviting Monserior Hector Fabio Henao, director of Pastoral Social, at the Archdiocese in
Bogota, who represents all the pastoral work of the Church throughout the country, as well as representatives from the
Mennonite and Lutheran churches, in particular.
While in Colombia, the most important thing the Secretary can do is avoid effusive praise for President Alvaro Uribe,
who leaves office in August. Inside Colombia, the visit by the Secretary is being described as focusing solely on the free
trade agreement and continuing support of the counterdrug strategy/Plan Colombia. Without changes in the human
rights situation and the culture of impunity, it is unlikely that anything the Secretary might say or do will alter the
equation on Capitol Hill regarding the trade agreement. It should be noted that the October 2008 GAO report on the
counter-drug operations in Colombia concluded that U.S. assistance was successful in increasing security in parts of the
country, but a failure in the areas of counter-narcotics (GAO-09-71) , and a subsequent April 2009 USAID evaluation on
U.S. aid for Plan Colombia for illegal crop reduction and Colombian counternarcotics policies actually contribute to
increased coca production.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775057 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775057 Date: 08/31/2015
The Colombian president has been a solid backer of U.S. policy and U.S. interests in the region, and has achieved some
important improvements in the country's security situation. It is important to recognize that, but to do so without
repeating the tone of Defense Secretary Gates' April visit, in which he called Uribe a "great hero"
<http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=58754> and failed even to mention any concerns.
These concerns are of critical importance, and while the Secretary need not list them all, at least some deserve public
acknowledgement — some recognition that it is important to the United States that Colombia, including the current
government and its successor, show the necessary political will to deal with them:
A sharp rise in alleged military killings of civilians. In many cases, these are so-called "false positives": non-
combatants murdered and later presented as members of armed groups killed in combat. These, notes
<http://www.extrajudicialexecutions.org/colombia> UN Special Rapporter for Extrajudicial Executions Philip Alston,
"began occurring with a disturbing frequency across Colombia from 2004." Citing prosecutors' and NGOs' reports, Alston
indicates that Colombia's security forces may have killed 1,486 civilians during the first six years of Alvaro Uribe's
presidency. Alston notes that the Defense Ministry only began to address the situation after the media broke the story
of the false-positives and the subsequent negative publicity and horrified public outcry.
The prosecution of "false positives" is moving with excruciating slowness. In perhaps the most notorious case —the
murders of about twenty young men from the poor Bogota suburb of Soacha — nearly all of the accused soldiers and
officers have been released from prison <http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=49968>, pending trial, as
deadlines for timely prosecution have run out. Since their arrest in late 2008, their case has been prolonged by
numerous delaying tactics by the defense, including attempts to have their cases tried in the military court system as
"acts of service." Alston reports that the impunity rate on these extrajudicial murders by security forces may be as high
as 98.5 percent.
Mounting allegations that the President's intelligence service, the DAS, was put at the service
<http://www.cipcol.org/?p=1123> of paramilitary leaders and narcotraffickers; used to spy on and intimidate
<http://www.cipcol.org/?p=752> Supreme Court justices, opposition politicians, journalists and human rights
defenders; and employed in a campaign of sabotage and smears <http://www.cipcol.org/?p=1467> against political
opponents.
Prosecutors are alleging that the orders to have the DAS carry out wiretaps, surveillance and "political warfare" came
from high up in the Colombian presidency <http://www.caracoltv.com/noticias/justicia/articulo168592-tres-asesores-
de-uribe-son-investigados-chuzadas-ilegales> , though the question of "what President Uribe knew, and when he knew
it" remains unanswered. Meanwhile efforts to reform or dissolve the DAS are stalled in Colombia's Congress.
President Uribe's political coalition has also been hit by a scandal known in Colombia as "para-politics." This
•
coalition has included dozens of political bosses from regions beyond the capital. Many are large landholders with ties to
narcotrafficking, the same local leaders who created and fostered the brutal pro-government paramilitary groups that
killed tens of thousands of non-combatants in the 1990s and early 2000s.
Evidence, much of it from former paramilitary leaders, has brought about 300 criminal investigations against legislators,
governors, mayors and other local officials, nearly all of them Alvaro Uribe's political supporters, who made common
cause with the far-right warlords. To date, of the 278 congresspeople and senators elected in 2006, 68
<http://www.nuevoarcoiris.org.co/sac/?q=node/64> are under official investigation, on trial, or convicted for
paramilitary ties. Those embroiled in parapolitics include the President's cousin, Mario Uribe; the brother of his former
foreign minister; and individuals whom the President had named to be Colombia's ambassadors to Chile, the Dominican
Republic, and Canada.
The Colombian prosecutors, investigators, witnesses and non-governmental organizations trying to uncover the truth
about these abuses are working under conditions of great personal risk. They, too, are heroes and would benefit greatly
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775057 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775057 Date: 08/31/2015
from a public expression of concern about the cases they are investigating, and a reminder that their work is legitimate
and important to U.S. interests in Colombia.
At the same time, it is important to avoid appearing to endorse any candidate in the June 20 runoff elections. Between
the first and second rounds of a country's presidential election is a politically awkward time for a high-level official visit.
Though President Uribe's former defense minister, Juan Manuel Santos, is the overwhelming favorite given his margin of
success in the May 30th first round of balloting over former Bogota mayor Antanas Mockus, it is necessary at this stage
to convey a sense of balance and a willingness to work closely with whoever wins. As a result, any kind words for one
candidate should be balanced by praise for the other.
Finally, it would be helpful to remind the Colombian people that the United States supports a peaceful resolution of
Bogota's worsening differences with Venezuela. While President Chavez's behavior is a significant concern, it would be
most unhelpful to be perceived on this trip as fanning the flames of conflict with Colombia — or playing into the Chavez
rhetoric that the U.S. and Colombia have military aspirations in the region.
Hope this memo, along with last week's copy of the TLHRC letter to Assistant Secretary Posner, are helpful and useful
materials for the Secretary as she plans her trip.
Very best wishes —
On behalf of Cong. Jim McGovern

Obama Backs Down on Sudan
By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF
JUBA, Sudan
Until he reached the White House, Barack Obama repeatedly insisted that the United States apply more pressure on
Sudan so as to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe in Darfur and elsewhere.
Yet, as president, Mr. Obama and his aides have caved, leaving Sudan gloating at American weakness. Western
monitors, Sudanese journalists and local civil society groups have all found this month's Sudanese elections to be deeply
flawed - yet Mr. Obama's special envoy for Sudan, Maj. Gen. Scott Gration, pre-emptively defended the elections, saying
they would be "as free and as fair as possible." The White House showed only a hint more backbone with a hurried
reference this week to "an essential step" with "serious irregularities."
President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan - the man wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against
humanity in Darfur - has been celebrating. His regime calls itself the National Congress Party, or N.C.P., and he was
quoted in Sudan as telling a rally in the Blue Nile region: "Even America is becoming an N.C.P. member. No one is against
our will."
Memo to Mr. Obama: When a man who has been charged with crimes against humanity tells the world that America is
in his pocket, it's time to review your policy.
Perhaps the Obama administration caved because it considers a flawed election better than no election. That's a
reasonable view, one I share. It's conceivable that Mr. Bashir could have won a quasi-fair election - oil revenues have
manifestly raised the standard of living in parts of Sudan - and the campaigning did create space for sharp criticism of
the government.
It's also true that Sudan has been behaving better in some respects.

The death toll in Darfur is hugely reduced, and the government is negotiating with rebel groups there. The Sudanese
government gave me a visa and travel permits to Darfur, allowing me to travel legally and freely.
The real game isn't, in fact, Darfur or the elections but the maneuvering for a possible new civil war. The last north-south
civil war in Sudan ended with a fragile peace in 2005, after some two million deaths. The peace agreement provided for
a referendum, scheduled to take place in January, in which southern Sudanese will decide whether to secede. They are
expected to vote overwhelmingly to form a separate country.
Then the question becomes: will the north allow South Sudan to separate? The south holds the great majority of the
country's oil, and it's difficult to see President Bashir allowing oil fields to walk away.
"If the result of the referendum is independence, there is going to be war - complete war," predicts Mudawi Ibrahim
Adam, one of Sudan's most outspoken human rights advocates. He cautions that America's willingness to turn a blind
eye to election-rigging here increases the risk that Mr. Bashir will feel that he can get away with war.
"They're very naïve in Washington," Mr. Mudawi said. "They don't understand what is going on."
On the other hand, a senior Sudanese government official, Ghazi Salahuddin, told me unequivocally in Khartoum, the
nation's capital, that Sudan will honor the referendum results. And it's certainly plausible that north and south will
muddle through and avoid war, for both sides are exhausted by years of fighting.
Here in Juba, the South Sudan capital, I met Winnie Wol, 26, who fled the civil war in 1994 after a militia from the north
attacked her village to kill, loot, rape and burn. Her father and many relatives were killed, but she escaped and made her
way to Kenya - and eventually resettled as a refugee in California. She now lives in Olathe, Kan., and she had returned
for the first time to Sudan to visit a mother and sisters she had last seen when she was a little girl.
Ms. Wol, every bit the well-dressed American, let me tag along for her journey back to her village of Nyamlell, 400 miles
northwest of Juba.
The trip ended by a thatch-roof but that belonged to her mother, who didn't know she was coming - so no one was
home. Ms. Wol was crushed.
Then there was a scream and a woman came running. It was Ms. Wol's mother, somehow recognizing her, and they flew
•into each other's arms.
To me, it felt like a peace dividend.
Yet that peace is fragile, and Ms. Wol knows that the northern forces may come back to pillage again. "I don't want
war," she said, "but I don't think they will allow us to separate."
My own hunch is that the north hasn't entirely decided what to do, and that strong international pressure can reduce
the risk of another savage war. If President Obama is ever going to find his voice on Sudan, it had better be soon.

Subject: Brief memo for Cheryl Mills on Colombia - for Secretary Clinton
Dear Cheryl—
In my last email (Friday, 5/28), I attached the letter from the bipartisan Co-Chairs and Executive Committee members of
the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission sent to Assistant Secretary Mike Posner expressing grave concern about the
recent rise in death threats, attacks and murders of Colombian human rights defenders, religious, community and other
NGO leaders. Congressman McGovern also strongly encouraged the Secretary to meet with representatives of those
organizations and individuals being threatened, with a particularly effort to reach out to and invite the Bishops of
Tumaco (Narifio), Barrancabermeja/Medio Magdalena (Santander), and we would now add Putumayo, since the
Colombian Catholic Church just advised us yesterday of increased death threats against religious workers there. In
addition, we recommended inviting Monsefior Hector Fabio Henao, director of Pastoral Social, at the Archdiocese in
Bogota, who represents all the pastoral work of the Church throughout the country, as well as representatives from the
Mennonite and Lutheran churches, in particular.
While in Colombia, the most important thing the Secretary can do is avoid effusive praise for President Alvaro Uribe,
who leaves office in August. Inside Colombia, the visit by the Secretary is being described as focusing solely on the free
trade agreement and continuing support of the counterdrug strategy/Plan Colombia. Without changes in the human
rights situation and the culture of impunity, it is unlikely that anything the Secretary might say or do will alter the
equation on Capitol Hill regarding the trade agreement. It should be noted that the October 2008 GAO report on the
counter-drug operations in Colombia concluded that U.S. assistance was successful in increasing security in parts of the
country, but a failure in the areas of counter-narcotics (GAO-09-71) , and a subsequent April 2009 USAID evaluation on
U.S. aid for Plan Colombia for illegal crop reduction and Colombian counternarcotics policies actually contribute to
increased coca production.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775063 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775063 Date: 08/31/2015
The Colombian president has been a solid backer of U.S. policy and U.S. interests in the region, and has achieved some
important improvements in the country's security situation. It is important to recognize that, but to do so without
repeating the tone of Defense Secretary Gates' April visit, in which he called Uribe a "great hero"
<http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=58754> and failed even to mention any concerns.
These concerns are of critical importance, and while the Secretary need not list them all, at least some deserve public
acknowledgement some recognition that it is important to the United States that Colombia, including the current
government and its successor, show the necessary political will to deal with them:
A sharp rise in alleged military killings of civilians. In many cases, these are so-called "false positives": non-
combatants murdered and later presented as members of armed groups killed in combat. These, notes
<http://www.extrajudicialexecutions.org/colombia> UN Special Rapporter for Extrajudicial Executions Philip Alston,
"began occurring with a disturbing frequency across Colombia from 2004." Citing prosecutors' and NGOs' reports, Alston
indicates that Colombia's security forces may have killed 1,486 civilians during the first six years of Alvaro Uribe's
presidency. Alston notes that the Defense Ministry only began to address the situation after the media broke the story
of the false-positives and the subsequent negative publicity and horrified public outcry.
The prosecution of "false positives" is moving with excruciating slowness. In perhaps the most notorious case — the
murders of about twenty young men from the poor Bogota suburb of Soacha — nearly all of the accused soldiers and
officers have been released from prison <http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=49968>, pending trial, as
deadlines for timely prosecution have run out. Since their arrest in late 2008, their case has been prolonged by
numerous delaying tactics by the defense, including attempts to have their cases tried in the military court system as
"acts of service." Alston reports that the impunity rate on these extrajudicial murders by security forces may be as high
as 98.5 percent.
Mounting allegations that the President's intelligence service, the DAS, was put at the service
<http://www.cipcol.org/?p=1123> of paramilitary leaders and narcotraffickers; used to spy on and intimidate
<http://www.cipcol.org/?p=752> Supreme Court justices, opposition politicians, journalists and human rights
defenders; and employed in a campaign of sabotage and smears <http://www.cipcol.org/?p=1467> against political
opponents.
Prosecutors are alleging that the orders to have the DAS carry out wiretaps, surveillance and "political warfare" came
from high up in the Colombian presidency <http://www.caracoltv.com/noticias/justicia/articulo168592-tres-asesores-
de-uribe-son-investigados-chuzadas-ilegales> , though the question of "what President Uribe knew, and when he knew
it" remains unanswered. Meanwhile efforts to reform or dissolve the DAS are stalled in Colombia's Congress.
President Uribe's political coalition has also been hit by a scandal known in Colombia as "para-politics." This
coalition has included dozens of political bosses from regions beyond the capital. Many are large landholders with ties to
narcotrafficking, the same local leaders who created and fostered the brutal pro-government paramilitary groups that
killed tens of thousands of non-combatants in the 1990s and early 2000s.
Evidence, much of it from former paramilitary leaders, has brought about 300 criminal investigations against legislators,
governors, mayors and other local officials, nearly all of them Alvaro Uribe's political supporters, who made common
cause with the far-right warlords. To date, of the 278 congresspeople and senators elected in 2006, 68
<http://www.nuevoarcoiris.org.co/sac/?q=node/64> are under official investigation, on trial, or convicted for
paramilitary ties. Those embroiled in parapolitics include the President's cousin, Mario Uribe; the brother of his former
foreign minister; and individuals whom the President had named to be Colombia's ambassadors to Chile, the Dominican
Republic, and Canada.
The Colombian prosecutors, investigators, witnesses and non-governmental organizations trying to uncover the truth
about these abuses are working under conditions of great personal risk. They, too, are heroes and would benefit greatly
from a public expression of concern about the cases they are investigating, and a reminder that their work is legitimate
and important to U.S. interests in Colombia.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775063 Date: 08/31/2015
At the same time, it is important to avoid appearing to endorse any candidate in the June 20 runoff elections. Between
the first and second rounds of a country's presidential election is a politically awkward time for a high-level official visit.
Though President Uribe's former defense minister, Juan Manuel Santos, is the overwhelming favorite given his margin of
success in the May 30th first round of balloting over former Bogota mayor Antanas Mockus, it is necessary at this stage
to convey a sense of balance and a willingness to work closely with whoever wins. As a result, any kind words for one
candidate should be balanced by praise for the other.
Finally, it would be helpful to remind the Colombian people that the United States supports a peaceful resolution of
Bogota's worsening differences with Venezuela. While President Chavez's behavior is a significant concern, it would be
most unhelpful to be perceived on this trip as fanning the flames of conflict with Colombia — or playing into the Chavez
rhetoric that the U.S. and Colombia have military aspirations in the region.
Hope this memo, along with last week's copy of the TLHRC letter to Assistant Secretary Posner, are helpful and useful
materials for the Secretary as she plans her trip.
Very best wishes —
On behalf of Cong. Jim McGovern

Dear Cheryl —
It's our understanding that the review of the terrorist list undertaken at the beginning of the year is reaching
completion, imminently. Jim asked me to shoot you a note that this continues to be a very important issue for him and
Bill Delahunt. The list needs to be purged of political manipulation — and quite frankly, the current status quo with Cuba
needs to be broken, not further reinforced — for the sake of Alan Gross, those on the island needing space to voice their
views, and indeed, all of us outside who know change is coming.
It's time to do something bold and constructive — and in our very best interests —
Let us know if there's anything we can do to help —

Administration. The letter cites Cuba as a nation that should be purged from such lists, including the State Sponsors of
Terrorism list, as an example for the need of a thorough, robust and judicious review and updating of these lists.
Can you please ensure that the Secretary and other relevant State Department officials are made aware of this letter?

Subject: tying up a couple of loose ends from this week
You mentioned at Thursday's 8:45 meeting that you had talked to Qureshi and that he thought he was not going to get
any trade access to the EU. My EU contact writes that the Member States in the EU have been slowing up progress on
trade concessions to Pakistan, although the draft language negotiated w/ Pakistan still leaves room for the Commission
(which is pro-trade) to keep working on enhanced trade benefits for Pakistan. Still, the original timetable of 2011 will not
be kept. Even more ominous, any agreement will have to go to the European Parliament, which is down on Pakistan for
human rights reasons.
I have also read Esther's note to you on UN Security Council Reform. You are right that overall our best position for the
moment is
Have a good trip!

The plan is to have a large screen off to your side so that it won't get in the way of a tight shot. We've worked with
National Geographic on the photos -- some of which are quite stunning -- and they'll pace the presentation slowly with

Haiti recovery blueprint includes foreign donors
BY JACQUELINE CHARLES
jcharles@MiamiHerald.com
Call it the $100 million club.
That's the amount each donor nation will have to ante up for a say in Haiti's early recovery under a plan Haitian
President Rene Preval plans to present at an international donors conference in New York at month's end.
While Haitian and foreign disaster experts were tallying the cost to rebuild after the Jan. 12, 7.0-magnitude earthquake -
- $11.5 billion -- Preval and his advisors have been quietly negotiating the blueprint of the development plan that will
shape Haiti's reconstruction over the next decade.
"It moves it in the right direction," Mark Schneider, senior vice president of the Washington D.C.-based International
Crisis Group, said of the plan, which he has seen. "I've said, the first phase of reconstruction is a decade. The real test is
a generation and hopefully with partnerships both inside and outside of Haiti, it will continue for that time period."
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775183 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775183 Date: 08/31/2015
The plan includes creation of an Interim Haitian Recovery Commission that will -- for the first time -- seek to guide how
and where aid is spent by giving both Haitians and foreigners a vote in reconstruction priorities and projects over the
next 18 months. Haiti's president will retain veto power and there's a starring role for former U.S. President Bill Clinton if
he wants it.
The blueprint is certain to come under plenty of scrutiny in Haiti, a country plagued and in-fighting among donors. Over
the years, billions of dollars in aid -- often delivered after hurricanes or political coups -- has failed to produce any signs
of lasting progress in a country that remains the poorest in the Western Hemisphere.
Clinton, who is to visit Haiti Monday along with former President George W. Bush, will be asked to help lead Haiti's
reconstruction planning over the short-term as co-chair -- along with the Haitian prime minister -- of the commission,
several sources confirmed to The Miami Herald.
Clinton, who is already in charge of the international relief effort for the United Nations, has not said whether he'll
accept the job as Haiti's reconstruction czar but he has championed the strategy, saying the goal is to provide to Haitians
the success that has long eluded them.He and Bush are visiting Haiti, where more than 200,000 people were killed in the
quake, in their roles as co-chairs of the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund. The private U.S. fundraising effort, initiated by President
Obama, has raised more than $36 million.
The commission's goal will be to plan and coordinate reconstruction priorities and projects over the next 18 months with
recommendations from a 20-member board made up of Haitians and foreign donors. Eventually, the commission would
morph into the Haiti Development Authority (HDA), a central planning agency tasked with approving all reconstruction
projects in Haiti regardless of which country or aid agency is funding it.
The authority's executive director, like that of the commission, likely would be a well-respected Haitian.
"Haitians must have the chance to lead the rebuilding of Haiti," said U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's chief of staff
Cheryl Mills, a key person in talks. "Development authorities have helped other countries that have large donor
communities to accomplish their visions -- we want no less for Haiti and its citizens."
The original plan, first reported by The Herald last month, was modeled on the successful reconstruction authority
created in Indonesia after the 2004 tsunami and presented by Mills to Preval and top Haitian officials last month. Other
countries and multilateral institutions also presented plans to the Haitian government.
The U.S. plan has since undergone several revisions at Prevails urging.
Among them: offering a voting seat on the commission's board to each donor pledging $100 million or more over the
next two years and donors who provide $200 million in debt cancellation. As a result, Venezuela is among the likely
donors to help review and approve projects. Initially 16 members, the board was expanded to give a say-so to Haiti's
private sector and labor unions and the 15-nation sub-regional Caribbean Community (CARCIOM). The plan also
establishes a Multi-donor Trust Fund, administered by the World Bank, to possibly pool donors' dollars for
reconstruction projects.
For decades, Haiti has been plagued by a lack of planning and coordination among donor nations and aid groups as they
battled among each other in the poverty-stricken country.
Using the Indonesian model employed in Indonesia after the Asian tsunami, plan supporters say the reconstruction
commission offers Haiti the best chance to lead its own redevelopment and to change the way donors do business,
ending an era where aid groups spend budgets larger than Haitian ministries without any accountability to the Haitian
people. But that can only be achieved in Haiti, say supporters, if donors and their projects are coordinated, and in line
with Haiti's vision and post-disaster reconstruction needs, which will be presented at the March 31 New York conference

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775183 Date: 08/31/2015
and remains a work in progress while the government seeks input from various Haitian groups, including the Diaspora.
Also Haiti's parliament must vote on the creation of the Interim Haitian Recovery Commission.
Still, the idea of putting Haiti's reconstruction into the hands of one central authority -- or having some donors channel
their money into a trust fund -- is not without detractors. Some argue that the authority could render government
ministries obsolete because projects would now bypass them, while others point out that a similar World Bank fund in
the Sudan has been troubled by rules leaving schools and healthcare facilities undone as hundreds of millions of dollars
remain unspent.
Meanwhile, Haitian government officials worry that donors may not want to change the way they do business with Haiti,
rendering the reconstruction a failure before it gets started.
"The creation of the [trust fund] or the [Haiti Development Authority] are improvements to changing the paradigm if
and only if everybody plays the game -- putting most of their money in the fund -- and access to the funds is more
flexible than the usual process of disbursing from the international donors," Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive
told The Herald.
In the past, donors have pledged hundreds of millions of dollars to assist Haiti but have fallen short in disbursing those
dollars -- or at times spent the money on projects without consulting the Haitian government about whether the
projects were needed.
Last week, as representatives of the Haitian government and others met to prepare for the New York conference,
Bellerive warned that "New York could be a failure if we don't reach an agreement on the structure for the coordination
and the organization of the trust fund...(and) don't manage to establish together the priorities for immediate
investments," to begin reconstructing the country.

Dear Cheryl,
Thanks for your trademark prompt, clear and courteous response. As always, it and you are appreciated knowing the
demands of your responsibilities.
I fully realize that the Secretary is engaged (understatement of the year), so I will wait on and anticipate her call as soon
as she has a convenient window to do so. The matters I would like to discuss with Hillary are very timely and important
but not urgent.
I will be available on my cell phone or through my assistant who
will be traveling with me. Coordinates in London are as follows.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775265 Date: 08/31/2015
Dear Cheryl,
Good morning on a consequential and indeed historic week in the life of our country given the passage of health care
reform. President Obama was courageous, persevering and skilled in his leadership and efforts. Having said that, in my
humble opinion, he would not have been successful had it not been for President Clinton's, Hillary's and our efforts in
1994. That's my story and I'm sticking to it, and I believe it's true.
I know this has been a particularly demanding week in the life of the Secretary and in your life as well. Having
Netanyahu, AIPAC and a major trip to Mexico to fight the narco-traffickers is a formidable task even for Hillary Clinton.
Cheryl, I would like to respectfully request a brief meeting or phone call with Secretary Clinton following up on the
conversation she initiated with me at the Vital Voices event regarding the IDB. It's my sense and belief that this matter
needs to be carefully handled for a number of reasons including the longstanding friendship that both the Secretary and
President Clinton have with Luis Alberto Moreno. I also have another important and timely matter (personal not
business) that I would like to discuss with Hillary in our time together.
As I think you know, I try to be very judicious about these types of requests. I think 15 minutes either in person or by
phone will be adequate to cover both of these subjects. As always, I appreciate your consideration relating to my
request. Thank you and I'll await your guidance and direction.
Personally,
Mack

Robert,
Are you sure that the USA Pavilion would not be in a sponsorship by Wynn Resorts (specifically Wynn Macau)? There
CFO, Matt Maddox, has expressed strong interest.
The Wynn Macau well known brand in China and Steve Wynn is an extremely popular figure in China. In addition, he is
well respected and well though of by the Chinese leadership and business leaders. A sponsorship by Wynn would be
well received.
I should be able to get an answer by early next week, but don't want to look foolish if they would be rejected.

Not much of a surprise. Later this morning KBH will announce that she will NOT resign her Senate seat.

MEDIA NOTE
Joint Statement on the Upcoming Sudan National Elections
Following is the text of a joint statement by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas
Store, and United Kingdom Foreign Secretary David Miliband on the upcoming national elections in Sudan.
Begin Text:
National elections in Sudan this month will represent a major milestone in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement that
ended Sudan's twenty-two year civil war, and are an important opportunity for the people of Sudan to participate in the
political process.
We urge all parties in Sudan to work urgently to ensure that elections can proceed peacefully and credibly in April. We
are deeply concerned by reports of continued administrative and logistical challenges, as well as restrictions on political
freedoms. We call on the Government of Sudan, the National Elections Commission, and all political parties to engage in
further dialogue to resolve practical obstacles, procedural impediments, and address allegations of intimidation,
harassment, and safety concerns, and other legitimate concerns raised by various political parties. We continue to urge
the parties to improve conditions on the ground in Darfur and create a secure environment conducive to Darfuri
participation.
Irrespective of the outcome of elections, it is essential that work continues and is accelerated to meet remaining CPA
deadlines. Progress is needed urgently to complete border demarcation, to establish the commissions that will
supervise the referenda for the South and Abyei, to conduct popular consultations in Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan,
and to negotiate sustainable post-CPA arrangements in areas such as wealth-sharing, citizenship and assets, and
liabilities.
We reiterate our commitment to ensure that the referenda must happen on schedule and that their outcomes need to
be respected. It is time to redouble efforts to achieve these ends. We urge all parties in Sudan and all regional and
international partners to work together to achieve the peaceful future that the people of Sudan deserve.

US Foreign Policy: Waiting on a Sun King By Edward Luce and Daniel Dombey Financial Times
Published: March 30 2010
For better or for worse, Washington has grown used to the fact that Barack Obama runs the most centralised — or
"White House-centric" — administration since Richard Nixon. When Nixon wanted foreign policy advice, everyone knew
where he got it from: Henry Kissinger, variously his national security adviser and secretary of state.
In contrast, Mr Obama has no big foreign policy strategist. Even insiders give different answers when asked to whom he
turns for advice on the big international questions. But almost all agree with the following observation. "The truth is that
President Obama is his own Henry Kissinger — no one else plays that role," says a senior official. "Every administration
reflects the personality of the president. This president wants all the trains routed through the Oval Office."
Fifteen months after he took office, the character and structure of Mr Obama's foreign policy machinery is still evolving.
But from interviews with dozens of insiders and outsiders, including senior officials both authorised and unauthorised to
speak, and three former national security advisers, it is clear the buck not only stops with, but often floats for quite a
long time around, Mr Obama himself.
Foreigners have complained about the tendency of his domestic agenda to crowd out the international one — the
passage last week of healthcare reform was greeted with an audible sigh of relief among US allies. But within foreign
policy itself, his centralised structure can also result in many issues being left on the back burner awaiting presidential
attention, say critics.
"On the positive side, we have a very conscientious president who takes advice widely," says the official. "On the debit
side, for all the president's intelligence, Barack Obama came to office with very little experience. He just doesn't have
much depth on some issues."
The core of Mr Obama's foreign policy machinery is in the White House-based National Security Council, which advises
the president and co-ordinates activities across an increasingly complex alphabet soup of Washington departments,
military commands and intelligence agencies. The most widely questioned link in the chain is Jim Jones, whom, to many
people's surprise, Mr Obama brought in as his national security adviser.
Only briefly acquainted with Mr Obama beforehand, General Jones, a retired four-star marine corps general, shows little
interest in running the "inter-agency" process — a key part of the job. Somewhat unconventionally, Gen Jones travels

frequently and is thus often out of town. Unusually, it is Mr Obama himself who usually chairs the weekly National
Security Council, known as the "principals meeting", not Gen Jones.
Rahm Emanuel, Mr Obama's chief of staff, is also a key part of it. "If you were to ask me who the real national security
adviser is, I would say there were three or four, of whom Rahm is one and of which Gen Jones is probably the least
important," says another official.
Anyone who has dealt with Gen Jones speaks highly of his matter-of-factness, his geniality and the respect many foreign
governments have for him — Pakistan and Israel among them. But as he himself admitted rather disarmingly last year, he
does not have a taste for bureaucracy. Speaking at the Atlantic Council, a think-tank where he previously worked, Gen
Jones provoked laughter when he said: "I fondly remember [the Atlantic Council] as a place where people actually did
what you asked them to do. In my new role I'm finding out that an order is a basis for negotiation."
STATE AND DEFENCE DEPARTMENTS
An 'alliance of the unsackables' finds it can confront the inner circle
If there is a caveat to the depiction of the Obama administration as White House-centric, it is in the alliance between
Hillary Clinton and Robert Gates, the president's secretaries of state and defence.
Mrs Clinton has proved one of the surprises of Barack Obama's tenure, forging a strong working relationship with her
former rival and establishing herself as his chief foreign policy spokesperson internationally — if not at home, where Mr
Obama's inner circle often seems to monopolise the explaining.
Mr Gates, who recently decided to stay for at least another year, is seen as unsackable, not least for the credibility he
lends on issues ranging from missile defence to Guantanamo Bay and Afghanistan. As a holdover from the Bush
administration, his national security bona fides are hard to dispute. It is no coincidence that Mrs Clinton is probably the
only other unsackable cabinet member.
The combination has made itself felt in some of the administration's most significant debates, notably on Afghanistan,
where both successfully urged the deployment of more troops."
Gates and Clinton happen to like each other, which no one really predicted," says one official, who notes that while the
traditional role of the NSC is to "play referee" between the state and defence departments, it is as often nowadays a
combination of the two against the White House. This is very different from how it worked when Donald Rumsfeld and
Colin Powell held those positions."We work together well," Mr Gates said at an appearance with Mrs Clinton on CNN
last year. "I think it starts with, frankly, based on my experience, the secretary of defence being willing to acknowledge
that the secretary of state is the principal spokesperson for United States foreign policy."
Their outlooks often overlap. From the Pentagon, Mr Gates has long called for more US spending on diplomacy. As chief
diplomat, Mrs Clinton has adopted a muscular approach. On Iran, both favour tough sanctions; on Russia, both have
sought to reassure Moscow's neighbours even while improving relations with the Kremlin.
But for all their workmanlike co-operation, there is no escaping the fact that Mrs Clinton is not part of the Obama inner
circle — a traditionally helpful feature in that job. There is also a constant "residue of friction" between Mr Obama's and
Mrs Clinton's teams, according to insiders. For example, Cheryl Mills, Mrs Clinton's chief of staff, has had several run-ins
with others in the administration.
One official describes Mrs Clinton as "totally loyal" to Mr Obama. He adds: "She and the president are not the best of
friends — how could they be? But she totally respects the presidency — she was married to a president and she wanted to
be one... She still might be."

The lack of a strong national security adviser has created recurring difficulties. Perhaps the best example is the Arab-
Israeli peace process, which Mr Obama launched on his second day in office when he appointed George Mitchell as his
envoy. Three months later, Mr Obama insisted Benjamin Netanyahu freeze all settlements activity in order to boost Arab
confidence in the talks.
In a heated showdown in the Oval Office last May, in which Mr Netanyahu refused to accede to Mr Obama's demand,
the only officials present were Mr Emanuel and David Axelrod, senior adviser to Mr Obama in office and during the
campaign. Gen Jones was not there. The fallout put the talks in abeyance and damped high Arab hopes for Mr Obama.
"The question is, which bright spark advised the president to demand a settlements freeze without working out what
the next step should be when Netanyahu inevitably said 'No'?" says Leslie Gelb, an official in the Carter administration
and former head of the Council on Foreign Relations. "Why wasn't George Mitchell in the room? Where was Jones?"Mr
Obama's character is also stamped on the inter-agency process, set up and managed by Tom Donilon, deputy national
security adviser. The nitty-gritty of foreign policy-making is done at these frequent "deputies' meetings", which can
sometimes consume four to six hours a day.
Described by one insider as "the most powerful man in the White House whose name isn't widely known", Mr Donilon,
who was an official in the Clinton administration, is the man who keeps Mr Obama's trains running on time. And there
are a lot of trains. Last year, Mr Donilon held 270 deputies meetings — a workload described as "clinically insane" by a
former senior diplomat under Bill Clinton.
But as time goes on, it is becoming streamlined — now taking up roughly two to three hours a day, say officials. "People
forget that we inherited two wars, terrorism threats, and perhaps the biggest single eight-year decline [George
W. Bush's two terms] in America's power and reputation in our history," says a senior official. "It took time to put in
place a process that could deal with the very complex decisions we had to take."
Also the organiser of Mr Obama's 9.30am national security briefing, Mr Donilon reinstated the paper trails needed to
prevent intra-governmental anarchy, using the model de-vised by Brent Scowcroft, national se-curity adviser to George
Bush senior and Gerald Ford. Vice-president Joe Biden's team was also incorporated to prevent the kind of "parallel
process" Dick Cheney used to circumvent the bureaucracy under George W. Bush.
"If you look for the 2002 or 2003 meeting where the decision to go to war in Iraq was taken, you cannot find it," says the
senior official. "By getting the process right, we are improving the quality of decisions."
The deputies' ties go back years. For example, the families of Mr Donilon and Jim Steinberg, deputy secretary of state,
often go on holiday together. Mr Donilon's wife, Cathy Russell, is chief of staff to Jill Biden, the vice-president's wife. Mr
Steinberg's wife, Sherburne Abbott, is deputy to John Holdren, Mr Obama's chief scientific adviser.
All those who regularly attend, including Michele Flournoy, a senior Pentagon official, and Susan Rice, the US
ambassador to the United Nations, have known each other since at least 1993, when they started off in the Clinton
administration. This is just as well, since they spend half their lives together:
"A lot of work gets done in that group," says Ms Flournoy. "Sometimes it feels like shovelling coal to keep the fires
going."
The refurbished machinery was perhaps most in evidence during the build-up to Mr Obama's decision in December to
send another 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan — a journey that took four months and involved him in 40 hours of Oval
Office meetings.
But the very diligence of the process crowded out Mr Obama's time to focus on other crises — of which there are many.
"Time is the most precious commodity a president has," says a for-mer national security ad-viser.
"On average he is only going to have 45 minutes a day for foreign policy, so you want to make sure it is well spent."

The widely expected departure of Gen Jones before the end of the year has also created rivalries within the engine
room. Those who are thought to have ambitions to replace him include Mr Steinberg, Ms Rice, Mr Donilon and Denis
McDonough, NSC chief of staff and the foreign policy official who is personally closest to Mr Obama. Although all are
widely respected, none is considered a big strategic thinker in the Kissinger or Scowcroft mould.
Described by Mr Gelb as Mr Obama's "Lord High Executioner", Mr McDonough "has appended himself to the Chicago
crowd", says another official. Mr McDonough's widely feared role highlights some of the contradictions of Mr Obama's
foreign policy apparatus.
Once an adviser to former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, Mr McDonough was frequently at Mr Obama's side
during the campaign. Insiders describe him as the "en-forcer" and as the keeper of "message discipline", a key element
of any campaign but something that can drastically slow the wheels of government.
"McDonough is the guy from the campaign and the one who plays basketball with the president — they're very close,"
says an official. "Instead of Jim Jones telling McDonough what the president thinks, it is the other way round."
Indeed, if Mr Obama's highly centralised foreign policy machine had a face, it would be Mr McDonough's. "Donilon has
been perceived to make the process inclusive and give everyone a seat at the table," says David Rothkopf, a former
Clinton official and scholar on the NSC. "Fairly or not, McDonough has been perceived as representing a process that
was taking place in another room, among the inner circle, at a table to which most weren't invited."Mr Obama has built
a machine in which all roads lead to and from him. On the minus side, that means a lot of lower-level meetings without
decisions. It also means neglecting issues that cannot be squeezed into his diary, such as trade policy, which continues to
drift; or relations with India, which are unnecessarily tense.
And it means that the fingerprints of Mr Obama's political inner circle are detected by the rumour mill even when they
are absent, such as on the president's decision to begin the troop withdrawal from Afghanistan in July 2011 — a
recommendation that came from Robert Gates, secretary of defence.
On the plus side, Mr Obama has a sharp learning curve, which means his administration continues to evolve. On the plus
side also, if it has to be White House-centric, it is perhaps better with him as the Sun King than, say, Nixon or George W.
Bush."At the end of each meeting, the president summarises what everyone has said and the arguments each has made
with a real lawyer's clarity," says a participant to the NSC principals meeting, which includes Mr Gates and Mrs Clinton.
"When the president finally makes a decision, it is with the full facts and usually shows a high calibre of judgment."
When Mr Obama makes a decision, that is.

Ms Flournoy. "Sometimes it feels like shovelling coal to keep the fires going."
The refurbished machinery was perhaps most in evidence during the build-up to Mr Obama's decision in December to
send another 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan — a journey that took four months and involved him in 40 hours of Oval
Office meetings.
But the very diligence of the process crowded out Mr Obama's time to focus on other crises — of which there are many.
"Time is the most precious commodity a president has," says a for-mer national security ad-viser. "On average he is only
going to have 45 minutes a day for foreign policy, so you want to make sure it is well spent."
The widely expected departure of Gen Jones before the end of the year has also created rivalries within the engine
room. Those who are thought to have ambitions to replace him include Mr Steinberg, Ms Rice, Mr Donilon and Denis
McDonough, NSC chief of staff and the foreign policy official who is personally closest to Mr Obama. Although all are
widely respected, none is considered a big strategic thinker in the Kissinger or Scowcroft mould.
Described by Mr Gelb as Mr Obama's "Lord High Executioner", Mr McDonough "has appended himself to the Chicago
crowd", says another official. Mr McDonough's widely feared role highlights some of the contradictions of Mr Obama's
foreign policy apparatus.
Once an adviser to former Senate majority leader Torn Daschle, Mr McDonough was frequently at Mr Obama's side
during the campaign. Insiders describe him as the "en-forcer" and as the keeper of "message discipline", a key element
of any campaign but something that can drastically slow the wheels of government.
"McDonough is the guy from the campaign and the one who plays basketball with the president — they're very close,"
says an official. "Instead of Jim Jones telling McDonough what the president thinks, it is the other way round."
Indeed, if Mr Obama's highly centralised foreign policy machine had a face, it would be Mr McDonough's. "Donilon has
been perceived to make the process inclusive and give everyone a seat at the table," says David Rothkopf, a former
Clinton official and scholar on the NSC. "Fairly or not, McDonough has been perceived as representing a process that
was taking place in another room, among the inner circle, at a table to which most weren't invited."
Mr Obama has built a machine in which all roads lead to and from him. On the minus side, that means a lot of lower-
level meetings without decisions. It also means neglecting issues that cannot be squeezed into his diary, such as trade
policy, which continues to drift; or relations with India, which are unnecessarily tense.
And it means that the fingerprints of Mr Obama's political inner circle are detected by the rumour mill even when they
are absent, such as on the president's decision to begin the troop withdrawal from Afghanistan
<http://www.ft.com/cms/s/c4efd1d6-df74-11de-98ca-00144feab49a.html> in July 2011 — a recommendation that came
from Robert Gates, secretary of defence.
On the plus side, Mr Obama has a sharp learning curve, which means his administration continues to evolve. On the plus
side also, if it has to be White House-centric, it is perhaps better with him as the Sun King than, say, Nixon or George W.
Bush.
"At the end of each meeting, the president summarises what everyone has said and the arguments each has made with
a real lawyer's clarity," says a participant to the NSC principals meeting, which includes Mr Gates and Mrs Clinton.
"When the president finally makes a decision, it is with the full facts and usually shows a high calibre of judgment."
When Mr Obama makes a decision, that is.

STATE AND DEFENCE DEPARTMENTS
An 'alliance of the unsackables' finds it can confront the inner circle
If there is a caveat to the depiction of the Obama administration as White House-centric, it is in the alliance
between Hillary Clinton and Robert Gates, the president's secretaries of state and defence.
Mrs Clinton has proved one of the surprises of Barack Obama's tenure, forging a strong working relationship with
her former rival and establishing herself as his chief foreign policy spokesperson internationally — if not at home, where
Mr Obama's inner circle often seems to monopolise the explaining.
Mr Gates, who recently decided to stay for at least another year, is seen as unsackable, not least for the credibility
he lends on issues ranging from missile defence to Guantanamo Bay and Afghanistan. As a holdover from the Bush
administration, his national security bona fides are hard to dispute. It is no coincidence that Mrs Clinton is probably the
only other unsackable cabinet member.
The combination has made itself felt in some of the administration's most significant debates, notably on
Afghanistan, where both successfully urged the deployment of more troops.
"Gates and Clinton happen to like each other, which no one really predicted," says one official, who notes that while
the traditional role of the NSC is to "play referee" between the state and defence departments, it is as often nowadays a
combination of the two against the White House. This is very different from how it worked when Donald Rumsfeld and
Colin Powell held those positions.
"We work together well," Mr Gates said at an appearance with Mrs Clinton on CNN last year. "I think it starts with,
frankly, based on my experience, the secretary of defence being willing to acknowledge that the secretary of state is the
principal spokesperson for United States foreign policy."
Their outlooks often overlap. From the Pentagon, Mr Gates has long called for more US spending on diplomacy. As
chief diplomat, Mrs Clinton has adopted a muscular approach. On !ran, both favour tough sanctions; on Russia, both
have sought to reassure Moscow's neighbours even while improving relations with the Kremlin.
But for all their workmanlike co-operation. there is no escaping the fact that Mrs Clinton is not part of the Obama
inner circle — a traditionally helpful feature in that job. There is also a constant "residue of friction" between Mr
Obama's and Mrs Clinton's teams, according to insiders. For example, Cheryl Mills, Mrs Clinton's chief of staff, has had
several run-ins with others in the administration.
One official describes Mrs Clinton as "totally loyal" to Mr Obama. He adds: "She and the president are not the best
of friends — how could they be? But she totally respects the presidency— she was married to a president and she wanted
to be one ... She still might be."

Preval rejects US advice on presidential election
By JONATHAN M. KATZ (AP) — 2 hours ago
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Haiti's president on Wednesday rejected U.S. Senate recommendations on holding an election
for his successor, brushing off criticism that the current process will leave the shattered country without a credible
leader.
A report issued this month by Sen. Richard Lugar, the ranking Republican on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, "strongly encourages" Haiti to let its international partners help restructure the eight-member Provisional
Electoral Council, which has been accused of corruption.
The report also recommends ensuring the participation of the key opposition party of ousted former President Jean-
Bertrand Aristide, which was blocked from participating in 2009 legislative contests because of a dispute over rival
candidate lists.
On Tuesday, President Rene Preval fulfilled one recommendation of the report by issuing a signed decree setting
election day for Nov. 28.
But speaking at a news conference in an open-air gazebo alongside the broken remains of the national palace a day
later, Preval told reporters he had no intention of complying with the rest, including changing the election body, known
as the CEP.
"I'm not doing the CEP with international partners. I'm doing the CEP with national partners," Preval said. "The senator's
proposition is inadmissible."
Seeking to show the council was not "hand-picked," as he said in English, Preval handed out copies of nomination letters
for the panel's members submitted by various national and religious organizations, including the National Council of
Political Parties, Roman Catholic Church and National Confederation of Haitian Vodou.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775309 Date: 08/31/2015
He also defended the prohibition on the exiled Aristide's Fanmi Lavalas party in last year's elections, a ban that came
after rival factions of the party submitted competing lists of candidates.
"International donors need to look for an accord with the CEP and the political parties and the factions of Fanmi
Lavalas," Preval said. "We are giving (the parties) the support that they need, and the factions need to figure it out (for
themselves)."
Preval did not discuss the forced resignation of an electoral council member accused of stealing a staffer's pay or
opponents' allegations that the council gave special privileges to the president's newly formed Unity Party ahead of
planned Feb. 28 legislative elections, which were postponed because of the Jan. 12 earthquake that devastated the
capital.
He also declined to answer questions about another U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee report that criticizes
Haiti's earthquake recovery, saying he would address that issue at a news conference on reconstruction next week.
Elections have never been easy in Haiti, a country whose founding president crowned himself emperor. It took 186 years
to hold what the international community considered a democratic election in 1990, which was then closely followed by
a coup d'etat.
Preval, in fact, is the only Haitian ever to be elected president, serve a full term and hand off power to an elected
successor. Unable to run for re-election in the November contest, he pledged to relinquish power again as he did in the
1990s — after protesters alleged earlier this year that he was dragging his feet on holding presidential the election.
Doing so will require significant help. The electoral council's headquarters were destroyed and its records lost in the
quake, while millions of voters were either killed, made homeless or displaced. Its new headquarters is a former Gold's
Gym seized by drug agents.
The election will also be a cost burden for this grindingly poor Caribbean nation: $29 million according to electoral
officials at the news conference with Preval, $38 million according to the U.S. Senate report.
The Organization of American States and United Nations have pledged support. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon
issued a statement Wednesday praising the decree setting the election date and pledged the help of U.N. peacekeepers
and advisers in preparing and supporting the ballot. Ban urged member states to quickly provide the money needed to
run the vote.

Do they honestly think that publicizing a quote like this, on record or off, works to their advantage?
Israeli diplomatic [euphemism for Prime Minister's Office -- DR] sources said: "Clinton isn't relevant and is out of
the circle of influence. Mitchell has taken over the peace process to a great extent and Obama, in any event, is the
important person in this story because he is the one who decides."

Netanyahu is to leave next week for Washington, where he will meet with US President Barack Obama. Rather curiously,
he is not scheduled to meet with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the course of his visit to Washington.
Contrary to his previous visit in March, this time the US administration intends to create the impression,
outwardly at least, that the severe crisis in the relationship has passed and that the relations between the two countries
are as strong as ever. In order to bolster that impression, the two leaders will meet the media together and will be
photographed. As opposed to the previous time, Netanyahu will also be put up at Blair House, the official White House
guesthouse, and not at a hotel.
That said, officials in Washington are waiting apprehensively for the answers that Netanyahu will provide in the
course of the meeting, which is expected to address the transition from the proximity talks that are at an impasse to
direct negotiations. Obama, apparently, will demand that Netanyahu agree to extend the construction freeze in Judea
and Samaria beyond the September 26 expiration date in hope of securing PA Chairman Abu Mazen's consent to begin
direct talks with Israel. For the time being, the forum of seven is divided over this issue.

3 bombs devastated the shrine of Data Ganjbakhsh (the most sacred Muslim place in all of South Asia, and the shrine S
was supposed to go to). Aside from loss of life, this is a major blow to Pakistan. I recommend that you call Qureshi,
Nawaz and Pasha (who will be here tomorrow). This will either break Pakistanis or will get them into the fight. This

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON
Bombing of the Shrine of Syed Ali Hujviri in Lahore
I was shocked and saddened by yesterday's attack on one of Pakistan's most popular places of worship, the Shrine of
Syed Ali Hujviri (Data Ganjbakhsh) in Lahore, which claimed the lives of many innocent Pakistanis.
The extremists have shown that they respect neither human dignity nor the fundamental religious values of Pakistani
society. Violating the sanctity of this revered shrine is a particularly sinister attempt to destabilize Pakistan and to
intimidate its people. The attackers will not succeed, as the Pakistani public refuses to be cowed by such violence.
We condemn this brutal crime and reaffirm our commitment to support the Pakistani people in their efforts to defend
their democracy from the violent extremists who seek to destroy it. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of
the victims and with all the people of Pakistan.

On UK: Clegg held his own in the second debate last night. Gordon hit him as "anti-American." This feels like it's moving
to a hung parliament. Cameron can't break through. Two-thirds of the voters simply hate the Tories. No matter how well
Clegg does the system doesn't allow for any gain in seats to match his personal poll numbers. UK stunned by its first

At behest of PDT, I tried to call you just minutes ago to ask about your availability for phone call from him this afternoon.
- First choice: 5:00 p.m. (your time)
- Alternative: 7:00 p.m.
- If neither works for you, then propose time and we'll accomodate.
Two options to suggest:
1.With our individual cell phones, it is difficult to involve third person - to wit, me. Could you arrange for a conference
type number and code to which PD and I could call separately? 1 .4(B)
2.Or as alternative, do you have capacity to call us separately to turn it into a conference call?
1 .4(D)
Either option would not only make for a smoother conversation, but would also allow me to not have to be in same Bi
location as PDT.
so best that call be today.

CDM:
At behest of PDT, I tried to call you just minutes ago to ask about your availability for phone call from him this afternoon.
- First choice: 5:00 p.m. (your time)
- Alternative: 7:00 p.m.
- If neither works for you, then propose time and we'll accomodate.
Two options to suggest:
1.With our individual cell phones, it is difficult to involve third person - to wit, me. Could you arrange for a conference
type number and code to which PD and I could call separately?
2. Or as alternative, do you have capacity to call us separately to turn it into a conference call? 1.4(B)
Either option would not only make for a smoother conversation, but would also allow me to not have to be in same1.4(D)
location as PDT.
so best that call be today.

In light of Clegg's rising popularity partly based on his anti-Americanism and Germany's growing hegemony in Europe
while becoming more insular, John Kornblum has written this op-ed with reference in last graphs to US policy.

Germany in Need of a Dream
By JOHN KORNBLUM
Has Germany abandoned Europe? Do Angela Merkel's tough conditions for aid to Greece mean that Germany is no
longer the motor of European integration? Has Frau Merkel in fact morphed from the Miss Europa of 2007 to the
Fraulein Germania of 2010, as Germany's own former foreign minister Joschka Fischer has suggested?
As a former American ambassador who has lived and worked the better part of four decades around Germany, my
Blackberry often glows red hot with messages from persons asking these questions. My response is always the same:
Germany has changed very little, but Europe and the world have changed a lot. Therein lies the dilemma.
Germany has worked hard to dig its way out of the disaster of 1945, but trauma remains a defining issue for German
society. Sixty five years later, Germany is still focused on the three essentials of its recovery: stability, respectability and
peace. Keep this triangle in mind and lots of things quickly come into focus.
From the first days of the Federal Republic, Germany's leaders emphasized the importance of defining interests solely
within a common European and Atlantic vocation. But they also understood that renouncing national ambitions did not
remove the responsibility to pursue specific German goals through the common institutions.
Many important postwar accomplishments were conceived and pushed by Germany, sometimes over the opposition of
others — including the United States. Ostpolitik was controversial for years, as was NATO enlargement. Germany
pushed them with determination.

Helmut Kohl did not consult before promulgating his 10 points on reunification. He agreed to French desires for a
common currency, but only if it could be a mirror of the Deutsche mark, for decades the European monetary standard.
The euro stability pact, now the object of so much controversy with Greece, was the result. After 1990, the E.U.'s
eastward expansion was Germany's way of firming up its Eastern flank.
Slowly and without fanfare, Germany has been remaking the European Union in its image. At each step of the way,
Germany made its wishes more palatable by paying more than its share. Part of today's misunderstanding is caused by
Germany's success in using its contributions to build an image of selflessness. Germany has been as single-minded in
pursuit of its goals as Charles de Gaulle ever was for his, but it almost always left leadership to others.
A new consciousness grew after the costs of reunification began to mount. "Europe" in the institutional sense has
become increasingly unpopular. German courts have begun to define German European issues in the context of the
German Constitution rather than on the basis of E.U. law. At least some of Ms. Merkel's refusal to allow immediate
assistance to Greece was based on her fears that it would fan anti-E.U. sentiment at home. Are these the first signs of a
German Tea Party?
Here we find the source of most of the hand wringing about Germany's role as the "motor of Europe." Ms. Merkel's
unwillingness to sweeten the financial pot echoed throughout Brussels. To many, it signified the decline of German
willingness to "salute the French flag three times before raising the German flag," as Konrad Adenauer used to put it.
Germans are not alone in objecting to throwing more money into the E.U. pot, but they happen to be the only ones who
can do something about it. Many fear that without German complaisance, the E.U. will stutter to a stop. But such self-
denial could never offer a viable foundation for a new Europe. Neither could the inefficiency and even corruption that
characterizes many E.U. programs.
Most maddening for most thinking Europeans is the knowledge that the Germans are right. But to them, the question is
whether Germany is remaking the E.U. in a fashion palatable to the majority of other member states. They are not so
sure that its focus on stability and accountability is the right way to help such a diverse collection of peoples adjust to a
globalized world.
And so when Angela Merkel raps Greek knuckles, she is sending a message most Europeans don't want to hear. Not that
Germany is dangerous; even worse, that it is unrelenting. The Neue Zuricher Zeitung probably spoke for many others
when it once accused Germany of wanting Europe to become a large Switzerland.
The growing gap between Germany's aspirations and the perceived needs of other members of the E.U. is beginning to
burden both sides. Most Europeans are simply not ready to live up to German standards. Without a more flexible sense
of common purpose, the project to build a democratic Europe could stop dead in the water. But as Germans will
themselves often tell you: They have forgotten how to dream.
Younger Germans feel this lack of inspiration as well. Dreams were what 200,000 of them were waiting to hear when
they rallied to hear Barack Obama in Berlin two summers ago. They wanted more than to "Dare to Hope," which is the
characteristically timid German translation of the title of the president's best seller. And they are still waiting. America
seems busy elsewhere.
The main conclusion I draw from the debate about Germany is that it is not about Germany at all. The task of building a
democratic Europe is far from complete. Most of the foundations have been laid and now the residents are starting to
haggle over the design. Weaving today's 27 states into a true trans-Atlantic partnership is a task that is too big for
Germany or even Europe to accomplish alone. They desperately need some skilled architectural assistance.
Uniting Europe and North America is the most audacious project ever conceived. If it works, the United States will be
joined by nearly 500 million Europeans to form a democratic space, within which modern democratic values will harness
more energy than in any single nation on earth. Democracy's future as the operating system for a globalized world will
be assured.
European fecklessness seems to worry Washington officials these days. But if Germany has forgotten how to dream and
the United States is too busy to try, we will both be guilty of perpetuating the aimlessness we so criticize. To hold up its
side of the bargain, Europe needs exactly what Barack Obama originally promised — the audacity of hope.
John Kornblum, senior counselor with the international law firm Noerr LLP in Berlin, served as the U.S. ambassador to
Germany from 1997 to 2001.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775537 Date: 08/31/2015
Key events:
Dinner with Al Jazeera (AJ) staff: Al Director General Wadah Khanfar will host a dinner on May 1 with senior Al staff,
including AJ English Managing Director Tony Burman. We expect 7 people on the Al side and 6 on ours. (The dinner is
schedule for 8pm in a private room in the Four Seasons; post is making reservations for the party to stay in the same
hotel.)
Meeting with AJ Board Members at Al Headquarters: This will give you an opportunity to engage the Qatari leadership
of the network. Discussions topics should include the mid-May Washington visit by some AJ Board representatives. We
expect Wadah Khanfar to also participate in this meeting.
(TBC) Meeting with Prime Minister Hamad bin Jasim bin Jabir al-Thani (H131): As PM, HBJ is the ultimate Qatari authority
on Al. The meeting will also allow you to raise bi-lateral engagement issues as necessary. We expect to know in a few
days if HBJ will be available.
Meetings with CENTCOM: You will meet with CENTCOM staff at Al Udeid airbase just outside of Doha. The will brief
you on their within their AOR, but with particular focus on activities in
B1
1.4(D)
MEDIA:
Feature on Al Arabic: 15 minute "feature" piece filmed at Al Studios on the Administration's commitment to
engagement with Muslim communities worldwide. This will be a good opportunity to highlight the Entrepreneurship
Summit. We can expect you to also get questions on PD programs in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. You will be
interviewed by one of Al's "top" journalists; exactly who is still to be determined. The interview will be in English with
simultaneous interpretation into Arabic. It will likely air a number of times on AJ.
Feature on AJ English: This would be a second 15 minute "feature" piece similar to the one for AJ Arabic. If we are
pressed for time we can consider just doing the Al Arabic feature.
Roundtable with local Qatari media: This will include journalists from a number of local Qatari media outlets. This is
another opportunity to talk about the Administration's commitment to engagement, but with a more targeted focus on
bilateral engagement and exchange programs.

Subject: Brief memo for Cheryl Mills on Colombia - for Secretary Clinton
Dear Cheryl —
In my last email (Friday, 5/28), I attached the letter from the bipartisan Co-Chairs and Executive Committee members of
the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission sent to Assistant Secretary Mike Posner expressing grave concern about the
recent rise in death threats, attacks and murders of Colombian human rights defenders, religious, community and other
NGO leaders. Congressman McGovern also strongly encouraged the Secretary to meet with representatives of those
organizations and individuals being threatened, with a particularly effort to reach out to and invite the Bishops of
Tumaco (Narifio), Barrancabermeja/Medio Magdalena (Santander), and we would now add Putumayo, since the
Colombian Catholic Church just advised us yesterday of increased death threats against religious workers there. In
addition, we recommended inviting Monserior Hector Fabio Henao, director of Pastoral Social, at the Archdiocese in
Bogota, who represents all the pastoral work of the Church throughout the country, as well as representatives from the
Mennonite and Lutheran churches, in particular.
While in Colombia, the most important thing the Secretary can do is avoid effusive praise for President Alvaro Uribe,
who leaves office in August. Inside Colombia, the visit by the Secretary is being described as focusing solely on the free
trade agreement and continuing support of the counterdrug strategy/Plan Colombia. Without changes in the human
rights situation and the culture of impunity, it is unlikely that anything the Secretary might say or do will alter the
equation on Capitol Hill regarding the trade agreement. It should be noted that the October 2008 GAO report on the
counter-drug operations in Colombia concluded that U.S. assistance was successful in increasing security in parts of the
country, but a failure in the areas of counter-narcotics (GAO-09-71) , and a subsequent April 2009 USAID evaluation on
U.S. aid for Plan Colombia for illegal crop reduction and Colombian counternarcotics policies actually contribute to
increased coca production.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775576 Date: 08/31/2015
The Colombian president has been a solid backer of U.S. policy and U.S. interests in the region, and has achieved some
important improvements in the country's security situation. It is important to recognize that, but to do so without
repeating the tone of Defense Secretary Gates' April visit, in which he called Uribe a "great hero"
<http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=58754> and failed even to mention any concerns.
These concerns are of critical importance, and while the Secretary need not list them all, at least some deserve public
acknowledgement — some recognition that it is important to the United States that Colombia, including the current
government and its successor, show the necessary political will to deal with them:
A sharp rise in alleged military killings of civilians. In many cases, these are so-called "false positives": non-
combatants murdered and later presented as members of armed groups killed in combat. These, notes
<http://www.extrajudicialexecutions.org/colombia> UN Special Rapporter for Extrajudicial Executions Philip Alston,
"began occurring with a disturbing frequency across Colombia from 2004." Citing prosecutors' and NGOs' reports, Alston
indicates that Colombia's security forces may have killed 1,486 civilians during the first six years of Alvaro Uribe's
presidency. Alston notes that the Defense Ministry only began to address the situation after the media broke the story
of the false-positives and the subsequent negative publicity and horrified public outcry.
The prosecution of "false positives" is moving with excruciating slowness. In perhaps the most notorious case — the
murders of about twenty young men from the poor Bogota suburb of Soacha — nearly all of the accused soldiers and
officers have been released from prison <http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=49968>, pending trial, as
deadlines for timely prosecution have run out. Since their arrest in late 2008, their case has been prolonged by
numerous delaying tactics by the defense, including attempts to have their cases tried in the military court system as
"acts of service." Alston reports that the impunity rate on these extrajudicial murders by security forces may be as high
as 98.5 percent.
Mounting allegations that the President's intelligence service, the DAS, was put at the service
<http://www.cipcol.org/?p=1123> of paramilitary leaders and narcotraffickers; used to spy on and intimidate
<http://www.cipcol.org/?p=752> Supreme Court justices, opposition politicians, journalists and human rights
defenders; and employed in a campaign of sabotage and smears <http://www.cipcol.or.g/?p=1467> against political
opponents.
Prosecutors are alleging that the orders to have the DAS carry out wiretaps, surveillance and "political warfare" came
from high up in the Colombian presidency <http://www.caracoltv.com/noticias/justicia/articulo168592-tres-asesores-
de-uribe-son-investigados-chuzadas-ilegales> , though the question of "what President Uribe knew, and when he knew
it" remains unanswered. Meanwhile efforts to reform or dissolve the DAS are stalled in Colombia's Congress.
President Uribe's political coalition has also been hit by a scandal known in Colombia as "para-politics." This
•
coalition has included dozens of political bosses from regions beyond the capital. Many are large landholders with ties to
narcotrafficking, the same local leaders who created and fostered the brutal pro-government paramilitary groups that
killed tens of thousands of non-combatants in the 1990s and early 2000s.
Evidence, much of it from former paramilitary leaders, has brought about 300 criminal investigations against legislators,
governors, mayors and other local officials, nearly all of them Alvaro Uribe's political supporters, who made common
cause with the far-right warlords. To date, of the 278 congresspeople and senators elected in 2006, 68
<http://www.nuevoarcoiris.org.co/sac/?q=node/64> are under official investigation, on trial, or convicted for
paramilitary ties. Those embroiled in parapolitics include the President's cousin, Mario Uribe; the brother of his former
foreign minister; and individuals whom the President had named to be Colombia's ambassadors to Chile, the Dominican
Republic, and Canada.
The Colombian prosecutors, investigators, witnesses and non-governmental organizations trying to uncover the truth
about these abuses are working under conditions of great personal risk. They, too, are heroes and would benefit greatly

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775576 Date: 08/31/2015
from a public expression of concern about the cases they are investigating, and a reminder that their work is legitimate
and important to U.S. interests in Colombia.
At the same time, it is important to avoid appearing to endorse any candidate in the June 20 runoff elections. Between
the first and second rounds of a country's presidential election is a politically awkward time for a high-level official visit.
Though President Uribe's former defense minister, Juan Manuel Santos, is the overwhelming favorite given his margin of
success in the May 30th first round of balloting over former Bogota mayor Antanas Mockus, it is necessary at this stage
to convey a sense of balance and a willingness to work closely with whoever wins. As a result, any kind words for one
candidate should be balanced by praise for the other.
Finally, it would be helpful to remind the Colombian people that the United States supports a peaceful resolution of
Bogota's worsening differences with Venezuela. While President Chavez's behavior is a significant concern, it would be
most unhelpful to be perceived on this trip as fanning the flames of conflict with Colombia — or playing into the Chavez
rhetoric that the U.S. and Colombia have military aspirations in the region.
Hope this memo, along with last week's copy of the TLHRC letter to Assistant Secretary Posner, are helpful and useful
materials for the Secretary as she plans her trip.
Very best wishes —
On behalf of Cong. Jim McGovern

BEIJING, April 29 (Reuters) - A knife-wielding man injured 28 children, two teachers and a security guard in a
kindergarten in eastern China, state media reported on Thursday, the fourth such stabbing case in recent weeks. Xu
Yuyuan, 47, an unemployed local man, broke into a classroom in Taixing city of eastern Jiangsu province on Thursday
morning, attacking the children with a 20 cm long knife, the official Xinhua news agency said. The injured children were
all about four years old, and five are in critical condition, it added. Xu has been jobless since he was fired from a local
insurance company in 2001, and then took part in pyramid selling schemes, Xinhua added. The attack is the fourth
reported school stabbing in China in recent weeks, and the rash of violence has prompted public calls for more measures
to protect students in a country where many couples only have one child. A man stabbed 16 students and a teacher at a
primary school in southern China on Wednesday, the same day that a former doctor was executed for stabbing to death
eight school children last month. "More concrete measures should be taken to make school the safest place," a
commentary in today's Beijing News said, calling for more serve punishment for these killers. Some Chinese people have
taken to the Internet to discuss the root causes of the increasing number of school tragedies

(AP) Updated at 1:29 p.m. ET
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin played the eco-warrior in Russia's Arctic on Thursday, helping scientists track endangered
polar bears and calling for a cleanup of the region.
Putin traveled to Franz Josef Land, an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean off the northwest coast of Russia's mainland in his
latest display of adventuring prowess to highlight the country's guardianship of the resource-rich region.

Wearing a bright red coat and cap, the 57-year-old premier kneeled at the head of a tranquilized polar bear to attach a
satellite-tracking collar, then helped elevate the beast for weighing. The images were broadcast nationally.
Putin helped measure the bear and roll it onto its side.
On his departure, he shook its paw and uttered the words: "Be well."
"The paw is heavy. This is the master of the Arctic, you can feel that straight away," Putin said.
Of a total 25,000 polar bears remaining in the wild, about 6,000 are in Russia's Arctic territory, Russian news agencies
quoted officials as saying.
Putin also called for "a general cleanup of the Arctic," ordering the removal of thousands of barrels of fuel buried in the
snow that had been left unused by a Soviet-era military base.
He has been spearheading Russia's re-emergence as a regional power, including the country's claims over the Arctic's
formidable natural resources. Some 90 billion barrels of oil and one-third of the world's undiscovered natural gas lie
hidden in the Arctic region, the U.S. Geological Survey estimates.
"Geopolitically, Russia's deepest interests are linked to the Arctic," Putin said. "Here Russia's security and defense
capabilities is provided for. Here there are vitally important transport communications."
Canada, the U.S., Russia and Denmark have competing claims before a United Nations commission regarding extend
their undersea boundaries into areas previously blocked by Arctic ice.
Moscow dramatically staked its claim to the region by dropping a flag on the ocean floor at the North Pole in 2007.
Since then, all four countries have agreed to cool their rhetoric and allow scientists to finish their surveys.
Putin adores the media spotlight when it accentuates his macho side. He has been photographed fishing bare-chested in
Russia's Altai region, and was shown on television diving into an icy river and swimming the butterfly stroke.
He has also tackled predators in the wild before, shooting a tiger with a tranquilizer gun and releasing leopards.

To Turkish PM Erdogan: Time to Consider all the Facts By Lanny J. Davis
http://thehill.com/opinion/columnists/lanny-davis/102357-message-to-turkish-pm-erdogan
When several years ago I first met Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and had the pleasure to have two
private conversations with him, he immediately struck me as the ultimate "purple" leader. As The Washington Post
wrote recently, "Erdogan's Justice and Development Party has religious roots, but it also draws conservative
entrepreneurs and liberals with its free-market policies."
But Erdogan has recently appeared to be hostile not only to Israel, but also to the U.S. — flirting with Holocaust denier
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and undermining (apparently unintentionally) the world's efforts to prevent Iran from
developing a nuclear weapon.
Concerning the recent flotilla incident, there is no question Israel made serious mistakes in planning, intelligence and
execution and the onboard deaths were horrible and tragic. But Erdogan's harsh criticism struck many people, even
friends of Turkey, as way over the top, ignoring basic facts.
So I ask Prime Minister Erdogan, who I still believe has a good heart and wants to do the right thing, to assume that he
faced the following purely hypothetical facts as leader of his country:
Suppose for years Greek Cypriots were shooting rockets intentionally aimed at Turkish Cypriot civilians, causing many
deaths and injuries, and as a result, Turkey instituted a blockade, insisting on searching all ships for armaments;
Suppose that you learned there was a flotilla of ships leaving Greek ports destined for Greek Cyprus, called the "Free
Turkish Cyprus" flotilla and sponsored by a Greek organization with leaders hostile to Turkey and with associations with
an anti-Turkish terrorist organization;
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775652 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775652 Date: 08/31/2015
Suppose that after you ordered that these ships be inspected for armaments and the leaders of the ships refused, your
soldiers boarding the ships were accosted by people with pipes, iron bars and long knives, putting the Turkish soldiers in
mortal danger; and your soldiers, seeing their brothers and sisters in such danger, reacted instinctively by shooting live
ammunition, tragically killing nine people, some of whom were members of the same organization linked to an anti-
Turkish terrorist organization.
Mr. Prime Minister: If all of the above were true — and in fact, each of the above "hypotheticals" precisely tracks the
circumstances Israel faced — what would you and Turkey have done?
Now, you and your Turkish colleagues may argue that the big difference is that Israel is "occupying" the West Bank. Oh,
really? An awful lot of Greeks and much of the rest of the world believe, rightly or wrongly, that Turkey is occupying one-
half of Cyprus after a military invasion years ago. I know you and your fellow Turks feel that Turkey intervened to protect
Turk Cypriots.
A lot of Turkish Muslims somehow believe that there is religious sacrilege by Israel in "occupying" holy sites in East
Jerusalem and on the West Bank. Oh, really? Tens of millions of Orthodox Christians throughout Russia, Greece,
Romania and Eastern Europe would remind you that in 1453, the Turks not only occupied the holiest site in all of
Orthodox Christendom — the Holy Agia Sophia Church, which is to Orthodox Christians what St. Peter's and the Vatican
are to Roman Catholics — but also continue to this day to desecrate that site, which Turkey retains as a museum, with
the priceless religious frescoes obscenely painted over and icons smashed, and refuse to allow the restoration of Agia
Sophia to the Orthodox Church.
Compare what the Turks did to Agia Sophia to Israel's protection of the sanctity and guaranteed absolute access by
Muslims to the holy sites on the ancient Temple Mount of the al-Aqsa Mosque facing Mecca and the Dome of the Rock
ever since Israel regained control over Jerusalem in 1967. These are facts, Mr. Prime Minister. Do you deny them?
I am hoping that once you discover the entire truth about the risks to Israel's safety and security represented by these
Gaza-bound ships, and recognize that Turkey's history and role in being an occupier is not free from criticism, you will
find a way to re-engage your prior friendship and relationship with Israel, especially with regard to the peace process,
and open discussions with Israeli leaders, who I know appreciated the constructive role you have played over the years.
Even if publicly you cannot do this, I am hoping that you can privately — which would be consistent with my impression
of the man I came to know and admire after just two meetings. I can only hope and pray that you do so, and that the
world doesn't lose you as a peacemaker in the Middle East and elsewhere.

'Inept' US cannot fix Afghanistan: top Saudi prince Sun, May 16, 2010
RIYADH (AFP) — An "inept" United States cannot fix Afghanistan's problems and should simply focus on "chasing the
terrorists" there, former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal said on Saturday.
The ex-ambassador to the United States also challenged Washington to produce results in just-started Middle East
peace talks, and accused US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of undermining efforts to make the region nuclear-free.
AFP — Saudi Arabia's former intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal delivers a speech during a conference ...
In a speech in Riyadh before diplomats, Turki said US-led NATO troops had irrevocably alienated the Afghan people and
• had no hope of rebuilding the country.
"What Afghanistan needs now is a shift from nation-building to effectively countering terrorists," Turki told the Arab
News conference.
US President Barack Obama "should not be misdirected into believing that he can fix Afghanistan's ills by military
means."
"Hunt down the terrorists on both sides of the Afghan-Pakistan border, arrest them or kill them, and get out, and let the
Afghan people deal with their problems.
"As long as GI boots remain on Afghan soil, they remain targets of resistance for the Afghan people and ideological
mercenaries."
Turki, who has long served a central role in Saudi-Afghan relations, scolded Washington's handling of relations with
Kabul.
"The inept way in which this administration has dealt with President (Hamid) Karzai beggars disbelief and amazement.
"Both sides are now filled with resentment and a sour taste in their mouths," he said. "How can they both get out of that
situation? I don't know."

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775701 Date: 08/31/2015
The chairman of the King Faisal Center For Research and Islamic Studies, Turki has no official position but is believed to
often reflect high level thinking in the Saudi government.
He is the brother of Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal, and analysts speculate he could become foreign minister
when Saud retires.
Turki said Arab states have given Washington four months to show progress in US-guided Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
"The Arab world has given Obama until September to get things done," said Turki.
"It is not enough to talk the talk. He has to walk the walk.
"If he does not succeed... then I (will) ask President Obama to do the morally decent gesture and recognise the
Palestinian state that he so ardently wishes to exist.
"He can then pack up and leave us in peace and let the Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese negotiate directly with the
Israelis. No more platitudes and good wishes and visions, please."
Turki also faulted the US and European approach in trying to halt Iran's alleged efforts to build a nuclear weapon.
"The discussions on Iran's nuclear ambitions started off on the wrong foot. The carrot and stick approach does not
work," he said.
For one, he said, the US and Europe have had double-standards in dealing with Iran on the one hand, and other nuclear
countries on the other.
"You cannot askIran to play on one level while you allow Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea to play on other levels."
Turki said a successful strategy toward Iran requires even-handedness, a "universal nuclear security umbrella" for the
countries in the area, and "a good military option" against any regional country which does not cooperate.
He said Clinton had undermined efforts to move toward a regional nuclear-free zone, after the UN Security Council's five
permanent members recently expressed support for the idea.
"Alas... Clinton then voided the issue of its value by stating that the conditions do not yet exist for establishing the zone,"
he said.
"Why, then, did she join the other members of the P5 in issuing their statement?"
Turki said he hoped Obama "will find the way to correct his secretary of state's nullification of making our area free of
weapons of mass destruction."
Turki also warned of rising violence in Iraq after the pullout of US troops next year, warning both internal and external
groups seek to carve up the country.
"Imagine what will happen once internal strife and fighting escalates" following the US pullout, he said.
Without a UN Security Council effort to protect Iraq's current borders, the consequence could be "regional conflict on a
scale not seen since the Ottoman-Safavid wars of the 17th and 18th centuries," he warned.

The Failure of the American Jewish Establishment

Benjamin Netanyahu; drawing by John Springs In 2003, several prominent Jewish philanthropists hired Republican
pollster Frank Luntz to explain why American Jewish college students were not more vigorously rebutting campus
criticism of Israel. In response, he unwittingly produced the most damning indictment of the organized American Jewish
community that I have ever seen.
The philanthropists wanted to know what Jewish students thought about Israel. Luntz found that they mostly didn't. "Six
times we have brought Jewish youth together as a group to talk about their Jewishness and connection to Israel," he
reported. "Six times the topic of Israel did not come up until it was prompted. Six times these Jewish youth used the
word 'they' rather than `us' to describe the situation."
That Luntz encountered indifference was not surprising. In recent years, several studies have revealed, in the words of
Steven Cohen of Hebrew Union College and Ari Kelman of the University of California at bavis, that "non-Orthodox
younger Jews, on the whole, feel much less attached to Israel than their elders," with many professing "a near-total
absence of positive feelings." In 2008, the student senate at Brandeis, the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored university
in America, rejected a resolution commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the Jewish state.

Luntz's task was to figure out what had gone wrong. When he probed the students' views of Israel, he hit up against
some firm beliefs. First, "they reserve the right to question the Israeli position." These young Jews, Luntz explained,
"resist anything they see as 'group think." They want an "open and frank" discussion of Israel and its flaws. Second,
"young Jews desperately want peace." When Luntz showed them a series of ads, one of the most popular was entitled
"Proof that Israel Wants Peace," and listed offers by various Israeli governments to withdraw from conquered land.
Third, "some empathize with the plight of the Palestinians." When Luntz displayed ads depicting Palestinians as violent
and hateful, several focus group participants criticized them as stereotypical and unfair, citing their own Muslim friends.
Most of the students, in other words, were liberals, broadly defined. They had imbibed some of the defining values of
American Jewish political culture: a belief in open debate, a skepticism about military force, a commitment to human
rights. And in their innocence, they did not realize that they were supposed to shed those values when it came to Israel.
The only kind of Zionism they found attractive was a Zionism that recognized Palestinians as deserving of dignity and
capable of peace, and they were quite willing to condemn an Israeli government that did not share those beliefs. Luntz
did not grasp the irony. The only kind of Zionism they found attractive was the kind that the American Jewish
establishment has been working against for most of their lives.
Among American Jews today, there are a great many Zionists, especially in the Orthodox world, people deeply devoted
to the State of Israel. And there are a great many liberals, especially in the secular Jewish world, people deeply devoted
to human rights for all people, Palestinians included. But the two groups are increasingly distinct. Particularly in the
younger generations, fewer and fewer American Jewish liberals are Zionists; fewer and fewer American Jewish Zionists
are liberal. One reason is that the leading institutions of American Jewry have refused to foster—indeed, have actively
opposed—a Zionism that challenges Israel's behavior in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and toward its own Arab citizens.
For several decades, the Jewish establishment has asked American Jews to check their liberalism at Zionism's door, and
now, to their horror, they are finding that many young Jews have checked their Zionism instead.
Morally, American Zionism is in a downward spiral. If the leaders of groups like AIPAC and the Conference of Presidents
of Major American Jewish Organizations do not change course, they will wake up one day to find a younger, Orthodox-
dominated, Zionist leadership whose naked hostility to Arabs and Palestinians scares even them, and a mass of secular
American Jews who range from apathetic to appalled. Saving liberal Zionism in the United States—so that American
Jews can help save liberal Zionism in Israel—is the great American Jewish challenge of our age. And it starts where
Luntz's students wanted it to start: by talking frankly about Israel's current government, by no longer averting our eyes.
Since the 1990s, journalists and scholars have been describing a bifurcation in Israeli society. In the words of Hebrew
University political scientist Yaron Ezrahi, "After decades of what came to be called a national consensus, the Zionist
narrative of liberation [has] dissolved into openly contesting versions." One version, "founded on a long memory of
persecution, genocide, and a bitter struggle for survival, is pessimistic, distrustful of non-Jews, and believing only in
Jewish power and solidarity." Another, "nourished by secularized versions of messianism as well as the Enlightenment
idea of progress," articulates "a deep sense of the limits of military force, and a commitment to liberal-democratic
values." Every country manifests some kind of ideological divide. But in contemporary Israel, the gulf is among the
widest on earth.
As Ezrahi and others have noted, this latter, liberal-democratic Zionism has grown alongside a new individualism,
particularly among secular Israelis, a greater demand for free expression, and a greater skepticism of coercive authority.
You can see this spirit in "new historians" like Tom Segev who have fearlessly excavated the darker corners of the Zionist
past and in jurists like former Supreme Court President Aharon Barak who have overturned Knesset laws that violate the
human rights guarantees in Israel's "Basic Laws." You can also see it in former Prime Minister Ehud Barak's apparent
willingness to relinquish much of the West Bank in 2000 and early 2001.
But in Israel today, this humane, universalistic Zionism does not wield power. To the contrary, it is gasping for air. To
understand how deeply antithetical its values are to those of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, it's
worth considering the case of Effi Eitam. Eitam, a charismatic ex–cabinet minister and war hero, has proposed ethnically
cleansing Palestinians from the West Bank. "We'll have to expel the overwhelming majority of West Bank Arabs from
here and remove Israeli Arabs from [the] political system," he declared in 2006. In 2008, Eitam merged his small Ahi
Party into Netanyahu's Likud. And for the 2009-2010 academic year, he is Netanyahu's special emissary for overseas
"campus engagement." In that capacity, he visited a dozen American high schools and colleges last fall on the Israeli
government's behalf. The group that organized his tour was called "Caravan for Democracy."
Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman once shared Eitam's views. In his youth, he briefly joined Meir Kahane's now
banned Kach Party, which also advocated the expulsion of Arabs from Israeli soil. Now Lieberman's position might be
called "pre-expulsion." He wants to revoke the citizenship of Israeli Arabs who won't swear a loyalty oath to the Jewish

state. He tried to prevent two Arab parties that opposed Israel's 2008-2009 Gaza war from running candidates for the
Knesset. He said Arab Knesset members who met with representatives of Hamas should be executed. He wants to jail
Arabs who publicly mourn on Israeli Independence Day, and he hopes to permanently deny citizenship to Arabs from
other countries who marry Arab citizens of Israel.
You don't have to be paranoid to see the connection between Lieberman's current views and his former ones. The more
you strip Israeli Arabs of legal protection, and the more you accuse them of treason, the more thinkable a policy of
expulsion becomes. Lieberman's American defenders often note that in theory he supports a Palestinian state. What
they usually fail to mention is that for him, a two-state solution means redrawing Israel's border so that a large chunk of
Israeli Arabs find themselves exiled to another country, without their consent.
Lieberman served as chief of staff during Netanyahu's first term as prime minister. And when it comes to the West Bank,
Netanyahu's own record is in its way even more extreme than his protégé's. In his 1993 book, A Place among the
Nations, Netanyahu not only rejects the idea of a Palestinian state, he denies that there is such a thing as a Palestinian.
In fact, he repeatedly equates the Palestinian bid for statehood with Nazism. An Israel that withdraws from the West
Bank, he has declared, would be a "ghetto-state" with "Auschwitz borders." And the effort "to gouge Judea and Samaria
[the West Bank] out of Israel" resembles Hitler's bid to wrench the German-speaking "Sudeten district" from
Czechoslovakia in 1938. It is unfair, Netanyahu insists, to ask Israel to concede more territory since it has already made
vast, gut-wrenching concessions. What kind of concessions? It has abandoned its claim to Jordan, which by rights should
be part of the Jewish state.
On the left of Netanyahu's coalition sits Ehud Barak's emasculated Labor Party, but whatever moderating potential it
may have is counterbalanced by what is, in some ways, the most illiberal coalition partner of all, Shas, the ultra-
Orthodox party representing Jews of North African and Middle Eastern descent. At one point, Shas—like some of its
Ashkenazi ultra-Orthodox counterparts—was open to dismantling settlements. In recent years, however, ultra-Orthodox.
Israelis, anxious to find housing for their large families, have increasingly moved to the West Bank, where thanks to
government subsidies it is far cheaper to live. Not coincidentally, their political parties have swung hard against
territorial compromise. And they have done so with a virulence that reflects ultra-Orthodox Judaism's profound hostility
to liberal values. Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, Shas's immensely powerful spiritual leader, has called Arabs "vipers," "snakes,"
and "ants." In 2005, after Prime Minister Ariel Sharon proposed dismantling settlements in the Gaza Strip, Yosef urged
that "God strike him down." The official Shas newspaper recently called President Obama "an Islamic extremist."
Hebrew University Professor Ze'ev Sternhell is an expert on fascism and a winner of the prestigious Israel Prize.
Commenting on Lieberman and the leaders of Shas in a recent Op-Ed in Haaretz, he wrote, "The last time politicians
holding views similar to theirs were in power in post—World War II Western Europe was in Franco's Spain." With their
blessing, "a crude and multifaceted campaign is being waged against the foundations of the democratic and liberal
order." Sternhell should know. In September 2008, he was injured when a settler set off a pipe bomb at his house.
Israeli governments come and go, but the Netanyahu coalition is the product of frightening, long-term trends in Israeli
society: an ultra-Orthodox population that is increasing dramatically, a settler movement that is growing more radical
and more entrenched in the Israeli bureaucracy and army, and a Russian immigrant community that is particularly prone
to anti-Arab racism. In 2009, a poll by the Israel Democracy Institute found that 53 percent of Jewish Israelis (and 77
percent of recent immigrants from the former USSR) support encouraging Arabs to leave the country. Attitudes are
worst among Israel's young. When Israeli high schools held mock elections last year, Lieberman won. This March, a poll
found that 56 percent of Jewish Israeli high school students—and more than 80 percent of religious Jewish high school
students—would deny Israeli Arabs the right to be elected to the Knesset. An education ministry official called the
survey "a huge warning signal in light of the strengthening trends of extremist views among the youth."
You might think that such trends, and the sympathy for them expressed by some in Israel's government, would occasion
substantial public concern—even outrage—among the leaders of organized American Jewry. You would be wrong. In
Israel itself, voices from the left, and even center, warn in increasingly urgent tones about threats to Israeli democracy.
(Former Prime Ministers Ehud Olmert and Ehud Barak have both said that Israel risks becoming an "apartheid state" if it
continues to hold the West Bank. This April, when settlers forced a large Israeli bookstore to stop selling a book critical
of the occupation, Shulamit Aloni, former head of the dovish Meretz Party, declared that "Israel has not been
democratic for some time now.") But in the United States, groups like AIPAC and the Presidents' Conference patrol
public discourse, scolding people who contradict their vision of Israel as a state in which all leaders cherish democracy
and yearn for peace.
The result is a terrible irony. In theory, mainstream American Jewish organizations still hew to a liberal vision of Zionism.
On its website, AIPAC celebrates Israel's commitment to "free speech and minority rights." The Conference of Presidents
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775710 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775710 Date: 08/31/2015
declares that "Israel and the United States share political, moral and intellectual values including democracy, freedom,
security and peace." These groups would never say, as do some in Netanyahu's coalition, that Israeli Arabs don't deserve
full citizenship and West Bank Palestinians don't deserve human rights. But in practice, by defending virtually anything
any Israeli government does, they make themselves intellectual bodyguards for Israeli leaders who threaten the very
liberal values they profess to admire.
After Israel's elections last February, for instance, Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice-chairman of the Presidents'
Conference, explained that Avigdor Lieberman's agenda was "far more moderate than the media has presented it."
Insisting that Lieberman bears no general animus toward Israeli Arabs, Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-
Defamation League, told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that "He's not saying expel them. He's not saying punish them."
(Permanently denying citizenship to their Arab spouses or jailing them if they publicly mourn on Israeli Independence
Day evidently does not qualify as punishment.) The ADL has criticized anti-Arab bigotry in the past, and the American
Jewish Committee, to its credit, warned that Lieberman's proposed loyalty oath would "chill Israel's democratic political
debate." But the Forward summed up the overall response of America's communal Jewish leadership in its headline
"Jewish Leaders Largely Silent on Lieberman's Role in Government."
Not only does the organized American Jewish community mostly avoid public criticism of the Israeli government, it tries
to prevent others from leveling such criticism as well. In recent years, American Jewish organizations have waged a
campaign to discredit the world's most respected international human rights groups. In 2006, Foxman called an Amnesty
International report on Israeli killing of Lebanese civilians "bigoted, biased, and borderline anti-Semitic." The Conference
of Presidents has announced that "biased NGOs include Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Christian Aid,
[and] Save the Children." Last summer, an AIPAC spokesman declared that Human Rights Watch "has repeatedly
demonstrated its anti-Israel bias." When the Obama administration awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Mary
Robinson, former UN high commissioner for human rights, the ADL and AIPAC both protested, citing the fact that she
had presided over the 2001 World Conference Against Racism in Durban, South Africa. (Early drafts of the conference
report implicitly accused Israel of racism. Robinson helped expunge that defamatory charge, angering Syria and Iran.)
Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are not infallible. But when groups like AIPAC and the Presidents'
Conference avoid virtually all public criticism of Israeli actions—directing their outrage solely at Israel's neighbors—they
leave themselves in a poor position to charge bias. Moreover, while American Jewish groups claim that they are simply
defending Israel from its foes, they are actually taking sides in a struggle within Israel between radically different Zionist
visions. At the very moment the Anti-Defamation League claimed that Robinson harbored an "animus toward Israel," an
alliance of seven Israeli human rights groups publicly congratulated her on her award. Many of those groups, like
B'Tselem, which monitors Israeli actions in the Occupied Territories, and the Israeli branch of Physicians for Human
Rights, have been at least as critical of Israel's actions in Lebanon, Gaza, and the West Bank as have Amnesty
International and Human Rights Watch.
All of which raises an uncomfortable question. If American Jewish groups claim that Israel's overseas human rights critics
are motivated by anti- Israeli, if not anti-Semitic, bias, what does that say about Israel's domestic human rights critics?
The implication is clear: they must be guilty of self-hatred, if not treason. American Jewish leaders don't generally say
that, of course, but their allies in the Netanyahu government do. Last summer, Israel's vice prime minister, Moshe
Ya'alon, called the anti-occupation group Peace Now a "virus." This January, a right-wing group called Im Tirtzu accused
Israeli human rights organizations of having fed information to the Goldstone Commission that investigated Israel's Gaza
war. A Knesset member from Netanyahu's Likud promptly charged Naomi Chazan, head of the New Israel Fund, which
supports some of those human rights groups, with treason, and a member of Lieberman's party launched an
investigation aimed at curbing foreign funding of Israeli NGOs.
To their credit, Foxman and other American Jewish leaders opposed the move, which might have impaired their own
work. But they are reaping what they sowed. If you suggest that mainstream human rights criticism of Israel's
government is motivated by animus toward the state, or toward Jews in general, you give aid and comfort to those in
Israel who make the same charges against the human rights critics in their midst.
In the American Jewish establishment today, the language of liberal Zionism—with its idioms of human rights, equal
citizenship, and territorial compromise—has been drained of meaning. It remains the lingua franca in part for
generational reasons, because many older American Zionists still see themselves as liberals of a sort. They vote
Democratic; they are unmoved by biblical claims to the West Bank; they see average Palestinians as decent people
betrayed by bad leaders; and they are secular. They don't want Jewish organizations to criticize Israel from the left, but
neither do they want them to be agents of the Israeli right.

These American Zionists are largely the product of a particular era. Many were shaped by the terrifying days leading up
to the Six-Day War, when it appeared that Israel might be overrun, and by the bitter aftermath of the Yom Kippur War,
when much of the world seemed to turn against the Jewish state. In that crucible, Israel became their Jewish identity,
often in conjunction with the Holocaust, which the 1967 and 1973 wars helped make central to American Jewish life.
These Jews embraced Zionism before the settler movement became a major force in Israeli politics, before the 1982
Lebanon war, before the first intifada. They fell in love with an Israel that was more secular, less divided, and less shaped
by the culture, politics, and theology of occupation. And by downplaying the significance of Avigdor Lieberman, the
settlers, and Shas, American Jewish groups allow these older Zionists to continue to identify with that more internally
cohesive, more innocent Israel of their youth, an Israel that now only exists in their memories.
But these secular Zionists aren't reproducing themselves. Their children have no memory of Arab armies massed on
Israel's border and of Israel surviving in part thanks to urgent military assistance from the United States. Instead, they
have grown up viewing Israel as a regional hegemon and an occupying power. As a result, they are more conscious than
their parents of the degree to which Israeli behavior violates liberal ideals, and less willing to grant Israel an exemption
because its survival seems in peril. Because they have inherited their parents' liberalism, they cannot embrace their
uncritical Zionism. Because their liberalism is real, they can see that the liberalism of the American Jewish establishment
is fake.
To sustain their uncritical brand of Zionism, therefore, America's Jewish organizations will need to look elsewhere to
replenish their ranks. They will need to find young American Jews who have come of age during the West Bank
occupation but are not troubled by it. And those young American Jews will come disproportionately from the Orthodox
world.
Because they marry earlier, intermarry less, and have more children, Orthodox Jews are growing rapidly as a share of
the American Jewish population. According to a 2006 American Jewish Committee (AJC) survey, while Orthodox Jews
make up only 12 percent of American Jewry over the age of sixty, they constitute 34 percent between the ages of
eighteen and twenty-four. For America's Zionist organizations, these Orthodox youngsters are a potential bonanza. In
their yeshivas they learn devotion to Israel from an early age; they generally spend a year of religious study there after
high school, and often know friends or relatives who have immigrated to Israel. The same AJC study found that while
only 16 percent of non-Orthodox adult Jews under the age of forty feel "very close to Israel," among the Orthodox the
figure is 79 percent. As secular Jews drift away from America's Zionist institutions, their Orthodox counterparts will likely
step into the breach. The Orthodox "are still interested in parochial Jewish concerns," explains Samuel Heilman, a
sociologist at the City University of New York. "They are among the last ones who stayed in the Jewish house, so they
now control the lights."
But it is this very parochialism—a deep commitment to Jewish concerns, which often outweighs more universal ones—
that gives Orthodox Jewish Zionism a distinctly illiberal cast. The 2006 AJC poll found that while 60 percent of non-
Orthodox American Jews under the age of forty support a Palestinian state, that figure drops to 25 percent among the
Orthodox. In 2009, when Brandeis University's Theodore Sasson asked American Jewish focus groups about Israel, he
found Orthodox participants much less supportive of dismantling settlements as part of a peace deal. Even more
tellingly, Reform, Conservative, and unaffiliated Jews tended to believe that average Palestinians wanted peace, but had
been ill-served by their leaders. Orthodox Jews, by contrast, were more likely to see the Palestinian people as the
enemy, and to deny that ordinary Palestinians shared any common interests or values with ordinary Israelis or Jews.
Orthodox Judaism has great virtues, including a communal warmth and a commitment to Jewish learning unmatched in
the American Jewish world. (I'm biased, since my family attends an Orthodox synagogue.) But if current trends continue,
the growing influence of Orthodox Jews in America's Jewish communal institutions will erode even the liberal-
democratic veneer that today covers American Zionism. In 2002, America's major Jewish organizations sponsored a large
Israel solidarity rally on the Washington Mall. Up and down the east coast, yeshivas shut down for the day, swelling the
estimated Orthodox share of the crowd to close to 70 percent. When the then Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul
Wolfowitz told the rally that "innocent Palestinians are suffering and dying as well," he was booed.
America's Jewish leaders should think hard about that rally. Unless they change course, it portends the future: an
American Zionist movement that does not even feign concern for Palestinian dignity and a broader American Jewish
population that does not even feign concern for Israel. My own children, given their upbringing, could as easily end up
among the booers as among Luntz's focus group. Either prospect fills me with dread.
In 2004, in an effort to prevent weapons smuggling from Egypt, Israeli tanks and bulldozers demolished hundreds of
houses in the Rafah refugee camp in the southern Gaza Strip. Watching television, a veteran Israeli commentator and

'politician named Tommy Lapid saw an elderly Palestinian woman crouched on all fours looking for her medicines amid
the ruins of her home. He said she reminded him of his grandmother.
In that moment, Lapid captured the spirit that is suffocating within organized American Jewish life. To begin with, he
watched. In my experience, there is an epidemic of not watching among American Zionists today. A Red Cross study on
malnutrition in the Gaza Strip, a bill in the Knesset to allow Jewish neighborhoods to bar entry to Israeli Arabs, an Israeli
human rights report on settlers burning Palestinian olive groves, three more Palestinian teenagers shot—it's unpleasant.
Rationalizing and minimizing Palestinian suffering has become a kind of game. In a more recent report on how to foster
Zionism among America's young, Luntz urges American Jewish groups to use the word "Arabs, not Palestinians," since
"the term 'Palestinians' evokes images of refugee camps, victims and oppression," while "Arab' says wealth, oil and
Islam.

Of course, Israel—like the United States—must sometimes take morally difficult actions in its own defense. But they are
morally difficult only if you allow yourself some human connection to the other side. Otherwise, security justifies
everything. The heads of AIPAC and the Presidents' Conference should ask themselves what Israel's leaders would have
to do or say to make them scream "no." After all, Lieberman is foreign minister; Effi Eitam is touring American
universities; settlements are growing at triple the rate of the Israeli population; half of Israeli Jewish high school
students want Arabs barred from the Knesset. If the line has not yet been crossed, where is the line?
What infuriated critics about Lapid's comment was that his grandmother died at Auschwitz. How dare he defile the
memory of the Holocaust? Of course, the Holocaust is immeasurably worse than anything Israel has done or ever will
do. But at least Lapid used Jewish suffering to connect to the suffering of others. In the world of AIPAC, the Holocaust
analogies never stop, and their message is always the same: Jews are licensed by their victimhood to worry only about
themselves. Many of Israel's founders believed that with statehood, Jews would rightly be judged on the way they
treated the non-Jews living under their dominion. "For the first time we shall be the majority living with a minority,"
Knesset member Pinchas Lavon declared in 1948, "and we shall be called upon to provide an example and prove how
Jews live with a minority."
But the message of the American Jewish establishment and its allies in the Netanyahu government is exactly the
opposite: since Jews are history's permanent victims, always on the knife-edge of extinction, moral responsibility is a
luxury Israel does not have. Its only responsibility is to survive. As former Knesset speaker Avraham Burg writes in his
remarkable 2008 book, The Holocaust Is Over; We Must Rise From Its Ashes, "Victimhood sets you free."
This obsession with victimhood lies at the heart of why Zionism is dying among America's secular Jewish young. It simply
bears no relationship to their lived experience, or what they have seen of Israel's. Yes, Israel faces threats from
Hezbollah and Hamas. Yes, Israelis understandably worry about a nuclear Iran. But the dilemmas you face when you
possess dozens or hundreds of nuclear weapons, and your adversary, however despicable, may acquire one, are not the
dilemmas of the Warsaw Ghetto. The year 2010 is not, as Benjamin Netanyahu has claimed, 1938. The drama of Jewish
victimhood—a drama that feels natural to many Jews who lived through 1938, 1948, or even 1967—strikes most of
today's young American Jews as farce.
But there is a different Zionist calling, which has never been more desperately relevant. It has its roots in Israel's
Independence Proclamation, which promised that the Jewish state "will be based on the precepts of liberty, justice and
peace taught by the Hebrew prophets," and in the December 1948 letter from Albert Einstein, Hannah Arendt, and
others to The New York Times, protesting right-wing Zionist leader Menachem Begin's visit to the United States after his
party's militias massacred Arab civilians in the village of Deir Yassin. It is a call to recognize that in a world in which
Jewish fortunes have•radically changed, the best way to memorialize the history of Jewish suffering is through the
ethical use of Jewish power.
For several months now, a group of Israeli students has been traveling every Friday to the East Jerusalem neighborhood
of Sheikh Jarrah, where a Palestinian family named the Ghawis lives on the street outside their home of fifty-three years,
from which they were evicted to make room for Jewish settlers. Although repeatedly arrested for protesting without a
permit, and called traitors and self-haters by the Israeli right, the students keep coming, their numbers now swelling into
the thousands. What if American Jewish organizations brought these young people to speak at Hillel? What if this was
the face of Zionism shown to America's Jewish young? What if the students in Luntz's focus group had been told that
their generation faces a challenge as momentous as any in Jewish history: to save liberal democracy in the only Jewish
state on earth?
"Too many years I lived in the warm embrace of institutionalized elusiveness and was a part of it," writes Avraham Burg.
"I was very comfortable there." I know; I was comfortable there too. But comfortable Zionism has become a moral
abdication. Let's hope that Luntz's students, in solidarity with their counterparts at Sheikh Jarrah, can foster an

they care enough to try.

You may have been alerted to this incident: the barring of Noam Chomsky from Israel. His political views may be
ridiculous or objectionable, though he is the greatest linguistic scholar in the world, but barring him for his political
opinions has created a needless PR disaster, not least for the us, as he is, after all, a US citizen, and a very prominent
one internationally. It is unfortunate on every level. And the US should not be a passive onlooker. He is a US citizen
barred for his political views, after all. This story is splashed across the European press this morning. Not what anyone
needs, yes, yes, like a hole in the head, and bone stupid, but the US effort on his behalf to gain entry should be part of
the story. This incident can be profitable if Israel understands it should not be doing this to US or European critics in the
future. This is a downward slope, bad news for everyone involved. S

Chomsky Barred From West Bank by Israel
By ROBERT MACKEY <http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/author/robert-mackey/>
Noam Chomsky, an American linguist and political thinker who has been critical of Israel, was denied entry into the West
Bank on Sunday by Israeli immigration officials when he tried to cross into the Palestinian territory from Jordan to
deliver a lecture.
Amira Hass of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported <http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/noam-chomsky-denied-
entry-into-israel-and-west-bank-1.290701> :
No reason was initially given for the decision, but the Interior Ministry later said immigration officials at the Allenby
Bridge border crossing from Jordan had misunderstood Chomsky's intentions thinking initially he was also due to visit
Israel. Chomsky, who is on a speaking tour in the region, was scheduled to speak at Bir Zeit University in the West Bank
on Monday.
A spokeswoman for Israel's interior ministry also told Reuters
<http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE64F23H20100516> that there had been a misunderstanding and "officials
were trying to get clearance from the Israeli military, which controls access to the West Bank to allow Chomsky to
enter."
In a television interview from Amman, Jordan, after he was rebuffed, Mr. Chomsky told Al Jazeera English, "the facts
were completely clear to everyone; there was no basis for a misunderstanding." He explained that he was interrogated

for several hours before being told that he would not be allowed to cross into the occupied Palestinian territory. The 81-
year-old scholar added:
I can only say what was conveyed to me in the discussion with the official who was carrying out the interrogation — he
was receiving instructions from the [Israeli] ministry of interior and relaying them. There were two basic points. One was
that the government of Israel does not like the kinds of things I say — which puts them into the category of I suppose
every other government in the world. The second was that they seemed upset about the fact that I was just taking an
invitation from Bir Zeit and I had no plans to go on to speak in Israeli universities, as I have done many times in the past
but not this time.
Mr. Chomsky had been invited to speak about American foreign and domestic policy by the philosophy department at
the Palestinian university in Ramallah <http://www.birzeit.edu/news/21160/news> .
The renowned linguist was outspoken in his opposition to the Israeli offensive in Gaza
<http://web.mit.edu/cis/eventposter_011309_chomsky.html> , which ended in January 2009 and has criticized Israel's
occupation of Palestinian territory many times.
In an interview <http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/02/magazine/way-we-live-now-11-02-03-questions-for-noam-
chomsky-professorial-provocateur.html> with Deborah Solomon of The New York Times Magazine in 2003, Mr.
Chcimsky said, "I objected to the founding of Israel as a Jewish state. I don't think a Jewish or Christian or Islamic state is
a proper concept. I would object to the United States as a Christian state." When Ms. Solomon pressed Mr. Chomsky on
his opposition to Israel, saying, "Your father was a respected Hebraic scholar, and sometimes you sound like a self-hating
Jew," he replied:
It is a shame that critics of Israeli policies are seen as either anti-Semites or self-hating Jews. It's grotesque. If an Italian
criticized Italian policies, would he be seen as a self-hating Italian?

The below by Kouchner is worth reading if you haven't seen it.
The Internet: a critical international policy issue, by Bernard Kouchner (May 10, 2010)
In 2015, three and a half billion people - half of mankind - will have access to the Internet. There has never been such a
revolution in the freedom of communication and the freedom of expression. But how will this new medium be used?
What new distortions and obstacles will the enemies of the Internet come up with?
Modern technology leads to the best and the worst. Extremist, racist and defamatory websites and blogs disseminate
odious opinions in real time. They have made the Internet into a weapon of war and hate. Websites are attacked and
Internet users are recruited through chatrooms for destructive plots. Violent movements are infiltrating social networks
to spread propaganda and false information.
It is very hard for democracies to control them. I do not subscribe to the naïve belief that a new technology, however
efficient and powerful it may be, is bound by nature to advance liberty on all fronts.
Yet, all the same, the distortions are the exception rather than the rule. The Internet is above all the most fantastic
means of breaking down the walls and boundaries that close us off from each other. For the oppressed peoples, who
have been deprived of their right to self-expression and the right to choose their own future, the Internet provides
power beyond their wildest hopes. In minutes, news and images recorded on a telephone can be disseminated
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775744 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775744 Date: 08/31/2015
worldwide in cyberspace. It is increasingly difficult the hide a public demonstration, an act of repression or a violation of
human rights.
In authoritarian and repressive countries, mobile telephones and the Internet have given rise to public opinion and civil
society. They have also given citizens a critical means of expression, despite all the restrictions.
However, the temptation to repress free expression is always present. The number of countries that censor the Internet,
that monitor web users and punish them for their opinions, is increasing at an alarming rate. The Internet can be used
against citizens. It can be a formidable intelligence-gathering tool to spot potential dissidents. Some regimes are already
acquiring increasingly sophisticated surveillance technology.
If all of those who are attached to human rights and democracy refused to compromise their principles and used the
Internet to defend freedom of expression, this kind of repression would be much more difficult. I am not talking about
absolute freedom that opens the door to all sorts of abuses. Nobody is promoting that. Instead, I'm talking about real
freedom, which is based on the principle of respecting human dignity and human rights.
In the last few years, multilateral institutions, such as the Council of Europe, and non-governmental organisations, such
as Reporters Without Borders, along with thousands of individuals around the world, have made a strong commitment
to these issues. This is proof, if proof were needed, that this issue does not pit the West against the rest of the world. No
fewer than 180 countries meeting for the World Summit on the Information Society acknowledged that the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights applies fully to the Internet, especially Article 19, which establishes freedom of expression
and freedom of opinion. And yet, some fifty countries fail to live up to their commitments.
For the occasion of World Press Freedom Day, I have brought together experts, NGO leaders, journalists, business
people and intellectuals this week. Their discussions have confirmed my conviction that the path we want to take is the
right one. I think that we should create an international instrument for monitoring the commitments that governments
have made and for calling them to task when they fail to live up to them. I think we should provide assistance to
cyberdissidents, who should get the same support as other victims of political repression, and of the need to show our
solidarity with them publicly, in close collaboration with the NGOs working on these issues. I think that we should also
discuss the wisdom of adopting a code of conduct regarding the export of technologies for censoring the Internet and
tracking web users.
These issues, along with others, such as the protection of personal data on the Internet and the right of digital amnesty
for everyone promoted by my colleague Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, should be addressed within a framework that
brings together government, civil society and international experts.
Another project is close to my heart. It will be a long and difficult task to implement it, but it is critical. It is to give the
Internet a legal status that reflects its universality. One that recognizes it as an international space, so that it will be
more difficult for repressive governments to use the sovereignty argument against fundamental freedoms.
This is a critical issue. I think that the battle of ideas has started with, on one side, the advocates of a universal and open
Internet, based on freedom of expression and freedom of association, on tolerance and respect for privacy and, on the
other side, those who want to transform the Internet into a multitude of spaces that are closed off from each other to
serve the purposes of a regime, propaganda and all forms of fanaticism.
Freedom of expression is "the foundation of all other freedoms". Without it, there are no "free nations", Voltaire said.
This spirit of the Enlightenment, which is universal, should run through the new media. The defence of fundamental
freedoms and human rights must be the priority for governance of the Internet. It is everyone's business.

FYI, from WHA:
Mexican law enforcement officials cannot stop individuals and require proof of migratory status. However, like SB1070,
officials in the course of official "contact" (i.e. Traffic stops, investigations, hot pursuit) are authorized to request proof
of migratory status. They do this in practice routinely. Frequently, individuals who cannot prove legal status are referred
to INM (federal CBP-equivalent). In practice, GoM authorities at all levels engage in exploitative treatment of migrants,
primarily Central Americans heading to the US. These abuses have been well documented by international human rights
groups, as well as by multiple documentary and news media reports.

Dear Hillary and Anne-Marie,
For several months I've been advising on a project to take the rainforest restoration work of Dr. Willie Smits, an
Indonesian agroforester, to scale on Borneo. That Smits Model effort now has an economically sustainable design with
multiple benefits for the local forest population, the nation of Indonesia, and the planet. The business plan has been
developed by an experienced and highly reputable investment group that serves in an Advisory role to the Prince of
Wales's Trust, and the business plan has already engaged the interest of the P8, a group of the eight largest global
pension funds.
The core goals of the Arenga Reforestation Project include greenhouse gas reduction, habitat restoration, rainforest
remediation, deforestation protection, biofuel production that is non-food and carbon-positive, and poverty alleviation
for some of the most vulnerable populations on the planet. The Internal Rate of Return, on a fairly mature business
model and seven years of module testing, calculates to about 34% -- a decent investment return for almost any industry.

You can watch Willie Smits describe the possibilities at TED (to a standing ovation) here:
http://www.ted.com/talks/willie_smits_restores_a_rainforest.html
The State Department has been on the periphery of the concept development through Moira O'Neill, a Haas Professor
of Business on loan to USAID from Cal. She has kept the conversation going with the White House, USAID, and State, but
is extremely busy with a range of other obligations and may not have the cycles to follow this to a conclusion.
In my view this effort, the Arenga Reforestation Project, is the leading contender for an economically sustainable
tropical reforestation program, and has an unprecedented climate mitigation potential (Indonesia is the world's #4
greenhouse-gas emitter, due largely to the burning and composting of the southern Kalimantan peat swamps and to
rapid destruction of rainforest, both of which the Smits Model can reverse). In Aug 08 I spent 11 days visiting key sites of
this project in Borneo, largely with Dr. Smits, whom I've known for about 20 years. In my opinion, and that of many
others, this is the world's most sophisticated and powerful model for integrated ecological and economic restoration,
with exciting prospects for much of the tropics. I can also vouch for the quality and integrity of the key people involved.
To make the impact even more noteworthy, the Minister of Forestry in Indonesia has now agreed to a 1:1 acreage
match between Smits Model reforestation and the protection of virgin rainforest in perpetuity as national park. For
every 30,000 hectares of Smits Model reforestation, the Ministry will designate 30,000 hectares (about 116 square
miles) of virgin rainforest a National Park, and they have agreed to external monitoring by international NGOs for
compliance. Since this Smits Model can scale to a million hectares, or ten million, with continually increasing economic,
social, and environmental benefits, the two-fer impact is perhaps unprecedented.
It would be worthwhile for you to have someone from your staff take a look at this. In my carefully considered view, the
political, social, and REDD benefits could be very substantial, and the possibility of a Public-Private Partnership is worth
consideration.
The primary source for information on the project in the US is my friend and Senior Fellow at RMI, the remarkable Eric
Rasmussen, MD, MDM, FACP CEO of the Google-founded humanitarian NGO called InSTEDD. He's leading, pro bono,
the team developing the business plan, and can be reached at or on cell at
Pacific Time Zone.

For your reading pleasure on the way home, S/P has been working on a project that I discussed with Jake a while back --
aimed at figuring out where we could do better and above all create more leverage to achieve our goals. The papers are
blunter than anything you would see from the bureaus -- they should not necessarily be read as policy blueprints but
rather as illustrations of alternative strategies. We have made sure that the special assistants have them on the plane. I
will also share the individual papers with the relevant assistant secretaries. We will then be happy to take the project
further if you approve.
You will be happy to know that rain has stopped at the Expo!

HRC: Below is ah oped on the National Security Strategy I wrote for tomorrow's Outlook.
Unfortunately, they give it a horrible title, but I think the piece turned out alright.
Best, Sandy
By Samuel R. Berger
Samuel R. Berger, chair of the global strategy firm Albright Stonebridge Group, served as national security advisor to
President Clinton from 1997 to 2001.
President Obama's National Security Strategy, released by the White House on Thursday, tackles a delicate but
unavoidable question: How do we respond to new and old security challenges in an era of financial distress at home and
a reordering of political power abroad?
For some time now, it has been clear that the definition of U.S. national security strategy needs rethinking. The
September 11 attacks, global economic crisis, cyber-terror threats and even the environmental catastrophe in the Gulf
underscore that the challenges America faces in 2010 have changed even from just a decade ago. And while America's
military supremacy is certainly not at risk, new international arrangements - such as the shift from the G-7 club of
powerful nations to the G-20, which incorporates emerging nations from China to Brazil - are needed so that the costs
and benefits of a stable international order are shared. The United States cannot solve most global threats without
others, nor should we bear the burden alone.
Enter the National Security Strategy. In my experience, these congressionally mandated documents can easily become
laborious and impenetrable, or mere compendiums of bureaucratic pleading from various parts of the government.
(Make sure you do right by Japan! Don't step on the Pentagon!) The challenge, which President Clinton insisted upon to
me and his other advisers, is to provide a strategic framework that is clarifying to the rest of the world and informs

administration decision makers up and down the line. It's not a blueprint for action, but a means to convey the
president's principles and priorities.
In Obama's case, the new sober and comprehensive 52-page strategy incorporates the new realities and breaks with
past strategies in several key respects. But it also reflects an understanding that we face enduring challenges - nuclear
proliferation, terrorism and regional conflicts - for which the best response is a return to fundamentals.
One such fundamental is the strength of our economy. At a time when the after-effects of a financial crisis and the fiscal
burden of two long wars have raised fears of an overextended America, the administration makes a case for economic
and technological renewal as a crucial underpinning of U.S. security. The president made this case in his West Point
speech last weekend. "At no time in human history," he said, "has a nation of diminished economic vitality maintained
its military and political primacy."
Another fundamental challenge is arms control and nuclear proliferation. By seeking strategic arms cuts with Russia, the
president has returned to a long bipartisan tradition that languished during the prior administration. And by convening a
global summit on securing nuclear material this spring, Obama has given new urgency and global purchase to the effort
started in 1991 when Sens. Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar first initiated a program to lock down nuclear materials.
On terrorism, the strategy builds on the past, but breaks with it as well. Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama each have
deployed all of America's tools: military power, homeland defense, law enforcement, sanctions, intelligence and
vigorous efforts to cut off terrorist financing. But the critical difference in the Obama strategy is that it rejects the Global
War on Terror lens through which the prior administration viewed the challenge. "This is not a global war against a tactic
- terrorism - or a religion - Islam," the new strategy says. "We are at war with a specific network, al-Qaeda and its
terrorist affiliates."
This sharper focus avoids alienating many in the Muslim world, ensures the support of key allies who never accepted the
broader construct and avoids the overreactions that led us to forsake the fight against aI-Qaeda fight in Afghanistan and
turn our efforts to the unrelated threat from Saddam Hussein's Iraq.
In perhaps the most dramatic departure from the strategy of its predecessor, the Obama administration has restored a
less provocative policy on the use of military force. In the 2002 national security strategy, President Bush articulated the
rationale for preemptive war just weeks before seeking a U.N. resolution to invade Iraq. The new strategy restores the
principles that have guided administrations for decades: the use of force should be a last resort, should weigh all the
costs and benefits, and should have as much international support as possible. The administration reserves the right to
act unilaterally - for example against al-Qaeda and its allies - but resurrects the principle President Clinton often
described as "together where possible, alone where necessary."
President Obama's critics have focused on his diplomatic engagement with hostile states like Iran and North Korea. The
President sets forth his rationale: "to create opportunities to resolve differences, strengthen the international
community's support for our actions, learn about the intentions and nature of closed regimes, and plainly demonstrate
to the public within those nations that their governments are to blame for their isolation."
In the case of Iran, Washington's outstretched hand has not resulted in Iran's compliance. But attempts to engage have
helped ensure that the world's attention is focused on Iran's intransigence rather than Washington's refusal to
negotiate.

Without a doubt, there are gaps between principle and practice. Despite the Obama administration's stated goal of
doubling exports in the next five years, it has not put its muscle behind trade agreements with South Korea, Panama and
Colombia. And the clarity of its call to respect human rights has at times been muted in the face of tough realities.
Sixteen months into this administration there has been much progress, but many of the true tests of this strategy lie
ahead.
In the strategy's conclusions, the Obama administration evokes an even earlier era, calling for both political parties to
restore the cooperation and common purpose so crucial to our success during the dark days of the Cold War. Despite
the intense debates at the time over nuclear arms control, Central America and détente, nearly all American supported
the containment of communism.
In that same spirit, the administration's framework deserves broad bipartisan support. We can and should argue out our
differences over detention of prisoners, methods to disarm dangerous states, how hard to push for democratic rights, or
the costs of climate change legislation. But at the same time, we can rally around the overriding U.S. foreign policy goals
spelled out in the strategy: renewing our economy at home to ensure leadership abroad; defeating al-Qaeda; succeeding
in Afghanistan; preventing nuclear proliferation; curbing climate change; and promoting an international order of
enlightened self-interest, economic prosperity and the fundamental values upon which America is based.

Subject: H: Several observations on the Israeli raid. Sid
First observation: Bibi's Entebbe in reverse. The father, Benzion Netanyahu; 100 years old, secretary to Jabotinsky, and
denounced as too radical by Begin, adored his son Yoni, heroically killed at Entebbe. Benyamin has never measured up.
Benzion has constantly criticized him in public for his deviations from the doctrine of Greater Israel. Bibi desperately
seeks his father's approbation and can never equal his dead brother. See Benzion's most recent scathing undermining of
his son Bibi and Bibi's tearful tribute to his brother just last month. The raid on the ship to Gaza resembles the raid on
Entebbe, except that there are no hostages, no guns, it's not in Africa, and it's a fiasco; otherwise, it's Entebbe. (Then,
there's Ehud Barak reliving his youth as a raider killing Palestinians in Lebanon, a feat memorialized in Spielberg's film,
Munich. Ultimately, it didn't work out well that time either. The film captures the moral quandaries, which appear to
have escaped the participants.) Further observation: The international press will inquire whether the Obama
administration gave a wink or nod as the Bush administration did for the Lebanon and Gaza incursions. Be prepared.
Further: Of course, the consequences for US foreign policy and national security are negative across the board: from the
analogy of the North Korean ship sinking and the Chinese posture to support for Iranian sanctions, etc., etc. Did the
Israelis not hear Petraeus's testimony?
Further: Of course, whatever the outcome of such a raid, one of the inevitable ones would be the death of the peace
process, such as it is, on the very eve of Bibi's scheduled visit to Obama, which would have been, under any
circumstance, in light of the raid, profoundly humiliating for the president. Or are the Israelis bone stupid? I don't think
so.

"He does not support. He supports such conditions that they (the Arabs) will never accept it. That is what I heard
from him. I didn't propose these conditions, he did. They will never accept these conditions. Not one of them."
When asked about his own personal opinion about a Palestinian state, the senior Netanyahu stated:
Herzl <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Herzl> and Nordau <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Nordau>
(fathers of zionist movement) did not labor to create a Palestinian state. This land is Jewish land and not a land for the
Arabs. There is no place here for Arabs, and there wont be a place here for the Arabs. They will never agree to the
conditions.

Netanyahu Visits Grave of Brother Who Fell in Entebbe Rescue
by Tzvi Ben Gedalyahu
Follow Israel news on Twitter <http://twitter.com/IsraelNewsStory> and Facebook
<http://www.facebook.com/pages/IsraelNationalNews/102510354100> .
On Saturday night, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu visited the grave of his brother Yoni, who fell during the daring
rescue of hijacked Israelis in Entebbe <http://www.yoni.org.il/en/jonathan.php>, Uganda in 1976.
<http://info.a7.org/php_en/c.php?b=1816&z=17&clientid=1352&dest=http://www.bneiaish.com>
He and his wife Sarah decided to go to the gravesite on Mount Herzl 24 hours before the beginning of Remembrance
Day for Fallen Soldiers in order to prevent security tie-ups for thousands of other Israelis who will visit the cemetery
Sunday night and Monday.
The Netanyahus were moved emotionally after seeing for the first time a commemorative decoration that the IDF
carved into the gravestone of Yoni, who led the rescue operation and was the only soldier to die in the maneuver. One
of his less known heroic deeds is his saving a soldier from across Syrian lines in the Yom Kippur War in 1973.
Sirens will sound throughout Israel for one minute at 8 p.m. (1 p.m. EDT) Sunday night to mark the beginning of
Memorial Day for 22,682 Fallen Soldiers and 2,431 victims
<http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/137050> of Arab terrorist attacks following the re-
establishment of the State of Israel after 2,000 years. Another 1,500 civilians were killed between 1860 and the 1948
War for Independence, when seven Arab nations attacked the fledging, newly declared state just three years after the
Holocaust ended.
On Monday morning, a two-minute siren will sound at 11 a.m. (4 a.m. EDT). (IsraelNationalNews.com)

Netanyahu pleased: I didn't capitulate
Ben Caspit, Maariv, May 27 2010 [page 2 with front page lead; Hebrew original here
<http://www.scribd.com/doc/32038200/Maariv-May27-10-Netanyahu-Says-He-Beat-Obama> and at bottom of post] In
the course of intimate conversations over the past few weeks with top political officials and civil servants, Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has said, according to his interlocutors, that he managed to defeat the US administration.
Netanyahu is pleased by the fact that the Americans failed, so he said, to twist his arm and that ultimately, in the duel
between him and the Obama administration, he was the one who emerged with the upper hand. We did not make
concessions on our red lines and they failed to make us fold and to drag us to places we didn't want to go, said
Netanyahu, according to people who heard him speak.
Netanyahu is convinced that he is not going to be forced to extend the settlement construction freeze, which is due to
expire in September. According to senior officials in Jerusalem, an agreement has already been reached with the
administration that the Israeli government will not announce an extension of the construction freeze in the territories,
and the Americans will "make sure" that the Palestinians do not withdraw from the talks. Israel, however, will not take
"aggressive" action and construction will be resumed only in areas that are clearly within the consensus inside the
settlement blocs.
The Prime Minister's Bureau vigorously denied the above report. "The statements attributed to the prime minister are
incorrect," said a spokesman in the Prime Minister's Bureau. "They were not said by Netanyahu in any forum. The
reason is simple: the prime minister does not think that, Prime Minister Netanyahu holds in great esteem the
commitment by President Obama and the administration to Israel's security and their efforts to renew the peace
process in our region."
Eli Bardenstein adds: The formal invitation that Netanyahu received yesterday to meet with President Obama next week
might attest to a radical change in the White House's attitude towards him. Political sources in Israel described the
planned meeting as "the peak of the campaign for Israel and the Jews that has been pursued by the Obama
administration in the past number of weeks." The sources said that the meeting was geared to put an end to the grave
crisis that erupted some two months ago between the Obama administration and Netanyahu over the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict and particularly over the continued construction in East Jerusalem, and to mend the mistaken impression that
was received as if Israel was "no longer an absolute ally of the United States."
That crisis, which was initiated by the Americans, elicited fierce criticism in the United States, and sparked a desire
among members of the Obama administration to rectify the situation. Another reason for the administration's desire to °
end the crisis is the fear of failure in the upcoming Congressional elections in November. "The Democratic Party's coffers
are empty. Many Democrat members of Congress and Senators have complained that if the hazing of Israel were to
continue, they would be unable to obtain donations from Jews and were liable to lose the elections," said one source in
Washington.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776099 Date: 08/31/2015
The prevalent assessment is that Netanyahu will be received far more warmly in Washington next week than he was two
months ago. This time the meeting will be covered by the media and the two leaders are expected to have their picture
taken together and to give statements to the media.
That said, sources in Washington noted that "Netanyahu is leery of the meeting with Obama and of walking into a trap
once again. He knows that the smiles notwithstanding, behind closed doors he is going to have to give answers to very
difficult questions, like 'how do you envision the end of the negotiations with the Palestinians."
Netanyahu is to begin his political travels today in Paris, where he is to attend the ceremony in honor of Israel's
acceptance into the OECD. The prime minister will be arriving in a city that is on strike, which is liable to impede his
movement through the city streets to the center of Paris for his meetings.

USUN PRESS RELEASE #109 May 31, 2010
AS DELIVERED
Remarks by Ambassador Alejandro Wolff, Deputy Permanent U.S. Representative to the United Nations, at an
Emergency Session of the Security Council, May 31, 2010
Thank you, Mr. President and thank you, Assistant Secretary-General Fernandez-Taranco.
The United States is deeply disturbed by the recent violence and regrets the tragic loss of life and injuries suffered
among those involved in the incident last night aboard the Gaza-bound ships. We are working to ascertain the facts.
We expect a credible and transparent investigation and strongly urge the Israeli government to investigate the incident
fully.
As I stated in the Chamber in December 2008, when we were confronted by a similar situation, mechanisms exist for the
transfer of humanitarian assistance to Gaza by member states and groups that want to do so. These non-provocative
and non-confrontational mechanisms should be the ones used for the benefit of all those in Gaza. Direct delivery by sea
is neither appropriate nor responsible, and certainly not effective, under the circumstances.
The United States remains deeply concerned by the suffering of civilians in Gaza, and the deterioration of the situation
there, including the humanitarian and human rights situation. We continue to believe the situation is unsustainable and
is not in the interests of any of those concerned. We will continue to engage the Israelis on a daily basis to expand the
scope and type of goods allowed into Gaza to address the full range of the population's humanitarian and recovery
needs. Hamas' interference with international assistance shipments and the work of nongovernmental organizations
complicates efforts in Gaza. Its continued arms smuggling and commitment to terrorism undermines security and
prosperity for Palestinians and Israelis alike.
We will continue to work closely with the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority, along with international
NGOs and the UN, to provide adequate access for humanitarian goods, including reconstruction materials, through the
border crossings, while bearing in mind the Government of Israel's legitimate security concerns.
Ultimately, this incident underscores the need to move ahead quickly with negotiations that can lead to a
comprehensive peace in the region. The only viable solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is an agreement,
negotiated between the parties, that ends the occupation that began in 1967 and fulfills the aspirations of both parties
for independent homelands through two states for two peoples, Israel and an independent, contiguous, and viable state
of Palestine, living side by side in peace and security. We call again on our international partners — both inside and
outside this Council — to promote an atmosphere of cooperation between the parties and throughout the entire region.
Thank you, Mr. President.

Dear Hillary and Anne-Marie,
For several months I've been advising on a project to take the rainforest restoration work of Dr. Willie Smits, an
Indonesian agroforester, to scale on Borneo. That Smits Model effort now has an economically sustainable design with
multiple benefits for the local forest population, the nation of Indonesia, and the planet. The business plan has been
developed by an experienced and highly reputable investment group that serves in an Advisory role to the Prince of
Wales's Trust, and the business plan has already engaged the interest of the P8, a group of the eight largest global
pension funds.
The core goals of the Arenga Reforestation Project include greenhouse gas reduction, habitat restoration, rainforest
remediation, deforestation protection, biofuel production that is non-food and carbon-positive, and poverty alleviation
for some of the most vulnerable populations on the planet. The Internal Rate of Return, on a fairly mature business
model and seven years of module testing, calculates to about 34% -- a decent investment return for almost any industry.
You can watch Willie Smits describe the possibilities at TED (to a standing ovation) here:
http://www.ted.com/talks/willie_smits_restores_a_rainforest.html

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776222 Date: 08/31/2015
The State Department has been on the periphery of the concept development through Moira O'Neill, a Haas Professor
of Business on loan to USAID from Cal. She has kept the conversation going with the White House, USAID, and State, but
is extremely busy with a range of other obligations and may not have the cycles to follow this to a conclusion.
In my view this effort, the Arenga Reforestation Project, is the leading contender for an economically sustainable
tropical reforestation program, and has an unprecedented climate mitigation potential (Indo'nesia is the world's #4
greenhouse-gas emitter, due largely to the burning and composting of the southern Kalimantan peat swamps and to
rapid destruction of rainforest, both of which the Smits Model can reverse). In Aug 08 I spent 11 days visiting key sites of
this project in Borneo, largely with Dr. Smits, whom I've known for about 20 years. In my opinion, and that of many
others, this is the world's most sophisticated and powerful model for integrated ecological and economic restoration,
with exciting prospects for much of the tropics. I can also vouch for the quality and integrity of the key people involved.
To make the impact even more noteworthy, the Minister of Forestry in Indonesia has now agreed to a 1:1 acreage
match between Smits Model reforestation and the protection of virgin rainforest in perpetuity as national park. For
every 30,000 hectares of Smits Model reforestation, the Ministry will designate 30,000 hectares (about 116 square
miles) of virgin rainforest a National Park, and they have agreed to external monitoring by international NGOs for
compliance. Since this Smits Model can scale to a million hectares, or ten million, with continually increasing economic,
social, and environmental benefits, the two-fer impact is perhaps unprecedented.
It would be worthwhile for you to have someone from your staff take a look at this. In my carefully considered view, the
political, social, and REDD benefits could be very substantial, and the possibility of a Public-Private Partnership is worth
consideration.
The primary source for information on the project in the US is my friend and Senior Fellow at RMI, the remarkable Eric
Rasmussen, MD, MDM, FACP CEO of the Google-founded humanitarian NGO called InSTEDD. He's leading, pro bono,
the team developing the business plan, and can be reached at or on cell at

"Sarah Palin's brand of politics, for example, defining some Americans as being from "real America" and others as
wherever it is she thinks they are from (a city, perhaps?) is bad for America. Such political warmongering implodes our
core values...
Our first calling, in politics, is to protect, honor and leave better our American system...
If we tear down the American political process by doing and saying anything to win then we have failed that calling
before we ever begin...
The campaign cycle of 2010 has had a tumultuous start. Tea Party libertarians screaming from street corners, unhappy
workers taking on incumbents, disgruntled faithful praying that the administration will keep its promises, Birthers
repelling from black helicopters into the American mainstream and town hall meetings resembling Three Stooges re-

As you know I have good links to the Qataris. Sheikha Mosah's son is the 31/32 year old Crown Prince and she is keen

Programme which is designed to deal with Qatar's food security issues its a $30 billion programme. He is aware that
food security is an issue you are majoring on and would love to meet with you in person to discuss this and to explore
potential partnership areas between US and Qatar including possible participation in the US/World Bank Food Security
Fund. He is also keen to talk more generally about US/Qatari cooperation and even suggested they could help out with
the Oil spill problem. There is apparently a Arab Food Security Summit in October 2010 and he would like to discuss Us

Hillary, as promised, I connected with Bruce Jones at NYU about Spanta. Bruce got in touch offered to help Spanta put
together an arrangement at NYU that might have a Brookings offshoot. Spanta said he needed to decide with Karzai
whether in fact the timing was right for him to leave. He just got back in touch with Bruce saying he's decided to stay on
a bit longer. That said, he's agreed to participate in some Track II regional work that Bruce has underway. All in all, it
sounds as though this has ended up in the right place for now. Bruce, Martin and I will be open to other NY/DC
possibilities down the road when Spanta's situation changes. Thanks again for the truly terrific event at Brookings.

Subj: Developments in Kyrgyzstan
I was in Kyrgyzstan from June 1– 6, during which time I met with almost all the members of the interim government,
with special focus on foreign relations, security and legal issues. Here are major points that emerged from my visit:
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776479 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776479 Date: 08/31/2015
1. Crisis in the South. Although I departed before the pogroms had commenced in Osh, I found that the interim
government fully expected violence to break out there but did not anticipate the inter-ethnic element. Several candidly
acknowledged that the government's grip on the south, particularly Osh and Djalalabad provinces, was extremely
tenuous. They said they had severe "loyalty" problems with key figures in the police and military. When I pressed on
what they meant by "loyalty," I was told that the Bakiyev family had "its people" in key positions in the police and army
and that they had intercepted communications between Janysh Bakiyev and a number of key security officers in the
south. "Something is being planned to disrupt the referendum," I was told. Beknazarov told me he believed that,
following the pattern of the last two revolutions, they anticipated that there would be an attack on administrative
offices in the south, following quickly within a few days by attacks in Bishkek. Government leaders I spoke with over the
weekend told me they now recognize they had misassessed the data they had, that the Bakiyev plan was obviously to
instigate inter-ethnic violence.
Precisely what led to the tragedy in and around Osh is still unclear and requires careful investigation, but people I have
spoken with in Osh describe police and army leaders directing the pogroms, and they were able to identify some of
these individuals as persons close to the Bakiyevs. Moreover, the timing and some of the specific descriptions of events
support this thesis—Bakiyev was the only person who clearly had something to gain from the violence. If that is so, then
Bakiyev adopted an extremely cynical, indeed criminal strategy. His objectives would have been to derail the
referendum, demonstrate the weakness of the interim government, and fuel calls for an iron-fisted central government
through the resurrection of his presidency. The tactics used bear comparison with those used by Slobodan Milosevic
and Radovan Kara&'id as Yugoslavia disintegrated or by the Soviet MVD in the waning days of the Soviet empire in
programs like "Operation Koltso." If the government's charges bear out, serious crimes were committed by the Bakiyev
faction.
While Otunbayeva publicly states that order has been restored in the south and that foreign intervention is no longer
needed, I am not persuaded that this is what she actually thinks. She is anxious to build public confidence in her
government and its abilities. Confidentially she acknowledges that the interim government's grip over the situation in
the south is extremely weak and that the government does not feel it can necessarily count on the local police and
military there, whose loyalties are plainly divided. This in turn suggests that the international community should give
active consideration to both the humanitarian and the security dimensions of the situation in the south. My sense
remains that Otunbayeva would strongly welcome such an initiative.
2. Internal Workings of the Interim Government. The interim government verges on being completely dysfunctional. It
operates as a collection of individual fiefdoms, with leaders engaged in constant squabbles over patronage
appointments. Career civil service personnel report being terrorized and extorted. I spent the better part of three days
inside the current government headquarters on Staraya Ploshchod and was able to directly observe primitive horse-
trading, threats and counterthreats between key government functionaries, sometimes in agitated voices. Roza
Otunbayeva and a handful of figures closest to her were exceptions in this process—admonishing others about the
unseemliness of their conduct, urging moderation and restraint. But Otunbayeva also acknowledges that the limitations
on her own authority and states that she "has to put up with it," at least for the moment. Three government members
advised me during meetings of their intention to resign before the end of the month in order to start running for
parliament. Significantly, I sense sharp rifts within the government—between Atembayev and Beknazarov, for instance,
who could not refrain from criticizing one another in my interviews with them, or between Sariyev and Beknazarov.
Only Otunbayeva (and to a lesser extent her close ally Elmira Ibraimova) appear to be the glue that holds things
together, commanding the respect of the other government members. I found that the admiration for Otunbayeva was
almost universal—she appears to be the only figure in the government emerging from the interim period with an
untarnished reputation. Still the special order under which she has assumed power as "president of the interim
government" presents some clear problems for her authority. She has a fixed term into 2011, but she will have no
democratic mandate. After the new government is formed, based on the parliamentary elections, they will have
democratic legitimacy and she will not—this sets up a situation in which her authority may well be eclipsed or at least
made more narrow. Still, all the members of the current government recognize that she has essential skills that they do

There is an expectation that the parliamentary elections will result in a weeding out of the government. The next
government is expected to be formed through a parliamentary coalition. But only two or perhaps three of the current
seven factions will survive. Much of the bickering and instability in the current government is keyed to the coming game
of parliamentary moving chairs—there is an intense struggle now to secure personal loyalty and funds to use in the
parliamentary elections; the entire process has an aura of sink or swim about it. Ironically the immediate prospect of
parliamentary elections and the sense that they will be genuinely open and fair thus contributes to the ineptness and
near chaotic appearance of the current government.
3. Constitution and Referendum. Under the guidance of Tekebayev, the government put forward a proposed new
constitution, which it seeks to have confirmed through a referendum vote on June 27. The constitution itself does shift
the country further in the direction of a parliamentary democracy, and it contains unusual protection for parliamentary
minority factions. Government leaders told me that Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev had waded in on the
question of the constitution directly, pressing them to retain a "strong president" system. They say this was coupled
with not-very-subtle threats, and that the frontier between Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan remains closed, with harmful
consequences for the Kyrgyz economy. A major question exists about holding the referendum as scheduled. The events
in the south have resulted in the mass displacement of population and if held as planned, a large part of the population
in the south would probably be disenfranchised. However, government leaders say that their current problems all come
back to legitimacy, and they will not be able to form a government with democratic legitimacy without a new
constitution and new elections. Accordingly, they resist any further delays and are even contemplating moving the date
of the parliamentary election forward to the last week of August (it is now set for October 10). The crisis in the south
presents a severe dilemma in this regards, and it seems that this would have been Bakiyev's objective in instigating it, if
indeed he did.
4. Manas Transit Center. As expected, I discovered that the interim government is deeply fragmented on the question
of MTC. One faction headed by Otunbayeva favors a "pragmatic solution" to the base issue under which it will be
continued but placed on a more transparent basis in which the economic benefits to the government are clear.
Otunbayeva argues that the base can only be accepted under circumstances in which it presents no friction for Kyrgyz-
Russian relations; she seeks to have disputes surrounding fuel supply, for instance, resolved directly between the United
States and Russia. Another faction, headed by Beknazarov, takes a more demagogic approach, denouncing the base and
seeking its closing in internal meetings. Talking with Beknazarov, I had the clear impression that his attitudes were
entirely opportunistic—he thinks this will be a good campaign issue to use on the hustings. He suggested rather strongly
that he could accept a continued base presence under the right circumstances and that he views threats to close the
base as a sort of stick to use to extort more money and other concessions from the Americans. In general, Beknazarov
strikes me as hot-headed and crass and an untrustworthy partner in any future discussions. Atembayev also has
somewhat demagogic impulses, though they are mild by comparison. Otunbayeva, the third and most senior member
of the government engaged on base issues, is the critical voice of reason in the process. My impression based on
discussions with numerous figures is that Otunbayeva's views currently hold sway. However, all the government
members are agreed that the economic deal struck by Bakiyev is unfavorable to the Kyrgyz state and that the base must
rest on transparent economic concessions and there can be no more under-the-table dealings with political figures.
5. Resolving the Crisis in the South. I believe that two key points should be kept in mind when approaching the
humanitarian crisis that has emerged in the south. First, the crisis probably has its origins in a raw struggle for power.
The interim government's legitimacy deficit contributed to the problem, because it left the government with weak tools
to control the situation in the south. A long-term solution to the problem must involve the creation of governments at
the national (Bishkek) and regional (Osh, Djalalabad) levels that have an essential modicum of democratic legitimacy.
Delaying this process may only hasten the entire country's continued descent into chaos. This highlights the need to
conduct free, fair and open elections as quickly as possible. Second, the last thing the interim government needs is a
"Sophie's choice" between the United States and Russian Federation. International assistance needs to reflect a joint
U.S.-Russian approach and showcase U.S. and Russian leadership (not merely participation). With President Medvedev's
visit to the White House now on the horizon, this would be a good opportunity to establish joint sponsorship of an
international humanitarian initiative. Here, I believe, are the essential elements of a program that could achieve U.S.-
Russian co-sponsorship:

• An Appeal for Restraint: Although the instigation of the conflict appears clearly to rest with ethnic Kyrgyz
agitators, including a number in uniform and operating military equipment, at present both Uzbek and Kyrgyz armed
groups are involved in random shootings designed to reinforce perceptions of their group being persecuted (rapes etc.)
by another. Credible reports are suggesting that there has been political manipulation (including payment of money to
drug and other criminal gangs) aimed at fomenting violence. The attack on a sports facility set up by a prominent Uzbek
drug baron (murdered several years earlier) in Osh shortly before the violence started also suggests that criminal gangs
involved in drug transshipment had another motivation for engaging in the violence. It may be that the violence was an
initiative of the deposed president, but once it began, it provided cover for numerous incidents of score-settling and
criminal mischief. In these circumstances, a strong appeal for restraint is appropriate and martial law rules including
curfews may legitimately be imposed by the interim government. An imprimatur of support from the international
community would help establish the authority of the interim government in this process.
• Exit Corridors for Civilians: Civilians who feel threatened must be allowed to leave the high risk zones, and access
of humanitarian aid, and creation of a safe zone for humanitarian operation should be priorities at locations created to
shelter them. The EU, OSCE and UN issued a statement on June 16 calling for a humanitarian corridor in the southern
regions of Osh and Jalalabad provinces, as well as of ensuring the equitable distribution of humanitarian aid among
those in need. The cooperation of the Uzbek government may be particularly important in this process.
• Peacekeeping/Policing Operation: The international community should support special arrangements with broad
international legitimacy and participation to enhance peacekeeping and police operations in the affected area. As I
noted, even though Otunbayeva made a public statement on June 15 to the effect that foreign military/police
intervention was no longer needed, the situation remains precarious and in her confidential discussions Otunbayeva
acknowledges the benefits in confidence building that would emerge from an qualified, professional and international
presence in the region. Peacekeeping/policing operations should at a minimum include security for designated
sheltering areas for refugees and internally displaced persons and monitoring operations in tandem with local police and
military, to build confidence in their protective functions.
• Investigation of Events: a broad, credible, independent investigation should be undertaken into the events and
their origin. The investigation should be under the aegis of an international organization, such as the Security Council or
OSCE and it should be conducted by an individual of stature with strong credentials as a fact-finder and prosecutor. The
investigation should particularly take cognizance of accusations that crimes against humanity were perpetrated,
potentially including crimes of genocide. The involvement of persons exercising ostensible government authority—
policemen, military figures, leaders of the civil administration—should be given special scrutiny in this process. The
person commissioned to handle the investigation should be specifically empowered to recommend criminal charges be
brought against individuals identified in his investigation—either by the criminal authorities of the Kyrgyz Republic or
before an international body seized of proper jurisdiction.
• Effective Post-Conflict Reconstruction. UN authorities are estimating that as many as 450,000 persons may have
been displaced by the current violence. The devastation in central Osh and in numerous villages is reported to be near
total. There will be an intense housing shortage and a crisis with respect to food supply and healthcare. The
international community under United States and Russian leadership should provide generous support to jumpstart the
reconstruction process, prioritizing its assistance to benefit those most egregiously injured by the violence.
• The Referendum/Parliamentary Elections. In view of the disruption and violence, the interim government may
well conclude that the constitutional referendum must be postponed. However, if it does not postpone the referendum,
then extraordinary measures should be taken to insure that internally displaced persons and refugees are given an
opportunity to vote—in both cases this will be a reemphasis of the bond of citizenship and a promise of inclusion in the
democratic process that will be critical to the resolution of the crisis. The international community should also mobilize
observers in connection with the parliamentary elections to help assure that candidates have fair access to the ballot
and to media, that campaigns are permitted to proceed without unreasonable limitations and that voting occurs in a fair
and free manner across the country. Special attention in this process should be given to the affected areas to insure
that refugees and IDPs have a fair opportunity to vote and are freed from unreasonable limitations in the process.

Subject: Quartet statement
Below is the final text of the Quartet statement, which Lavrov, Ban, and Ashton have now agreed to release *without a
call.* Sounds like your discussion with Lavrov did the trick:
The Quartet re-affirms that the current situation in Gaza, including the humanitarian and human rights situation of the
civilian population, is unsustainable, unacceptable, and not in the interests of any of those concerned. The Quartet
reiterates its call for a solution that addresses Israel's legitimate security concerns, including an end to weapons
smuggling into Gaza; promotes Palestinian unity based on the Palestine Liberation Organization commitments and the
reunification of Gaza and the West Bank under the legitimate Palestinian Authority; and ensures the unimpeded flow of
humanitarian aid, commercial goods and persons to and from Gaza, consistent with United Nations Security Council
resolution 1860 (2009). The Quartet declares its readiness to work closely with Israel, the Palestinian Government and
international donors in order to achieve sustainable economic development on the basis of the full implementation of
the Agreement on Access and Movement of 2005 and in the broader perspective of the two-state solution.
Consistent with these objectives, the Quartet and the Quartet Representative have worked with Israel, as well as
consulting the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, and other concerned parties, to effect a fundamental change in policy in
Gaza. The new policy towards Gaza just announced by the Government of Israel is a welcome development. The Quartet
notes that the elaboration of further details and modalities of implementation will be important in ensuring the
effectiveness of the new policy. Full and effective implementation will comprise a significant shift in strategy towards
meeting the needs of Gaza's population for humanitarian and commercial goods, civilian reconstruction and
infrastructure, and legitimate economic activity as well as the security needs of Israel. The Quartet will continue to work
with Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and other concerned parties to ensure these arrangements are implemented as
quickly as possible. The Quartet affirms that much work remains to achieve fully the solution stated above, and, in
consultation with the concerned parties, it will monitor closely the implementation of the policy in all its aspects. It will
actively explore additional ways to improve the situation in Gaza, encourage involvement of the PA at the crossings and
promote greater commerce between the West Bank and Gaza.
The Quartet stresses the importance of United Nations and other international interventions, as well as the work of local
non-governmental organizations, to be expanded in Gaza to meet urgent civilian needs, and calls on all parties to fully
enable this work.
The Quartet recognizes that Israel has legitimate security concerns that must continue to be safeguarded, and believes
efforts to maintain security while enabling movement and access for Palestinian people and goods are critical. The
Quartet commits to work with Israel and the international community to prevent the illicit trafficking of arms and
ammunition into Gaza. It urges all those wishing to deliver goods to do so through established channels so that their

cargo can be inspected and transferred via land crossings into Gaza. The Quartet emphasizes that there is no need for
unnecessary confrontations and calls on all parties to act responsibly in meeting the needs of the people of Gaza.
The Quartet also calls for an end to the deplorable detention of Gilad Shalit in advance of the fourth anniversary of his
capture on June 25; it further condemns the violation of Hamas' international obligation to provide him access by the
International Committee of the Red Cross and demands that Hamas immediately remedy the situation.
The Quartet also reiterates its support for proximity talks toward the resumption, without pre-conditions, of direct
bilateral negotiations that resolve all final status issues as previously agreed by the parties. The Quartet believes these
negotiations should lead to a settlement, negotiated between the parties within 24 months, that ends the occupation
which began in 1967 and results in the emergence of an independent, democratic, and viable Palestinian state in the
West Bank and Gaza, living side by side in peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours.

For your reading pleasure on the way home, S/P has been working on a project that I discussed with Jake a while back --
aimed at figuring out where we could do better and above all create more leverage to achieve our goals. The papers are
blunter than anything you would see from the bureaus -- they should not necessarily be read as policy blueprints but
rather as illustrations of alternative strategies. We have made sure that the special assistants have them on the plane. I
will also share the individual papers with the relevant assistant secretaries. We will then be happy to take the project

Madam Secretary:
If you don't know my personal news yet (and I assume that you might through either Huma or Philippe), then here it is: I
Let me say first and foremost: I hope you don't see this as me leaving you or your team. I have asked the question many
times to Philippe and Huma about how you would take this news and the answer has always been the same - that you
would be happy for me - and I truly do hope that this is the case. The truth is that I applied while working in PA/PL and
was eventually wait listed and usually when wait listed you are not given the option to defer. That is neither here nor
there, but Philippe and Huma have both been incredible mentors to me throughout this entire decision-making process,
and for this, I am most grateful to them both.
The decision was not an easy one. First, Madam Secretary, you know when we first met: Believe it or not, it has been
over ten years now, You have not only been a role model and a
mentor for me throughout the years, but I have watched you behind closed doors; out in public; and quite frankly, I have
watched you both win and lose. And whether winning or losing, you are courageous: no matter what, you are
determined and inspirational.
I have seen many people join your team, leave your team, some work for a few years, others for many - and everyone
says they will still be "part of the family." Some seem to remain in touch; others don't. I see myself as a little different;
maybe you don't. Both you and President Clinton have watched me grow since I was young. More than anything, I truly
hope to remain a "part of the family."
Sometimes people ask me why I have been dedicated to working for you for so many years. It is not for fame or glory.
The truth is, I have worked for you because I have always believed in you. You are one of a kind -
there is no other one like you, and there never will be. I truly believe that the world needs you in whatever capacity that
you are in. And more than anything, I am most appreciative and thankful for all that you have offered me: Not only the
mentorship and guidance but the continuous opportunities to learn. On my own path of public service, I can truly say
that I was able to learn time and time again from the very best.
Parting from your team is thus not an easy task for me, especially leaving Philippe's direct team, where I really enjoy
what I am doing. But I also feel that I want to take another next step forward/a different one in my own life. And I am
hopeful that this is not a permanent goodbye in any way. I hope that you and I can remain in touch via email, and I
promise not to email too often, as I know how busy you are.

The Secretary had a conversation with Senator Levin today about Jackson/Vanik — Levin told her that the Administration
has been opposed to his efforts to lift the Jackson Vanik restrictions pertaining to Russia. He said that Administration
officials have been telling him that the Russians don't want them lifted. This didn't make a whole lot of sense to me, but
she asked me to follow-up with you to find out our current posture on Jackson Vanik and Russia. She'd like to get back

Re: UK politics/economy
1. UK polls show support for the Lib-Dems after the launch of the draconian Cameron government budget cratering.
LD support is down to 16 percent, half what it was at its peak during the election and half of LD members now express a
desire to defect from their party. They feel deceived by LD ministers' participation in a Tory budget opposed to their
own beliefs. In Parliament, a secret caucus of LDs is meeting with Labour about opposing the budget. Meanwhile, short
term support for Cameron is static and for the government slightly up, but only translated to the Tories. Both the Tories
and Labour are up, profiting from the LD quandary. The scenario is potentially portentous for the LD Party: There was
once an influential Australian Liberal Democratic Party, holding 11 percent of the vote and the balance of power in the
Australian Senate. Upon reaching its zenith in 1996 the ALDP supported a Liberal (that is to say, a conservative)
government's budget and suffered collapse. Today the ALDP holds 1 percent of the seats in the lower House. The
political effect of the conservative budget will almost certainly lead to an implosion of the Tory-LD coalition. In the short
run it's possible the Tories will emerge having the greatest plurality of support. But if their budget does not produce
prosperity they will pay the price, too. See Stiglitz's analysis below on the Tory budget with cold analysis of the US
predicament.
2. The implications for US-UK cooperation are apparent. While there are spheres that remain, they are contingent,
including the Afghanistan War, opposed by 75 percent of UK public and about which Cameron felt compelled this week
to declare UK engagement would end in five years (that is, before the next UK election). On economic policy, the UK is
no partner and no bridge to Europe, where the Merkel government has entered a fugue state of vertigo (another

subject). At no other time since World War II have the US and UK governments been at such odds over international
economics. With JFK and Macmillan, Macmillan accepted the postwar Keynesian consensus. Reagan and Thatcher, of
course, were of one mind ideologically, and the international economy was buoyed by Reagan's hyper-Keynesianism
masked as Thatcherism. Unfortunately, Obama did not reach out to Brown, who sought to reestablish the special
relationship around international economic recovery. Speaking of laissez faire, Cameron must be let alone to receive the
consequences (within 18 months) of his ideologically driven economics. Can he be engaged on international
development? Or does his budget rule that out too? There's not much there.
3. The Labour Party leadership contest is heating up. David Miliband has an article out today on how the Cameron
budget will foster "a lost generation." More on that soon...

Osborne's first Budget? It's wrong, wrong, wrong!
Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel prizewinner who predicted the global crisis, delivers his verdict on the Chancellor's first Budget
and tells Paul Vallely it will take the UK deeper into recession and hit millions — the poorest — badly Sunday, 27 June 2010
George Osborne will probably not be very bothered that there is a man who thinks he got last week's emergency Budget
almost entirely wrong. But he should be. Because that man is a former chief economist at the World Bank who won the
Nobel Prize for Economics for his work on why markets do not produce the outcomes which, in theory, they ought to.
Professor Joseph Stiglitz, who has been described as the biggest brain in economics, is distinctly unimpressed by George
Osborne's strategy. This, he predicts, will make Britain's recovery from recession longer, slower and harder than it needs
to be. The rise in VAT could even tip us into a double-dip recession.
Stiglitz, who was once Bill Clinton's senior economic adviser, is now professor of economics and finance at Columbia
Business School. He was in the UK this week at the University of Manchester, where he chairs the Brooks World Poverty
Institute, but he lifted his head from the detail of international development to scrutinise the economic strategy of the
Conservative Chancellor whose Liberal Democrat partners recently reversed their judgement that massive public
spending cuts now would endanger the economy and joined in the Tory slash-and-burn strategy. They were deeply
wrong to do so, he believes.
It would be a mistake to ignore Stiglitz on this. He has a track record of getting his predictions right. He was one of the
few economists who predicted the global financial meltdown long before it occurred.
"What happened was very much in accord with what I expected," he tells me when we meet for a coffee outside the
Blackwell bookshop in the centre of the university. "The data was pretty clear about that." And the scale of the crash?
"That wasn't a surprise," he adds, in a matter-of-fact manner. "The bigger the bubble, the bigger the burst.
"The thing most economists did not fully grasp was the extent to which the banks engaged in murky risk-taking activities.
They were taking a risk with our money, their shareholders' money, the bond-holders' money," he says. Banks were
demanding up to 40 per cent of the corporate profits, saying their innovative financing was adding value. But "all this
talk about innovation was a sham" because it did not relate to any real increase in the economy's productivity, he says.
"There was a prima facie case of something screwy going on [with all the] perverse incentives that would lead them to
take excessive risk. But there was no way anyone could know or believe that the banks were [conducting themselves] at
that level of stupidity. I predicted that there was going to be a collapse because of the information asymmetry problems
that were being created." His Nobel prize was given for exactly that — showing how markets fail because different people
in them hold different levels of information.
Yet there is no hint of I-told-you-so about Stiglitz's tone as he asks the waiter for coffee. He orders decaffeinated, but
suggests the British economy needs the opposite: a stiff stimulant rather than the "fiscal consolidation" which is George
Osborne's economic euphemism for cuts.
Fiscal stimulus is out of fashion now. World leaders embarked on that strategy — injecting money to re-energise the
economy — after the banking crash three years ago. It was widely perceived not to have worked because the money
governments pumped into the banks was not passed on to ailing businesses or individuals in trouble with their
mortgages.
"The problem was that, in the US, the stimulus wasn't big enough," he says. "Too much of it was in tax cuts. And when
they gave money to the banks they gave it to the wrong banks and, as a result, credit has not been restored — we can
expect a couple of million or more homes to be repossessed this year than last year — and the economy has not been

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777221 Date: 08/31/2015
restarted." Instead of producing a consensus that the government should have done more, it has created disillusion that
the government can do anything, Stiglitz says.
The result is that, following the attacks by the financial markets on Greece and then Spain, everybody is now in a mood
of retrenchment. "It's not just pre-Keynesian, it's Hooverite," he says. By which he means governments are not just
refusing to stimulate, they are making cuts, as Herbert Hoover did in the US in 1929 — when he turned the Wall Street
Crash into the Great Depression. "Hoover had this idea that, whenever you go into recession, deficits grow, so he
decided to go for cuts — which is what the foolish financial markets that got us into this trouble in the first place now
want."
It has become the new received wisdom throughout Europe. But it is the classic error made by those who confuse a
household's economics with those of a national economy.
"If you have a household that can't pay its debts, you tell it to cut back on spending to free up the cash to pay the debts.
But in a national economy, if you cut back on your spending, then economic activity goes down, nobody invests, the
amount of tax you take goes down, the amount you pay out in unemployment benefits goes up — and you don't have
enough money to pay your debts.
"The old story is still true: you cut expenditures and the economy goes down. We have lots of experiments which show
this, thanks to Herbert Hoover and the IMF," he adds. The IMF imposed that mistaken policy in Korea, Thailand,
Indonesia, Argentina and hosts of other developing countries in the 1980s and 1990s. "So we know what will happen:
economies will get weaker, investment will get stymied and it's a downward vicious spiral. How far down we don't know
— it could be a Japanese malaise. Japan did an experiment just like this in 1997; just as it was recovering, it raised VAT
and went into another recession."
Then why have we not learned from all that? Because politicians like George Osborne are driven by ideology; the
national deficit is an excuse to shrink the state because that is what he wanted anyway. Because the financial market
only cares about one thing — getting repaid. And because other European governments are panicking because of the
market's wild attack on Greece and Spain, and they don't want to be next.
"But cutbacks in Germany, Britain and France will mean all of Europe will suffer. The cuts will all feed back negatively.
And if everyone follows this policy, their budget deficits will get worse, so they will have to make more cuts and raise
taxes more. It's a vicious downward spiral. We're now looking at a long, hard, slow recovery with the possibility of a
double dip if everybody cuts back at the same time. The best scenario is long and hard ... and the worst is much worse. If
any one of these countries is forced into default, the banking system is so highly leveraged that it could cause real
problems. This is really risky, really scary."
So what should we be doing? "The lesson is not that you cut back spending, but that you redirect it. You cut out the war
in Afghanistan. You cut a couple of hundred billion dollars of wasteful military expenditure. You cut out oil subsidies.
There's a long list of things we can cut. But you increase spending in other areas, such as research and development,
infrastructure, education" — areas where government can get a good return on the investment of public money. "I
haven't done the calculation for Britain, but, for the US, all you need is a return on government investment of 5 to 6 per
cent and the long-term deficit debt is lowered."
Taxes also need to be restructured. Osborne has increased capital gains tax for high earners from 18 to 28 per cent.
"There's absolutely no reason why you couldn't tax speculative gains [from rising house or land prices] by 40 per cent.
There's no social return on it and land is going to be there whether people have speculated or not. But you lower the tax
on investment in things like R&D."
Stiglitz has one more practical solution to offer. Governments should set up their own banks to restart lending to
businesses and save struggling homeowners from repossession. "If the banks aren't lending, let's create a new lending
facility to do that job," he says. "In the US, we gave $700bn to the banks; if we had used a fraction of that to create a
new bank, we could have financed all the lending that was needed."
Indeed, it could be done for far less. "Take $100bn, lever that at 10 to 1 [by attracting funds from the private sector] and
that's a trillion-dollar new lending capacity — more than the real economy needs."
Such a move would help ordinary people more than all Osborne's rhetoric about being tough but fair. Stiglitz is sceptical,
too, about the moral underpinning of a Budget which claims that "we are all in this together", but then hits the poorest
hardest.
Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies has suggested that the Chancellor's Budget will cost the poor 2.5 per cent of
their income, while the rich will lose just 1 per cent. "I've not made an independent study on that point, but cuts in
public services will have a disproportionate effect on the poor," Stiglitz says. Osborne's Budget "may be well-
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777221 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777221 Date: 08/31/2015
intentioned, but it takes an enormous amount of work to make sure that a package of public spending cuts of that
magnitude doesn't hit the poor disproportionately".
His big fear is that overseas aid, which has been protected in this first round of cuts, will not escape a second.
"Developing countries have redirected themselves towards Asia, and China in particular, in recent years, so growth in
Africa will be more robust than one might have expected, given the severity of the downturn," he says.
Even so, aid remains vital to poor countries. "If aid is cut back, growth will be badly affected," he says. "China is
providing aid, but its aid is all in infrastructure, whereas aid from the US and Europe is mainly in education and health -
areas in which ordinary people will suffer most if there are cuts."
Joseph Stiglitz has come full circle. What the world needs now — developing and developed — is not retrenchment but
greater economic stimulus. It is not a message many are in the mood to hear. But they didn't listen to him last time,
either. And he turned out to be right, and they were wrong — and at what a cost to us all.

As you know I have good links to the Qataris. Sheikha Mosah's son is the 31/32 year old Crown Prince and she is keen
that he starts to build a wider international profile. He has been appointed head of the Qatar National Food Security
Programme which is designed to deal with Qatar's food security issues its a $30 billion programme. He is aware that
food security is an issue you are majoring on and would love to meet with you in person to discuss this and to explore
potential partnership areas between US and Qatar including possible participation in the US/World Bank Food Security
Fund. He is also keen to talk more generally about US/Qatari cooperation and even suggested they could help out with
the Oil spill problem. There is apparently a Arab Food Security Summit in October 2010 and he would like to discuss Us
participation in that too.

IS a meeting possible he is more flexible on place and times than his mother! Or maybe we could set up an initial phone
call.
Can you let me know if this appeals to you at all?
