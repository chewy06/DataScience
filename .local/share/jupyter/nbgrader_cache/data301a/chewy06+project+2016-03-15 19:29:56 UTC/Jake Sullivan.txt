Remarks on the Deaths of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya
Remarks
Hillary Rodham Clinton
Secretary of State
Treaty Room
Washington, DC
September 12, 2012
Yesterday, our U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya was attacked. Heavily armed militants assaulted the compound
and set fire to our buildings, American and Libyan security personnel battled the attackers together, Four Americans
were killed, They included Sean Smith, a Foreign Service information management officer, and our Ambassador to Libya
Chris Stevens. We are still making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals.
This is an attack that should shock the conscience of people of all faiths around the vvorld. We condemn in the strongest
terms this senseless act of violence, and we send our prayers to the families, friends, and colleagues of those we've lost.
All over the world, every day, America's diplomats and development experts risk their lives in the service of our country
and our values, because they believe that the United States must be a force for peace and progress in the world, that

these aspirations are worth striving and sacrificing for. Alongside our men and women in uniform, they represent the
best traditions of a bold and generous nation.
In the lobby of this building, the State Department, the names of those who have fallen in the line of duty are inscribed
in marble. Our hearts break over each one. And now, because of this tragedy, we have new heroes to honor and more
friends to mourn.
Chris Stevens fell in love with the Middle East as a young Peace Corps volunteer teaching English in Morocco. He joined
the Foreign Service, learned languages, won friends for America in distant places, and made other people's hopes his
own.
In the early days of the Libyan revolution, I asked Chris to be our envoy to the rebel opposition. He arrived on a cargo
ship in the port of Benghazi and began building our relationships with Libya's revolutionaries. He risked his life to stop a
tyrant, then gave his life trying to help build a better Libya. The world needs more Chris Stevenses. I spoke with his
sister, Ann, this morning, and told her that he will be remembered as a hero by many nations.
Sean Smith was an Air Force veteran. He spent 10 years as an information management officer in the State Department,
he was posted at The Hague, and was in Libya on a brief temporary assignment. He was a husband to his wife Heather,
with whom I spoke this morning. He was a father to two young children, Samantha and Nathan. They will grow up being
proud of the service their father gave to our country, service that took him from Pretoria to Baghdad, and finally to
Benghazi.
The mission that drew Chris and Sean and their colleagues to Libya is both noble and necessary, and we arid the people
of Libya honor their memory by carrying it forward. This is not easy. Today, many Americans are asking indeed, I asked
myself — how could this happen? How could this happen in a country we helped liberate, in a city we helped save from
destruction? This question reflects just how complicated and, at times, how confounding the world can be
But we must be clear-eyed, even in our grief. This was an attack by a small and savage group — not the people or
Government of Libya. Everywhere Chris and his team went in Libya, in a country scarred by war and tyranny, they were
hailed as friends and partners. And when the attack came yesterday, Libyans stood and fought to defend our post, Some
were wounded. Libyans carried Chris' body to the hospital, and they helped rescue and lead other Americans to safety.
And last night, when I spoke with the President of Libya, he strongly condemned the violence and pledged every effort
to protect our people and pursue those responsible.
The friendship between our countries, borne out of shared struggle, will not be another casualty of this attack. A free
and stable Libya is still in America's interest and security, and we will not turn our back on that nor will we rest until
those responsible for these attacks are found and brought to justice. We are working closely with the Libyan authorities
to move swiftly and surely. We are also working with partners around the world to safeguard other American embassies,
consulates, and citizens.
There will be more time later to reflect, but today, we have work to do. There is no higher priority than protecting our
men and women wherever they serve. We are working to determine the precise motivations and methods of those who
carried out this assault. Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior, along with the protest that took place at our
Embassy in Cairo yesterday, as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet. America's commitment to
religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear —there is no justification for this,
none. Violence like this is no way to honor religion or faith. And as long as there are those who would take innocent life
in the name of God, the world will never know a true and lasting peace.

It is especially difficult that this happened on September 11th. It's an anniversary that means a great deal to all
Americans. Every year on that day, we are reminded that our work is not yet finished, that the job of putting an end to
violent extremism and building a safe and stable world continues. But September 11th means even more than that. It is a
day on which we remember thousands of American heroes, the bonds that connect all Americans, wherever we are on
this Earth, and the values that see us through every storm. And now it is a day on which we will remember Sean, Chris,
and their colleagues.
May God bless them, and may God bless the thousands of Americans working in every corner of the world who make
this country the greatest force for peace, prosperity, and progress, and a force that has always stood for human dignity —
the greatest force the world has ever known. And may God continue to bless the United States of America.
Thank you.

Subject: AbZ and Hb3 on Libya and West Bank/Gaza
(SBU) I had back-to-back phone calls this morning from Qatari PM/FM Hamad bin Jassim and UAE Foreign
Minister Abdullah bin Zayed. The content was virtually identical, su esting either rare coincidence or, more
likely, an unusual level of UAE-Qatari coordination at yesterday's Arab League meeting. Main points (mostly
Libya related but one Palestinian-related) are as follows:
(SBU) No-Fly Zone: The Arab League has now called for a NFZ; the UNSC needs to act. Syria was the last hold-
out, but the resolution passed. Time is wasting. Both HbJ and AbZ made the right kind of noises (but still less
than a solid commitment) that there would be some kind of Qatari and Emirati participation in an
international effort. Their chicken-and-egg question to me was, are we going to support a NFZ? If we are,
then we can talk about the other participation.
(SBU) Recognizing the Council: Both urged us to do so. I noted that the Arab League statement fell short of
recognition. They urged us to find some kind of language that would suggest moving in that direction, and I
noted our decisions to suspend the operations of the Libyan Embassy, have S meet with Mahmoud Jibril of the
Council, and send a diplomatic representative to Benghazi. They pushed for more, with HbJ going to far as to
say that recognition of the Council will help underscore to Qadhafi and his circle that he's finished.
(SBU) Jibril meeting: They each said the same thing that Gene Cretz has picked up separately, that Jibril
doesn't want media for his meeting with S unless he feels that there will be something significant out of the
meeting. HbJ is providing a plane for Jibril to get to Paris. HbJ more than AbZ agreed with me that the
meeting itself is a significant deliverable; AbZ urged us not to be slower or quieter than France.
(SBU) West Bank/Gaza: Both reacted negatively to Israeli announcements regarding "hundreds of houses" in
the West Bank. They asked if we were going to say anything; I noted we were still at this point getting the
facts. "Jeff, you guys just aren't serious," AbZ complained. I noted the political context, in which a family was
brutally murdered.

Jake -- I was so moved by Hillary's powerful presence today on the screen as I watched along with millions in America
and around the world. She was emphathetic and unflinching and inspiring; she was wise and steady and strong. My 80
year old mother called from LA to say "She was like our rock of Gibraltar". What greater compliment for the Secretary of
State on such an awful day? I salute her as well as you and your colleagues who crafted her remarks under tremendous
time and factual constraints. It really showed everyone the stuff of which she's made. With admiration and affection --

GOP's October surprise?
They're calling it the "Jimmy carter Strategy": Exploit
Libya attack to paint Obama as weak on terrorism
By Craig Unger_g:
(Credit: AP/AlBehrman/Salon)
According to a highly reliable source, as Mitt Romney and President 13arack Obama prepare for the
first presidential debate Wednesday night, top Republican operatives are primed to unleash a new
two-pronged offensive that will attack Obama as weak on national security, and will be based, in part,
on new intelligence information regarding the attacks in Libya that killed U.S. ambassador Chris
Stevens on September
The source, who has first-hand knowledge of private, high-level conversations in the Romney camp
that took place in Washington, DC last week, said that at various times the GOP strategists referred to
their new operation as the Jimmy Carter Strategy or the October Surprise.
He added that they planned to release what they hoped would be "a bombshell" that would make
Libya and Obama's foreign policy a major issue in the campaign. "My understanding is that they have

come up with evidence that the Mama administration had positive intelligence that there was going
to be a terrorist attack on the intelligence."
The source described the Republicans as chortling with glee that the Obama administration
"definitely had inter" about the attack before it happened. "Intelligence can be graded in different
ways," he added, "and sometimes A and B don't get connected. But [the Romney campaign] will try to
paint it to look like Mama had advance knowledge of the attack and is weak on terrorism?'
He said they were jubilant about their new strategy and said they intended to portray Obama as a
helpless, Jimmy Carter-like president and to equate the tragedy in Libya with President Carter's failed
attempt to rescue American hostages in Iran in 1980. "They are so excited about it," he said. "Over
and over again they talked about how it would be just like Jimmy Carter's failed raid. They feel it is
going to give them a last-minute landslide in the election."
The source, however, said he was dubious about the tactic. "To me, it is indicative that they have lost
touch with a huge portion of the electorate," he said.
The source declined to reveal the names of the GOP operatives who were present. But he said, "These
were the top guys in the party. It was a private, unguarded planning conversation." He further
described participants in the meeting as consisting of well-known names tied to the big Republican
super PACs and people who had access to high-level national security intelligence.
"As usual, Karl Rove wasn't present," he said, "but some were close to Rove."
The source said that "there was quite a bit more" to the operation than simply revealing the
intelligence regarding Libya. He declined to discuss what he described as the second phase of the
operation.
However, already there is evidence that the first phase of the operation is underway. On Wednesday,
September 26, on Fox News, Karl Rove called Obama's reaction to what happened in Libya
"inexplicable" and added that Obama is "more intent on campaigning than meeting his
responsibilities as commander-in-chief." He went on to warn that Obama's policies in Libya
endangered the U.S. with regard to Iran. "I am astonished," Rove said. "We are projecting weakness
when we need to be projecting strength."
Similarly, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a one-time GOP presidential hopeful who
became known as the mayor of OA, followed Rove in criticizing Obama on the attack in Libya. "This
is a deliberate attempt to cover up the truth, from an administration that claimed it wanted to be the
most transparent in history," he told Fox News. "And it's the worst kind of cover-up: the kind of
cover-up that involves our national security. This is a cover-up that involves the slaughter of four
Americans."
Giuliani added that the Obama White House wanted to dismiss the role played by al-Qaeda because it
seemed to diminish the triumph of having killed Osama bin Laden. "I think it's because they have this
narrative that they defeated al-Qaeda," he said. "They never say the words 'Islamic fundamentalist
terrorism'. They want to wish it away. The president was moving on to Asia - he was going to declare
this a great victory for himself and unfortunately, this terrible act of terror intervened in their very
convenient narrative."
Likewise, Bob Corker, Republican senator from Tennessee, described the administration's response to
"the terrorist attack" in Libya as "bizarre." And on Sunday, September 30, both Mitt Romney and
vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan joined in the attacks. "I think they want to do their very best to
keep the people of America from understanding exactly what happened. We expect candor, we expect
transparency, particularly as it relates to terrorism," Romney said.
Added Ryan, "Why is he (Obama) not on the same page with his own administration officials who are
saying that this is a terrorist attack? We'll leave it up to you to decide whether it's a cover-up or not."
In an apparently related development, a Politico article posted last night said Romney advisers were
divided over how aggressively to attack President Obama over his handling of the events in Libya. One
unnamed Romney adviser described them as "a huge gift" to the campaign. "Across the board -
domestic, economic and foreign-policy issues - President °barna has been outmatched by events," he
said. "He's an observer of events, not a shaper of events. Everywhere you look, he's been outmatched."

But other Romney advisers, led by media strategist Stuart Stevens, wanted to stick to the economy as
the central issue. "They'll tell you that you've got to focus people on the fact that their economic
prospects are not very good and all that," the aide told Politico. "Well, Romney's been trying to do that
now since he clinched the nomination at the end of April — and he's failed. The president is better at
deflecting attention from the bad news than Romneyisat driving home the impact of the bad news on
individual voters."

This is it. Pretty uncompelling piece if you ask me, but of course I'm biased.
Mitt Romney: A New Course for the Middle East
Restore the three sinews of American influence: our economic strength, our military strength and the strength of our values.
Disturbing developments are sweeping across the greater Middle East. In Syria, tens of thousands of innocent people have been slaughtered. In Egypt, the Muslim
Brotherhood has come to power, and the country's peace treaty with Israel hangs In the balance. In Libya, our ambassador was murdered In a terrorist attack. U.S.
embassies throughout the region have been stormed in violent protests. And in Iran, the ayatollahs continue to move full tilt toward nuclear-weapons capability, all
the while promising to annihilate Israel.
These developments are not, as President Obama says, mere "bumps in the road." They are major issues that put our security at risk.
Yet amid this upheaval, our country seems to be at the mercy of events rather than shaping them. We're not moving them in a direction that protects our people or
our allies.
And that's dangerous. If the Middle East descends into chaos, if Iran moves toward nuclear breakout, or if Israel's security is compromised, America could be
pulled into the maelstrom.
We still have time to address these threats, but it will require a new strategy toward the Middle East
The first step is to understand how we got here. Since World War II, America has been the leader of the Free World. We're unique in having earned that role not
through conquest but through promoting human rights, free markets and the rule of law. We ally ourselves with like-minded countries, expand prosperity through
trade and keep the peace by maintaining a military second to none.
But in recent years, President Obama has allowed our leadership to atrophy. Our economy is stuck in a "recovery" that barely deserves the name. Our national
debt has risen to record levels. Our military, tested by a decade of war, is facing devastating cuts thanks to the budgetary games played by the White House.
Finally, our values have been misapplied—and misunderstood—by a president who thinks that weakness will win favor with our adversaries.
By failing to maintain the elements of our influence and by stepping away from our allies, President Obama has heightened the prospect of conflict and instability.
He does not understand that an American policy that lacks resolve can provoke aggression and encourage disorder.
The Middle East is a case in point. The Arab Spring presented an opportunity to help move millions of people from oppression to freedom. But it also presented
grave risks. We needed a strategy for success, but the president offered none. And now he seeks to downplay the significance of the calamities of the past few
weeks
The same incomprehension afflicts the president's policy toward Israel. The president began his term with the explicit policy of creating "daylight" between our two
countries. He recently downgraded Israel from being our "closest ally" in the Middle East to being only "one of our closest allies." It's a diplomatic message that will
be received clearly by Israel and its adversaries alike. He dismissed Israel's concerns about Iran as mere "noise" that he prefers to "block out." And at a time when
Israel needs America to stand with it, he declined to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
In this period of uncertainty, we need to apply a coherent strategy of supporting our partners in the Middle East—that is, both governments and individuals who
share our values.
This means restoring our credibility with Iran. When we say an Iranian nuclear-weapons capability—and the regional instability that comes with it--is unacceptable,
the ayatollahs must be made to believe us.
It means placing no daylight between the United States and Israel, And it means using the full spectrum of our soft power to encourage liberty and opportunity for
those who have for too long known only corruption and oppression. The dignity of work and the ability to steer the course of their lives are the best alternatives to
extremism.
But this Middle East policy will be undermined unless we restore the three sinews of our influence: our economic strength, our military strength and the strength Of
our values. That will require a very different set of policies from those President Obama is pursuing.

The 20th century became an American Century because we were steadfast in defense of freedom. We made the painful sacrifices necessary to defeat
totalitarianism In all of Its guises.. To defend ourselves and our allies, we paid the price in treasure and in soldiers who never came home.
Our challenges are different now, but if the 21st century is to be another American Century, we need leaders who understand that keeping the peace requires
American strength in all of its dimensions.

Romney has an op-ed in today's Wall Street Journal playing off Stevens' murder to say °barna has put
"security at risk," etc.
According to Politico yesterday, there was an internal argument within the Romney campaign over
Libya. Obviously, the neocons and the Rove oriented faction (Ed Gillespie, Rove*s surrogate is now a
Romney campaign adviser) beat Stuart Stevens.
Romney is careening from tactic to tactic, hoping something will catch.
I wouldn't be surprised to see Romney raise the specter of the Muslim Brotherhood in charge of Egypt
& Libya as a bogeyman. I have heard him do this within the last week

Subject: Tripoli trip
Here are some highlights from Tripoli. Every meeting started with condolences on Chris Stevens and his three
colleagues, and concern that Benghazi would permanently alter US Libyan relations. I used the fact of the Secretary's
meeting with President Magaref in NY last week and Deputy secretary Burns' Tripoli visit as the best evidence of US
determination to continue To build the relationship with this new democracy. In addition:
- FBI INVESTIGATION: With the PM, DFM and Judicial leaders, I placed heavy emphasis on the importance of Libyan
cooperation and transparency in the investigation. This was my primary focus; I stressed the point that Libya's
performance will no doubt color American views on Libya at a time when Libya will want to burnish its reputation.
- SECURITY: I stressed that social stability and economic growth will depend on a dramatic improvement in security. All
agreed without
hesitation. All said that Libya needs outside assistance, but when we
discussed details of how to move forward on the bilateral programs we already have underway, each was quick to
identify specific stumbling blocks on each Especially with the Acting FM, we also identified next steps.
- TRAINING: We made progress on 1208, CBW, and MANPADS training programs - details to follow front channel. We
will also follow up on judicial exchanges and forensic training.
- NEW GOVT FORMATION: Abushagur described the negotiation process as the single most difficult professional
challenge he has ever faced. He told us the government would be ready by October 3. Even though others warned us
he would miss that deadline due to difficulty in reconciling the competing demands of various parties and individuals, he
obviously made good on his Oct. 3 announcement undertaking.
- DDR: Abushagur said there are three main groups of militants to
reintegrate: part have jobs, part are heading back to university, and part will be offered vocational training. He said he
will create a new Ministry of Human Development to oversee DDR; it's unclear how this new ministry will relate to
numerous other GOL. efforts on this He expressed concern about the approximately 17,000 criminals released by
Qacihafi, some of whom joined militias.
- TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE: The political leaders and judges all pledged to strike a balance between respecting the rights
of detainees and holding human rights violators accountable. They acknowledged the profound limitations of their
justice system.

- UNSMIL: I had a very good two hr meeting with General Smith to discuss how we can partner to help the new Libyan
government improve security. He has good ideas on which we'll work closely.
I had separate meetings with PM-elect Abushagur, Acting/Deputy FM Abdel Aziz, Supreme Court President Al Dhan,
Deputy Prosecutor General Hassadi, NFA Party leader Jibril, UNSMIL Security Advisor General Smith, JCP (Muslim
Brotherhood) Party political director Elbenanni, and civil society leaders.
Morale at post is understandably rocky, but people are coping and continue to work hard in very difficult circumstances.
There are some specific issues that the Department has already solved and others on which we can work to help the
embassy in its determination to advance USG goals.
I leave for Cairo in a few minutes tonight.

Subject: RE: Itenghazi and NATO
Ivo, thanks for the helpful response. From NEA's perspective, an operational liaison with the TNC does
not constitute formal, legal recognition of the INC as the government of Libya. We don't consider
Chris Stevens' presence in Benghazi to trigger formal recognition, and we've never broken relations
with Libya despite suspending our embassy operations.
Without question, having a NATO liaison in Benghazi would have the appearance of NATO leaning in
the direction of the INC. But NATO's operations already show a considerable lean away from
Qadhati. Speaking for NEA, I don't mind the appearance. But the real purpose would be to avoid
friendly fire incidents, of course.
Cheers,
Jeff

Jeff -
Been in touch with ADMs Stavridis and Locklear. They are working the issue hard, thru both US and UK channels, to
solidify liaison cells with the rebels, The diversity of the opposition makes setting up the contacts more difficult, but the
Nato command is fully engaged in trying to set up the right structure to ensure closest possible coordination between
Naples and the TNC.
Relatedly, FR and UK are pushing the idea of sending a Nato liaison to the TNC to work the PA angle as well as to
provide a way to improve communications between INC and Nato HQ on the bigger picture. Sounds sensible, the we
need to avoid sense that Nato is recognizing TNC or wants role in any political process. Would welcome your thoughts on

Subject: Benghazi and NATO
Ivo et al: Greetings. Please look at points #3 and #4 below, conveyed by DCM Polaschik from
Embassy Tripoli, in exile on Navy Hill) from Chris Stevens, our envoy in Benghazi. This gets at a problem
that S raised with Jake Sullivan and me: coordination between the Libyan INC and NATO. S
expressed deep frustration that there doesn't seem to be an existing, working mechanism for
communication between the INC and NATO (thus leading to mistakes such as attacks on INC
tanks). She asked us to find a way to fix this, now.
The question for you and your colleagues, Ivo, is what would work quickly? Should we rely on the UK
military advisors to do this, as suggested in point 3? Or should we be encouraging the quick
formation of a NATO cell, as suggested in para 4 ( but which at least RADM Foggo suspected might
not work)? Are there other ideas? (Joan, does Chris have views, from his on-the-ground-in--Benghazi
perspective?)
We obviously need a quick, real solution to avoid more friendly fire incidents.

SWO — could you please pass this to 7th floor principals/staff? DS also needs to see this update
1) Security situation in Benghazi remains quiet. Chris Stevens & team are in the hotel, moving only for meetings as
required.
2) Chris spoke to the RADM Foggo, Deputy Commander of the 6th Fleet, who confirmed that the 6th fleet would be
responsible for the team's evacuation if needed.
3) RADM Foggo was very interested in Chris' meeting with TNC Military Coordinator Abdul Fatah Yunis, particularly
Yunis' frustration with the lack of coordination with NATO. Foggo is hopeful that presence of UK military
advisors on the ground in Benghazi will help improve this coordination. According to Fogo„ DOD is looking at
ways to improve communications with the INC, while still being mindful of red line re "boots on the ground."

4) Separately, Chris has heard from the UK Envoy that the UK and France are recommending that NATO place a
coordination cell with the TNC in order to improve coordination, reduce chances of friendly fire incidents,
etc. UK and France believe that existing coordination on a national level (which according to Chris also includes
the Italians) is not working well. When Chris briefed this to RADM Foggo, Foggo expressed concern that NATO
would not be able to reach agreement on establishment of this kind of coordination cell.

Re: Libya cabinet politics
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. As of October 5, 2012 Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf, the new interim President of Libya
told senior advisors that the abortive efforts to form a cabinet under new Prime Minister Mustafa
Abushagur represent the first step in the next phase of the struggle for control of the new Libyan
Government. According to a sensitive source Magariaf is concerned that Abushagur, supported by the
Muslim Brotherhood's (MB) Justice and Construction Party (JCP), as well as certain of the other
more traditional Islamist groups, is looking to establish day to day administrative control the new
government while defining Magariaf as a ceremonial Head of State.

2. According to this individual, the President, who is not affiliated with a particular party
holding seats in the General National Council (GNC), spoke with the new Prime Minister immediately
after Abushagur was elected by the GNC on September 12. At that time Magariaf advised him to
include in his government members of former Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril's National Forces
Alliance (NFA), Abushagar having only narrowly defeated Jibril in the GNC vote. At that time
Magariaf was not aware of the fact that Jibril had already demanded 9 cabinet seats for the NFA;
however, he did point out that even Jibril's more moderate followers were committed to the idea of a
modern Islamic state and would fit into the new cabinet. The President came away from this
discussion with the impression that Abushagur and his supporters intend to marginalize Jibril and
the 39 Members of Parliament (MP) controlled by the NFA, concentrating instead on working with
the 120 independent MPs in the GNC, looking to establish a more conservative administration. This
individual added that Abushagur made it clear that while the President was free to choose his Vice
President and staff, the Prime Minister would choose the national cabinet, supported by the GNC.
3. (Source Comment: According to this individual, Magariaf is allowing the current crisis in
the Abushagur administration to play out without direct interference. He is convinced that the desire
of the Libyan people for peace and stability, which brought him to power, added to the need to
balance the regional and political rivalries throughout the country, will lead to the formation of a
cabinet that is acceptable to all parties. Magariaf also believes that these developments will eventually
leave him as the dominant figure in the government.)
4. In addition, this individual added that Magariaf is seized with the national security
situation, the ongoing effort to disarm militia units, and the investigation of the murder of the United
States Ambassador. All of these efforts are related to what he sees as his most important role,
rebuilding the confidence of the international business community in its ability to operate in Libya
safely and efficiently. To this end he does agree with Abushagur that it is important to replace the
cabinet of former Prime Minister Abdel Rahman el-Keib, particularly Minister of Oil Abdulrahman
Ben Yazza, whose connections to the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi, and the Italian
Oil firm ENI made him unacceptable to the JCP and other conservative parties. That said, this
individual notes that Magariaf was surprised and not pleased with the appointment to the ministry of
Mabrouk Issa Abu Harroura, another technical expert, who previously worked for Libya's Zueitina Oil
Company as well as in the oil sector abroad. Magariaf feels that Abu Harroura does not have the
standing among the foreign oil companies that Ben Yezza enjoyed, although he was more acceptable
to a number of the conservative members of the GNC.

5. Magariaf was pleased that the Prime Minister, after dramatic confrontations with MPs and
demonstrators who entered the GNC chamber, withdrew his cabinet nominations. The President
again advised Abushagur to name former Oil and Finance Minister Ali Tarhouni to the Oil Ministry
post; however, he fears that that Ali Tarhouni is seen as too close to Western governments to gain
acceptance in the GNC. Magariaf is concerned that, while the new cabinet Abushagur plans to put
forward on October 7 may contain some members of the NFA and other moderate groups, it will still
be dominated by the JCP and conservative elements, and will again fail to gain acceptance, leading to
a real government crisis.
6. According to this individual Magariaf and his advisors knew in advance that more than 100
protesters planned to enter the GNC session on October 4, in an effort to prevent MPs from convening
to vote on the new cabinet. While Magariaf did not directly influence these protesters he did nothing
to warn or advise Abushagur on the developing situation. In particular, the protestors objected to the
failure of the Prime Minister to name any minister from the Zawiya region. Although the
demonstrators eventually left the hall, a number of the independent MPs, who had said they would
support the new cabinet, were shaken by the incident and changed their positions. In the end,
according to this individual, Abushagur's efforts to rally their support failed, and he was forced to
withdraw all of the nominees, promising to submit a new list on October 7, one that would take into
account regional and political considerations.
7. In the opinion of a particularly sensitive source, the failure of Abushagur to name any NFA
ministers to the new cabinet will continue to complicate the matter. For his part Magariaf is
concerned over international perceptions regarding the nature of the new Libyan government. In this
regard, he fears that the Western press is too sharply focused on the fact that the NFA holds the
largest single bloc of votes in the GNC (38), missing the fact that the real power in the parliament lies
with the 120 independent deputies, who tend to be somewhat conservative on religious and social
matters, while focusing primarily on local political issues. Magariaf believes that the appointment of
Ali Tarhouni, or another liberal not associated with the NFA, would serve to reassure Western
business and government leaders while demonstrating political balance to the Libyan people.
Although he continues to make this point, the President has no indication that Abushagur will follow
his advice. He does expect Abushagur to again select a majority of cabinet ministers associated with
the MB and the JCP.
8. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Magariaf will remain focused on the security
situation, particularly as he is having some success disarming the militias following the death of the U.S.
Ambassador. According to this individual, Magariaf believes he must end the power of the regional militia

forces before the Libyan economy can improve. The President knows that foreign companies are the key to
Libyan oil production, but he fears that they will not increase their commitment to Libya until the government
can insure the security of their personnel and facilities. In a final note, this individual added that the Italian
government is stepping up its activities in Libya, and the President expects them to pressure to Abushagur
appoint an individual like Ben Yezza to the Oil Ministry, where he can favor ENI and other Italian firms.)

Subject: Q re HbJ
Jake,
The Secretary asked me this afternoon about timing for a call/meeting with Hb1 on the Syrian opposition. I told
her wanted to consult with Robert to double check on this:
Robert agrees that 1-1131 remains quite involved in the Syria issue. For instance, when he was in the London meeting on
the Syria opposition just before UNGA, the Qatari rep got Hill on the phone in minutes during the meeting to weigh in
on a Q re the SNC — and HbJ's view carried the day.
We are now sending to Amb Susan Ziadeh the list of organizations that we want to Qataris to contact inside Syria to ask
them to choose reps to send to Doha. We are also sending her the list of names we are socializing for consideration for
the 'political council" Susan can discuss these lists in Doha on Sunday, so it would make sense for S to wait until
Monday or Tuesday to engage with HbJ on some of these ideas for managing the conference and its outcomes.
Robert confirms that there is a lot of talk about the Doha meeting being postponed for a few days, but there is no new
firm date. We are quite comfortable with a delay as it gives us (and others) time to press for good
representation/participation and a better outcome. The idea of a follow-on conference in Cairo is still very much alive.
She suggested she might also check with Hb1 on whether he is planning a trip here anytime soon. Meeting him in person
would be great if he's planning a trip here.
II send a note up on Monday with some ideas on the Libya meeting that the Secretary asked about.

Re: Bin Laden, AQ & Libya
Latest report:
During the early morning of May 2, 2011 sources with access to the leadership of the Libyan rebellion's ruling Transitional
National Council (TNC) stated in confidence that they are concerned that the death of al Qa'ida leader Osama Bin Laden
will inspire al Qa`ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) to use weapons they have obtained, which were originally intended
for the rebels in Libya, to retaliate against the United States and its allies for this attack in Pakistan. These individuals fear
that the use of the weapons in this manner will complicate the TNC's relationship with NATO and the United States,
whose support is vital to them in their struggle with the forces of Muammar al Qaddafi. In this regard they are concerned
that U.S. officials will believe reports, often created by the Tripoli Government, regarding the degree of influence exercised
by AQIM on the TNC.
These individuals note that the TNC officials are reacting to reports received during the week of April 25 from their own
sources of information, the French General Directorate for External Security (DGSE), and British external intelligence
service (MI-6), stating that AQIM has acquired about 10 SAM 7- Grail/Streela man-portable air-defense systems

or MPADS) from illegal weapons markets in Western Niger and Northern Mali. These weapons were
originally intended for sale to the rebel forces in Libya, but AQIM operatives were able to meet secretly with these arms
dealers and purchase the equipment. The acquisition of these sophisticated weapons creates a serious threat to air traffic
in Southern Morocco, Algeria, Northern Mali, Western Niger, and Eastern Mauritania.
(Source Comment: According to very sensitive sources, the Libyan rebels are concerned that AQIM may also obtain
SPIGOTT wire-guided anti-tank missiles and an unspecified number of Russian anti-tank mines made of plastic and
undetectable by anti-mine equipment. This equipment again was coming through Niger and Mali, and was intended for the
rebels in Libya. They note that AQIM is very strong in this region of Northwest Africa.)
In the opinion of these knowledgeable individuals, Libyan rebel commanders are also concerned that the death of Bin
Laden comes at a time when sensitive information indicates that the leaders of AQIM are planning to launch attacks
across North Africa and Europe in an effort to reassert their relevance during the ongoing upheavals in Libya, as well as
the rest of North Africa and the Middle East. They believe the first stop In this campaign was the April X) bombing of a
cafe in Marrakesh, Morocco that is frequented by Western tourists. These individuals point out that AQIM also maintains
a wide reach in Europe.
The INC leaders are also concerned that, with the death of Salt al-Arab Qaddafi, the youngest son of Muammar Qaddafi,
the Tripoli Government may pursue retaliation against the United States and its Western allies through surrogate terrorist
groups, particularly Herb°Mk While the deaths of Bin Laden and Saif al-Arab are completely unrelated, two separate
and very dangerous groups will now be looking for revenge against the U.S. and its allies.
(Source Comment: These knowledgeable sources believe that the loaders of the INC are also worried about the reaction
to the death of Bin Laden among rebel fighters and their supporters in Libya and Egypt, where the al Qa'ida leader was
very popular. These INC officials do not want the death of Bin Laden to affect their relations with the West or their
support from NATO, the U.S., France, or Great Britain.)

Subject: Rice on "This Week"
Here is Susan on this week. She wasn't asked about whether we had any intel. But she did make clear our
view that this started spontaneously and then evolved. The only troubling sentence relates to the
investigation, specifically: And we'll see when the investigation unfolds whether what was -- what
transpired in Benghazi might have unfolded differently in different circumstances." But she got pushed
there.
Waiting on other transcripts.
For more on what happened and why, let's bring in the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Dr. Susan
Rice. Dr. Rice, thank you for joining us.
RICE: Good to be with you, Jake.
TAPPER: So, first of all, what is the latest you can tell us on who these attackers were at the embassy or at
the consulate in Benghazi? We're hearing that the Libyans have arrested people. They're saying that some
people involved were from outside the country, that there might have even been Al Qaida ties. What's the
latest information?
RICE: Well, Jake, first of all, it's important to know that there's an FBI investigation that has begun and
will take some time to be completed. That will tell us with certainty what transpired.
But our current best assessment, based on the information that we have at present, is that, in fact, what
this began as, it was a spontaneous -- not a premeditated -- response to what had transpired in Cairo. In
Cairo, as you know, a few hours earlier, there was a violent protest that was undertaken in reaction to this
very offensive video that was disseminated.
We believe that folks in Benghazi, a small number of people came to the embassy to -- or to the consulate,
rather, to replicate the sort of challenge that was posed in Cairo. And then as that unfolded, it seems to
have been hijacked, let us say, by some individual clusters of extremists who came with heavier weapons,
weapons that as you know in -- in the wake of the revolution in Libya are -- are quite common and
accessible. And it then evolved from there.

We'll wait to see exactly what the investigation finally confirms, but that's the best information we have at
present.
TAPPER: Why was there such a security breakdown? Why was there not better security at the compound
in Benghazi? Why were there not U.S. Marines at the embassy in Tripoli?
RICE: Well, first of all, we had a substantial security presence with our personnel...
TAPPER: Not substantial enough, though, right?
RICE: ... with our personnel and the consulate in Benghazi. Tragically, two of the four Americans who
were killed were there providing security. That was their function. And indeed, there were many other
colleagues who were doing the same with them.
It obviously didn't prove sufficient to the -- the nature of the attack and sufficient in that -- in that
moment. And that's why, obviously, we have reinforced our remaining presence in Tripoli and why the
president has very -- been very clear that in Libya and throughout the region we are going to call on the
governments, first of all, to assume their responsibilities to protect our facilities and our personnel, and
we're reinforcing our facilities and our -- our embassies where possible...
TAPPER: But why...
RICE: ... and where needed.
TAPPER: Why would we not have Marines at the embassy in Tripoli to begin with? It would seem like this
-- this is obviously an unstable country. This is a region where U.S. interests have been attacked in
previous months. Why were there not Marines there to begin with?
RICE: First of all, there are Marines in some places around the world. There are not Marines in every
facility. That depends on the circumstances. That depends on the requirements. Our presence in Tripoli,
as in Benghazi, is relatively new, as you will recall. We've been back post-revolution only for a matter of
months.
But I've visited there myself, both to Tripoli and Benghazi. I was very grateful to have a strong security
presence with me as part of our -- our embassy detachment there. So we certainly are aware that Libya is a
place where there have been increasingly some violent incidents. The security personnel that the State
Department thought were required were in place. And we'll see when the investigation unfolds whether
what was -- what transpired in Benghazi might have unfolded differently in different circumstances.
But the president has been very clear. The protection of American personnel and facilities is and will
remain our top priority. That's why we've reinforced our presence in Tripoli and elsewhere.

TAPPER: Look at this map, if you would. There have been protests around the world over the last several
days. And President Obama pledged to repair America's relationships with the Muslim world. Why does
the U.S. seem so impotent? And why is the U.S. even less popular today in some of these Muslim and Arab
countries than it was four years ago?
RICE: Jake, we're not impotent. We're not even less popular, to challenge that assessment. I don't know
on what basis you make that judgment. But let me -- let me point...
TAPPER: It just seems that the U.S. government is powerless as this -- as this maelstrom erupts.
RICE: It's actually the opposite. First of all, let's be clear about what transpired here. What happened this
week in Cairo, in Benghazi, in many other parts of the region...
TAPPER: Tunisia, Khartoum...
RICE: ... was a result a direct result of a heinous and offensive video that was widely disseminated, that
the U.S. government had nothing to do with, which we have made clear is reprehensible and disgusting.
We have also been very clear in saying that there is no excuse for violence, there is -- that we have
condemned it in the strongest possible terms.
But let's look at what's happened. It's quite the opposite of being impotent. We have worked with the
governments in Egypt. President Obama picked up the phone and talked to President Morsi in Egypt. And
as soon as he did that, the security provided to our personnel in our embassies dramatically increased.
President Morsi...
TAPPER: It took two days for President Morsi to say anything about this.
RICE: President Morsi has been out repeatedly and said that he condemns this violence. He's called off --
and his people have called off any further demonstrations and have made very clear that this has to stop.
(CROSSTALK)
RICE: Now, and and same, frankly, in Tunisia, in Yemen, and, of course, in Libya, where the
government has -- has gone out of its way to try to step up security and express deepest remorse for what
has happened. We are quite popular in Libya, as you might expect, having been a major partner in their
revolution. What transpired outside of our consulate in Benghazi was not an expression of deep-seated
anti-Americanism on the part of the Libyan people. Quite the contrary. The counter-demonstrations, the
outpouring of sympathy and support for Ambassador Stevens and for the United States, the government
of Libya and -- and the people on the street saying how pained they are by this, is much more a reflection
of the sentiment towards the United States than a small handful of heavily armed mobsters.

TAPPER: That certainly, according to polling, is the case in Libya. Not the case in Egypt. And since you
brought up President Morsi, let me try to get some clarification on something. President Obama was asked
about the relationship with Egypt on Wednesday, and this is what he said.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
OBAMA: I don't think that we would consider them an ally, but we don't consider them an enemy. They
are a new government that is trying to find its way.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
TAPPER: The United States has sent billions of dollars of U.S. taxpayer money to Egypt over the last few
decades. And by definition, as you know, according to the State Department, Egypt is a major non-NATO
ally of the United States. Why would President Obama say Egypt is not an ally?
RICE: Well, first of all, the president has been very clear and -- and everybody understands that Egypt is a
very critical partner of the United States, has long been so. That relationship remains the same, and the
president wasn't signaling any change in -- in the nature...
TAPPER: Was he trying to nudge Morsi?
RICE: The president wasn't signaling any change in the nature of our relationship. Obviously, the
president had a conversation with President Morsi and a very productive one, in which he underscored
that it's, of course, the responsibility of the Egyptian government as host to protect diplomatic personnel
and facilities, including our own, and we saw that President Morsi, immediately after that, took dramatic
steps to improve the security of our facilities in Cairo and elsewhere, and then went out and repeatedly
made a number of very important and powerful statements condemning the violence and conveying the
message that, however hateful such a video may be, there is absolutely no justification for violence against
the United States or other Western partners.
So what we've seen is that the president has been incredibly calm, incredibly steady, and incredibly
measured in his approach to this set of developments. And his interventions, his leadership has ensured
that in Egypt, in Yemen, in Tunisia, in Libya, and many other parts of the world, that leaders have come
out and made very plain that there's no excuse for this violence. We heard Prime Minister Erdogan of
Turkey say the same, we heard the Grand Mufti in Saudi Arabia say the same, that there's no excuse for
violence, that violence is to be condemned, and that governments have a responsibility to protect United
States personnel and facilities and those of all foreign diplomats.
TAPPER: I know you have to go, but very quickly, was the president in that interview trying to nudge
President Morsi, "Get your act together"?

RICE: No. I think that the president communicated directly with -- with President Morsi and had the
opportunity to -- to understand our expectation that Egypt will do what it can to protect our facilities. So
that -- that was conveyed very directly, and the results were immediate and quite satisfactory.
TAPPER: Dr. Rice, thank you so much for coming here today and answering our questions.
RICE: Good to be with you.

Subject: 'Meet the Press' Transcript U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice
Dear Mr. Sullivan,
As per your request, here is the transcript from Ambassador Rice's appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press." We will
forward the transcripts from the other Sunday morning shows as we receive them. Thank you
Announcer: From NBC News in Washington, MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory.
GREGORY: And good morning. Relative calm this morning in the Middle East after several days of
intense anti-American protests raged across many parts of the Islamic world. But word this morning
that the Obama administration has ordered the evacuation of all but emergency personnel from
diplomatic missions in Tunisia and Sudan. And defense secretary Leon Panetta saying this morning,
the Pentagon has deployed forces to several areas in an increased effort to protect U.S. personnel
and property from the potential of violent protests, the latest consequences, of course, of this
troubling unrest. Joining me now for the very latest, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
Susan Rice. Ambassador Rice, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS.
MS. SUSAN RICE (U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations): Thank you, good to be here.
GREGORY: The images as you well know are jarring to Americans watching all of this play out this
week, and we'll share the map of all of this turmoil with our viewers to show the scale of it across not
just the Arab world, but the entire Islamic world and flashpoints as well. In Egypt, of course, the
protests outside the U.S. embassy there that Egyptian officials were slow to put down. This weekend
in Pakistan, protests as well there. More anti-American rage. Also protests against the drone
strikes. In Yemen, you also had arrests and some deaths outside of our U.S. embassy there. How
much longer can Americans expect to see these troubling images and these protests go forward?

MS. RICE: Well, David, we can't predict with any certainty. But let's remember what has transpired
over the last several days. This is a response to a hateful and offensive video that was widely
disseminated throughout the Arab and Muslim world. Obviously, our view is that there is absolutely
no excuse for violence and that-- what has happened is condemnable, but this is a-- a spontaneous
reaction to a video, and it's not dissimilar but, perhaps, on a slightly larger scale than what we have
seen in the past with The Satanic Verses with the cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. Now, the
United States has made very clear and the president has been very plain that our top priority is the
protection of American personnel in our facilities and bringing to justice those who...
GREGORY: All right.
MS. RICE: . attacked our facility in Benghazi.
GREGORY: Well, let's talk— talk about-- well, you talked about this as spontaneous. Can you say
definitively that the attacks on-- on our consulate in Libya that killed ambassador Stevens and others
there security personnel, that was spontaneous, was it a planned attack? Was there a terrorist
element to it?
MS. RICE: Well, let us-- let me tell you the-- the best information we have at present. First of all,
there's an FBI investigation which is ongoing. And we look to that investigation to give us the
definitive word as to what transpired. But putting together the best information that we have available
to us today our current assessment is that what happened in Benghazi was in fact initially a
spontaneous reaction to what had just transpired hours before in Cairo, almost a copycat of-- of the
demonstrations against our facility in Cairo, which were prompted, of course, by the video. What we
think then transpired in Benghazi is that opportunistic extremist elements came to the consulate as
this was unfolding. They came with heavy weapons which unfortunately are readily available in post
revolutionary Libya, And it escalated into a much more violent episode. Obviously, that's-- that's our
best judgment now. We'll await the results of the investigation. And the president has been very
clear--we'll work with the Libyan authorities to bring those responsible to justice.
GREGORY: Was there a failure here that this administration is responsible for, whether it's an
intelligence failure, a failure to see this coming, or a failure to adequately protect U.S. embassies and
installations from a spontaneous kind of reaction like this?
MS. RICE: David, I don't think so. First of all we had no actionable intelligence to suggest that-- that
any attack on our facility in Benghazi was imminent. In Cairo, we did have indications that there was
the risk that the video might spark some-- some protests and our embassy, in fact, acted accordingly,
and had called upon the Egyptian authorities to— to reinforce our fasility. What we have seen as--
with respect to the security response, obviously we had security personnel in Benghazi, a-- a

significant number, and tragically, among those four that were killed were two of our security
personnel. But what happened, obviously, overwhelmed the security we had in place which is why
the president ordered additional reinforcements to Tripoli and— and why elsewhere in the world we
have been working with governments to ensure they take up their obligations to protect us and we
reinforce where necessary.
GREGORY: The president and the secretary of state have talked about a mob mentality. That's my
words, not their words, but they talked about the-- the tyranny of mobs operating in this part of the
world. Here's the reality, if you look at foreign aid--U.S. direct foreign aid to the two countries
involved here, in Libya and Egypt, this is what you'd see: two hundred million since 2011 to Libya,
over a billion a year to Egypt and yet Americans are seeing these kinds of protests and attacks on our
own diplomats. Would-- what do you say to members of congress who are now weighing whether to
suspend our aid to these countries if this is the response that America gets?
MS. RICE: Well, first of all, David, let's put this in perspective. As I said, this is a response to a— a
very offensive video. It's not the first time that American facilities have come under attack in the
Middle East, going back to 1982 in-- in Beirut, going back to the Khobar Towers in-- in Saudi Arabia,
or even the attack on our embassy in 2008 in Yemen.
GREGORY: Or Iran in 1979.
MS. RICE: This has-- this has happened in the past, but there-- and so I don't think that-- that we
should misunderstand what this is. The reason we provide aid in Egypt and in Libya is because it
serves American interests because the relationships...
GREGORY: But-- but our Americans are not being served if this is the response.
MS. RICE: It serves our interests to have Egypt willing and able to-- to maintain its peace treaty with
Israel, it servers our interest for Egypt to continue to be a strong partner. Now, let's be clear, the
government, once President Obama called President Morsi, immediately in Egypt the security forces
came out and have provided very significant protection. Same in Tunisia, same in Libya, same in
Yemen. And all of these leaders have very forcefully conveyed their condemnation of what has
transpired.
GREGORY: But there were conflicting messages from the Morsi government. In Arabic they
encourage protests, in English they said stop the protests. This from an ally that we give over a
billion dollars?

MS. RICE: What has happened in fact is that the Egyptian government has come out and protected
our facilities. Our embassy is open today, things are calm. And Morsi has repeatedly been clear in
his condemnation of-- of what has occurred. We-- we are in these partnerships, David, over the long-
term. We think that-- that-- despite this very bumpy path we're on and the very disturbing images
we've seen, it's in the United States fundamental interest that people have the ability to choose their
own governments, that the governments be democratic and free. That's in our long-term best
interest.
GREGORY: You know that this...
MS. RICE: We need to reinforce that with our assistance.
GREGORY: We are in the middle of a heated presidential campaign, there are different foreign
policy visions. That's why we wanted to dedicate the hour to this today to really understand these
different views. Mitt Romney spoke out this week, he criticized the administration, talked about
whether the United States was apologizing for some of the initial response to this. These were his
comments this week.
(Videotape; Wednesday)
MR. MITT ROMNEY: The administration was wrong to stand by a statement sympathizing with those
who had breached our embassy in Egypt instead of condemning their actions. I think it's a— a-- a
terrible course to-- for America to-- to stand in apology for our values.
(End videotape)
GREGORY: Our embassies did not stand up for speech-- free speech in this initial response to this
violence. And the Republican charge is that it's weakness on the part of this administration that
invites this kind of chaos, that the administration has not been tough enough on radical extremists
that are beginning to take root in these countries. How do you respond to that?
MS. RICE: First of all, I think the American people and certainly our diplomats and-- and
development experts who are putting their lives on the line around the world every day expect from
our leadership unity in times of challenge and strong, steady, steadfast leadership of the sort that
President Obama has been providing. With respect to this, I think, vacuous charge of weakness,
let's-- lets recall, I think, the American people fully understand that this is an administration led by a
president who said when he ran for office that he would take the fight to al Qaeda. We have
decimated al Qaeda. °same bin Laden is dead. He said we would end the war responsibly in
Iraq. We've done that. He has restored relationships around the world. I spend every day up at the
United Nations where I have to interact with 192 other countries. I know how well the United States is

viewed. I know that our standing is much improved and it's translated into important support for
strong American positions, for example with sanctions against Iran.
GREGORY: Was it inappropriate for Governor Romney to level the criticism he leveled?
MS. RICE: I'm not going to get into politics, David. That's not my role in this job. But I think the
American people welcome and appreciate strong, steady, unified leadership, bipartisan in times of
challenge. And for those men and women in our diplomatic service, including those we tragically lost,
they look to our leadership to be unified and responsible.
GREGORY: Let's talk about another area where the administration is on the defensive in terms of
leadership in the world, and that is the nuclear threat from Iran. Another area of tension between the
United States and Israel. In just a couple of minutes we will show our interview with the prime
minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu. And our viewers will see that. One aspect is how close Iran
is getting to becoming a nuclear power. I asked him about that. I want to show you a piece of the
interview and get your reaction to it.
(Videotape)
PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU (Prime Minister of Israel): I can tell you, David, that Iran
has been placed with some clear red lines on a few matters, and they have avoided crossing
them. So I think that as they get closer and closer and closer to the achievement of the weapons-
grade material, and they're very close, they're six months away from being about 90 percent of
having the enriched uranium for an atom bomb, I think that you have to place that red line before
them now, before it's-- it's too late.
GREGORY: As the prime minister of Israel, has Iran crossed your red line?
MR. NETANYAHU: Well, the way I would say it, David, is they are in the red zone. You know, they
are in the last 20 yards. And you can't let them cross that goal line. You can't let them score a
touchdown, because that would have unbelievable consequences, grievous consequences, for the
peace and security of us all-- of the world really.
(End videotape)
GREGORY: What is President Obama's line in the sand, the point at which he says to Iran don't
cross this with your nuclear program or there's going to be a military consequence?

MS. RICE: David, the president has been very, very clear. Our bottom line, if you want to call it a red
line, president's bottom line has been that Iran will not acquire a nuclear weapon and we will take no
option off the table to ensure that it does not acquire a nuclear weapon, including the military option.
GREGORY: The prime minister says_.
MS. RICE: But...
GREGORY: ...they are acquiring.
MS. RICE: ...he's talking about a-- a red zone which is a new concept...
GREGORY: No, no, but he's talking about how close they are to actually becoming a nuclear power--
having to develop a capacity to become a nuclear power.
MS. RICE: They're not there yet. They are not there yet. And our assessment is, and-- and we
share this regularly with our Israeli counterparts in the intelligence and defense community, that there
is time and space for the pressure we are mounting, which is unprecedented in terms of sanctions, to
still yield results. This is not imminent. The window is not infinite, but let's be clear--the sanctions
that-- that are now in place reached their high point in July. The-- the Iranian economy is
suffering. It's shrinking for the first time. Negative one percent growth. The amount of production of
Iranian oil has dropped 40 percent over the last several months. Their currency has plummeted 40
percent over the last several months. This pressure is even to use the Iranian's own words crippling.
GREGORY: But can you say...
MS. RICE: And we think...
GREGORY: ...that President Obama's strategy to keep Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon almost
at the end of his first term is succeeding or failing?
MS. RICE: David, what is clear is Iran does not have a nuclear weapon. And that Iran is more
isolated than ever internationally. The economic pressure it is facing is much greater than
ever. When President Obama came to office the international community was divided about
Iran. And Iran was internally very united. The exact opposite is the case today. The international
community is united. We just had another strong resolution out of the IAEA Board of Governors. And
the internal dynamics in Iran are-- are fracturing and the leadership is divided. We are committed and
President Obama is committed to preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. It is not a policy
of containment. But, David, the most difficult and profound decision that any president has to make is

the decision to go to war. And this president is committed to exhausting pressure, economic
pressure, and diplomacy while there is-- is still time before making a decision of such consequence.
GREGORY: Ambassador Rice, the debate continues. Thank you very much...
MS. RICE: Thank you.
GREGORY: ...for your views this morning.
Now to this looming nuclear threat from Iran from the Israeli perspective. There were new tensions
between the Obama administration in Israel this week. Earlier, I spoke with the prime minister of

outcome of our presidential campaign.

Dear Mr. Sullivan,
As per your request, here is the transcript from Ambassador Rice's appearance on CNN's "State of the Union." We will
forward the transcripts from the other Sunday morning shows as we receive them. Thank you.
CROWLEY: Joining me is the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice.
Madam Ambassador, thank you for joining us.
RICE: Good to be with you, Candy.
CROWLEY: One of the things when I spoke with the Israeli prime minister that struck me was the conviction that he has
that for certain Iran is building on its way to building a nuclear weapon, and his sense of urgency that at this moment
the U.S. needs to set what he calls a "red line" for the U.S.
Does the U.S. share the conviction that Iran is, indeed, building a nuclear weapon? And, B, what about the concept of a
red line?
RICE: Well, Candy, the United States is in constant communication with Israel and Israeli intelligence, Israeli policy
makers, the military. We're sharing our assessments every day. And our assessments, our intelligence assessments are
very similar. Obviously, we share a grave concern about Iran pursuing a nuclear weapon. We are determined to prevent
that from happening. President Obama has been absolutely clear, and on this there's absolutely no daylight between the
United States and Israel that we will do what it takes to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.
We are not at that stage yet. They do not have a nuclear weapon. Our shared intelligence assessments is that there is
still a considerable time and space before they will have a nuclear weapon should they make the decision to go for that.
But we've been very clear. The United States is not interested and is not pursuing a policy of containment. President
Obama has been very plain. We will keep all option on the table, including the military option, as necessary, to prevent
Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.
But, Candy, the fact is we have just seen the imposition of another layer of the toughest sanctions that have ever been
impose Odd a country. In this case, Iran. Their economy is beginning to buckle. Their oil production is down 40 percent.
Their currency has plummeted 40 percent in the last year. Their economy is now shrinking. And this is only going to
intensify.

So we think that there's still considerable time for this pressure to work. But this is not an infinite window. And we've
made very clear that the president's bottom line is Iran will not have a nuclear weapon.
CROWLEY: Let me move you to what's gone on in the Middle East in Arab countries and elsewhere. There is a "New York
Times" story this morning that suggests that the administration thinks this is a foreshadowing of a fall that will see
sustained instability. Does the administration expect to see these sorts of protests outside U.S. embassies and elsewhere
throughout the fall?
RICE: Well, Candy, first of all, let's recall what has happened in the last several days. There was a hateful video that was
disseminated on the Internet. It had nothing to do with the United States government and it's one that we find
disgusting and reprehensible. It's been offensive to many, many people around the world.
That sparked violence in various parts of the world, including violence directed against western facilities including our
embassies and consulates. That violence is absolutely unacceptable, it's not a response that one can ever condone when
it comes to such a video. And we have been working very closely and, indeed, effectively with the governments in the
region and around the world to secure our personnel, secure our embassy, condemn the violent response to this video.
And, frankly, we've seen these sorts of incidents in the past. We've seen violent responses to "Satanic Verses." We've
seen violent responses to the cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed in an evil way. So this is something we've seen
in the past, and we expect that it's possible that these kinds of things could percolate into the future. What we're
focused on is securing our personnel, securing our facilities.
CROWLEY: Do you at this moment feel that U.S. embassies abroad are secure?
RICE: We are doing our utmost to secure our facilities and our personnel and in various vulnerable places. We have
demanded and we are receiving the cooperation of host governments. Host governments have also put out very strong
messages in Libya, in Egypt, in Yemen and Tunisia condemning violence, saying that it's a completely unacceptable
response to such a video. And we feel that we are now in a position doing the maximum that we can to protect our
people.
CROWLEY: Why would one not look at what is going on in the Middle East now and say that the president's outreach to
Muslims, which began at the beginning of his administration in Cairo and elsewhere has not worked because, yes, this
video sparked it, but there is an underlying anti-Americanism that is very evident on the streets. So Why not look at it
and think that this is this outreach has failed?
RICE: For the same reason, Candy, when you look back at history and we had the horrible experience of our facilities and
our personnel being attacked Beirut in 1981, we had the attack on Khobar Towers in the 1990s. We had an attack on our
embassy in Yemen in 2008. There have been such attacks. There have been expressions of hostility towards the west.
CROWLEY: But this was sort of a reset, was it not? It was supposed to be a reset of U.S.-Muslim relations?
RICE: And indeed, in fact, there had been substantial improvements. I have been to Libya and walked the streets of
Benghazi myself. And despite what we saw in that horrific incident where some mob was hijacked ultimately by a
handful of extremists, the United States is extremely popular in Libya and the outpouring of sympathy and support for
Ambassador Stevens and his colleagues from the government, from people is evidence of that.
The fact is, Candy, that this is a turbulent time. It's a time of dramatic change. It's a change that the United States has
backed because we understand that when democracy takes root, when human rights and people's freedom of
expression can be manifested, it may lead to turbulence in the short-term, but over the long-term, that is in the interest
of the United States.
The mobs we've seen on the outside of these embassies are small minority. They're the ones who have largely lost in

these emerging democratic processes, and just as the people of these countries are not going to allow their lives to be
hijacked by a dictator, they're not going to allow an extremist mob to hijack their future and their freedom,. And we're
going to continue to stand with the vast majority of the populations in these countries.
They want freedom. They want a better future. And understand that we're with them in that long-term endeavor.

Re: Q's secret bid to UK
On the morning of June 2, 2011 sensitive sources with access to the advisors to Muammar Qaddafi's son, Saif
al-Islam, stated in strict confidence that the Libyan government has opened extremely complicated negotiations
with the government of the United Kingdom (UK) in an effort to obtain their support in reaching a ceasefire
agreement with the rebels of the Libyan Transitional National Council (TNC), allowing the Qaddafi's to
maintain some level of control in the country.
This initiative is directed by Saif al-Islam and, according to these sensitive sources, the Libyans have asked the
UK officials to broker a deal with the `INC that will allow some form of power sharing, with the possibility of
Saif al-Islam acting as head of state and the TNC members making up a substantial portion of the cabinet in a

new government. Under the plan Muammar Qadde would be allowed to leave the country and go into exile
with no danger of indictment on charges of human rights abuses and corruption by Libyan or international
courts.
(Source Comment: In the opinion of these sensitive sources, this initiative reflects the concern of the Qa.ddafi
government that as a result of continuing NATO air raids against their forces, they can no longer defeat the
rebel army. They add that there has been no firm response from the UK government, and the initial discussions
have been conducted by officers of the British Special Intelligence Service (SIS M1-6). In the opinion of these
same sources the initial idea of these talks may have been raised by former Libyan Foreign Minister Mouse
Kousa, after his arrival in London in late March 2011.)
According to these sensitive sources, Saif al-Islam and his advisors realize that there is little chance the TNC
will agree to such an offer, and that SIS may be using this contact as a means of collecting intelligence while
protecting British interests in Libya. Notwithstanding this concern, in the opinion of these individuals, Saif al-
Islam believes that introducing the possibility of a ceasefire and the subsequent negotiations may create
divisions within NATO and weaken their military operations against Qaddaft's forces.
(Source Comment: These sources add that many of Sail al-Islam's advisors do not know if, or to what extent,
the UK Government has shared knowledge of this initiative with the governments of the United States and the
other NATO allies.)
At the same time, sources with access to the operations of the INC military committee state privately that on
June 1, 2011 Libyan intelligence officers detonated a car bomb outside the Tibesti Hotel in the INC capital of
Benghazi. One person was injured in the blast and a number of nearby vehicles were damaged. INC security
officers occupied the hotel and the surrounding area immediately after the attack, but were not able to identify
any of the attackers. The Tibesti Hotel is an important landmark in the heart of Benghazi and 'is used by the
INC government, as well by foreign journalists and diplomats. Hotel security has been heightened in the hours
following the attack and all foreign residents are under surveillance by INC security officers, looking for
suspicious activities and contacts.

Dear Mr. Sullivan,
As per your request, here is the transcript from Ambassador Rice's appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press." We will
forward the transcripts from the other Sunday morning shows as we receive them. Thank you.
Announcer: From NBC News in Washington, MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory.
GREGORY: And good morning. Relative calm this morning in the Middle East after several days of
intense anti-American protests raged across many parts of the Islamic world. But word this morning
that the Obama administration has ordered the evacuation of all but emergency personnel from
diplomatic missions in Tunisia and Sudan. And defense secretary Leon Panetta saying this morning,
the Pentagon has deployed forces to several areas in an increased effort to protect U.S. personnel
and property from the potential of violent protests, the latest consequences, of course, of this
troubling unrest. Joining me now for the very latest, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
Susan Rice. Ambassador Rice, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS.

MS. SUSAN RICE (U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations): Thank you, good to be here.
GREGORY: The images as you well know are jarring to Americans watching all of this play out this
week, and we'll share the map of all of this turmoil with ourviewers to show the scale of it across not
just the Arab world, but the entire Islamic world and flashpoints as well. In Egypt, of course, the
protests outside the U.S. embassy there that Egyptian officials were slow to put down. This weekend
in Pakistan, protests as well there. More anti-American rage. Also protests against the drone
strikes. In Yemen, you also had arrests and some deaths outside of our U.S. embassy there. How
much longer can Americans expect to see these troubling images and these protests go forward?
MS. RICE: Well, David, we can't predict with any certainty. But let's remember what has transpired
over the last several days. This is a response to a hateful and offensive video that was widely
disseminated throughout the Arab and Muslim world. Obviously, our view is that there is absolutely
no excuse for violence and that— what has happened is condemnable, but this is a-- a spontaneous
reaction to a video, and it's not dissimilar but, perhaps, on a slightly larger scale than what we have
seen in the past with The Satanic Verses with the cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. Now, the
United States has made very clear and the president has been very plain that our top priority is the
protection of American personnel in our facilities and bringing to justice those who...
GREGORY: All right.
MS. RICE: ...attacked our facility in Benghazi.
GREGORY: Well, let's talk-- talk about-- well, you talked about this as spontaneous. Can you say
definitively that the attacks on-- on our consulate in Libya that killed ambassador Stevens and others
there security personnel, that was spontaneous, was it a planned attack? Was there a terrorist
element to it?
MS. RICE: Well, let us-- let me tell you the— the best information we have at present. First of all,
there's an FBI investigation which is ongoing. And we look to that investigation to give us the
definitive word as to what transpired. But putting together the best information that we have available
to us today our current assessment is that what happened in Benghazi was in fact initially a
spontaneous reaction to what had just transpired hours before in Cairo, almost a copycat of-- of the
demonstrations against our facility in Cairo, which were prompted, of course, by the video. What we
think then transpired in Benghazi is that opportunistic extremist elements came to the consulate as
this was unfolding. They came with heavy weapons which unfortunately are readily available in post
revolutionary Libya. And it escalated into a much more violent episode. Obviously, that's-- that's our
best judgment now. We'll await the results of the investigation. And the president has been very
clear--we'll work with the Libyan authorities to bring those responsible to justice.

GREGORY: Was there a failure here that this administration is responsible for, whether it's an
intelligence failure, a failure to see this coming, or a failure to adequately protect U.S. embassies and
installations from a spontaneous kind of reaction like this?
MS. RICE: David, I don't think so. First of all we had no actionable intelligence to suggest that— that
any attack on our facility in Benghazi was imminent. In Cairo, we did have indications that there was
the risk that the video might spark some-- some protests and our embassy, in fact, acted accordingly,
and had called upon the Egyptian authorities to-- to reinforce our facility. What we have seen as--
with respect to the security response, obviously we had security personnel in Benghazi, a-- a
significant number, and tragically, among those four that were killed were two of our security
personnel. But what happened, obviously, overwhelmed the security we had in place which is why
the president ordered additional reinforcements to Tripoli and-- and why elsewhere in the world we
have been working with governments to ensure they take up their obligations to protect us and we
reinforce where necessary
GREGORY: The president and the secretary of state have talked about a mob mentality. That's my
words, not their words, but they talked about the-- the tyranny of mobs operating in this part of the
world. Here's the reality, if you look at foreign aid--U.S. direct foreign aid to the two countries
involved here, in Libya and Egypt, this is what you'd see: two hundred million since 2011 to Libya,
over a billion a year to Egypt and yet Americans are seeing these kinds of protests and attacks on our
own diplomats. Would-- what do you say to members of congress who are now weighing whether to
suspend our aid to these countries if this is the response that America gets?
MS. RICE: Well, first of all, David, let's put this in perspective. As I said, this is a response to a-- a
very offensive video. It's not the first time that American facilities have come under attack in the
Middle East, going back to 1982 in-- in Beirut, going back to the Khobar Towers in-- in Saudi Arabia,
or even the attack on our embassy in 2008 in Yemen.
GREGORY: Or Iran in 1979.
MS. RICE: This has-- this has happened in the past, but there-- and so I don't think that-- that we
should misunderstand what this is. The reason we provide aid in Egypt and in Libya is because it
serves American interests because the relationships...
GREGORY: But-- but our Americans are not being served if this is the response.
MS. RICE: It serves our interests to have Egypt willing and able to-- to maintain its peace treaty with
Israel, it servers our interest for Egypt to continue to be a strong partner. Now, let's be clear, the
government, once President Obama called President Morsi, immediately in Egypt the security forces
came out and have provided very significant protection. Same in Tunisia, same in Libya, same in

Yemen. And all of these leaders have very forcefully conveyed their condemnation of what has
transpired.
GREGORY: But there were conflicting messages from the Morsi government. In Arabic they
encourage protests, lii English they said stop the protests. This from an ally that we give over a
billion dollars?
MS. RICE: What has happened in fact is that the Egyptian government has come out and protected
our facilities. Our embassy is open today, things are calm. And Morsi has repeatedly been clear in
his condemnation of-- of what has occurred. We-- we are in these partnerships, David, over the long-
term. We think that-- that-- despite this very bumpy path we're on and the very disturbing images
we've seen, it's in the United States fundamental interest that people have the ability to choose their
own governments, that the governments be democratic and free. That's in our long-term best
interest.
GREGORY: You know that this...
MS. RICE: We need to reinforce that with our assistance.
GREGORY: We are in the middle of a heated presidential campaign, there are different foreign
policy visions. That's why we wanted to dedicate the hour to this today to really understand these
different views. Mitt Romney spoke out this week, he criticized the administration, talked about
whether the United States was apologizing for some of the initial response to this. These were his
comments this week.
(Videotape; Wednesday)
MR. MITT ROMNEY: The administration was wrong to stand by a statement sympathizing with those
who had breached our embassy in Egypt instead of condemning their actions. I think it's a-- a-- a
terrible course to-- for America to-- to stand in apology for our values.
(End videotape)
GREGORY: Our embassies did not stand up for speech-- free speech in this initial response to this
violence. And the Republican charge is that it's weakness on the part of this administration that
invites this kind of chaos, that the administration has not been tough enough on radical extremists
that are beginning to take root in these countries. How do you respond to that?

MS. RICE: First of all, I think the American people and certainly our diplomats and-- and
development experts who are putting their lives on the line around the world every day expect from
our leadership unity in times of challenge and strong, steady, steadfast leadership of the sort that
President Obama has been providing. With respect to this, I think, vacuous charge of weakness,
let's-- lets recall, I think, the American people fully understand that this is an administration led by a
president who said when he ran for office that he would take the fight to at Qaeda. We have
decimated at Qaeda. Osama bin Laden is dead. He said we would end the war responsibly in
Iraq. We've done that. He has restored relationships around the world. I spend every day up at the
United Nations where I have to interact with 192 other countries. I know how well the United States is
viewed. I know that our standing is much improved and it's translated into important support for
strong American positions, for example with sanctions against Iran.
GREGORY: Was it inappropriate for Governor Romney to level the criticism he leveled?
MS. RICE: I'm not going to get into politics, David. That's not my role in this job. But I think the
American people welcome and appreciate strong, steady, unified leadership, bipartisan in times of
challenge. And for those men and women in our diplomatic service, including those we tragically lost,
they look to our leadership to be unified and responsible.
GREGORY: Let's talk about another area where the administration is on the defensive in terms of
leadership in the world, and that is the nuclear threat from Iran. Another area of tension between the
United States and Israel. In just a couple of minutes we will show our interview with the prime
minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu. And our viewers will see that. One aspect is how close Iran
is getting to becoming a nuclear power. I asked him about that. I want to show you a piece of the
interview and get your reaction to it.
(Videotape)
PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU (Prime Minister of Israel): I can tell you, David, that Iran
has been placed with some clear red lines on a few matters, and they have avoided crossing
them. So I think that as they get closer and closer and closer to the achievement of the weapons-
grade material, and they're very close, they're six months away from being about 90 percent of
having the enriched uranium for an atom bomb, I think that you have to place that red line before
them now, before it's-- it's too late.
GREGORY: As the prime minister of Israel, has Iran crossed your red line?

MR. NETANYAHU: Well, the way I would say it, David, is they are in the red zone. You know, they
are in the last 20 yards. And you can't let them cross that goal line. You can't let them score a
touchdown, because that would have unbelievable consequences, grievous consequences, for the
peace and security of us all-- of the world really.
(End videotape)
GREGORY: What is President Obama's line in the sand, the point at which he says to Iran don't
cross this with your nuclear program or there's going to be a military consequence?
MS. RICE: David, the president has been very, very clear. Our bottom line, if you want to call it a red
line, president's bottom line has been that Iran will not acquire a nuclear weapon and we will take no
option off the table to ensure that it does not acquire a nuclear weapon, including the military option.
GREGORY: The prime minister says...
MS. RICE: But...
GREGORY: ...they are acquiring.
MS. RICE: ...he's talking about a-- a red zone which is a new concept...
GREGORY: No, no, but he's talking about how close they are to actually becoming a nuclear power--
having to develop a capacity to become a nuclear power.
MS. RICE: They're not there yet. They are not there yet. And our assessment is, and-- and we
share this regularly with our Israeli counterparts in the intelligence and defense community, that there
is time and space for the pressure we are mounting, which is unprecedented in terms of sanctions, to
still yield results. This is not imminent. The window is not infinite, but let's be clear--the sanctions
that-- that are now in place reached their high point in July. The-- the Iranian economy is
suffering. It's shrinking for the first time. Negative one percent growth. The amount of production of
Iranian oil has dropped 40 percent over the last several months. Their currency has plummeted 40
percent over the last several months. This pressure is even to use the Iranian's own words crippling.
GREGORY: But can you say...
MS. RICE: And we think...
GREGORY: ...that President Obama's strategy to keep Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon almost
at the end of his first term is succeeding or failing?

MS. RICE: David, what is clear is Iran does not have a nuclear weapon. And that Iran is more
isolated than ever internationally. The economic pressure it is facing is much greater than
ever. When President Obama came to office the international community was divided about
Iran. And Iran was internally very united. The exact opposite is the case today. The international
community is united. We just had another strong resolution out of the IAEA Board of Governors. And
the internal dynamics in Iran are-- are fracturing and the leadership is divided. We are committed and
President Obama is committed to preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. It is not a policy
of containment. But, David, the most difficult and profound decision that any president has to make is
the decision to go to war. And this president is committed to exhausting pressure, economic
pressure, and diplomacy while there is-- is still time before making a decision of such consequence.
GREGORY: Ambassador Rice, the debate continues. Thank you very much...
MS. RICE: Thank you.
GREGORY: ...for your views this morning.
Now to this looming nuclear threat from Iran from the Israeli perspective. There were new tensions
between the Obama administration in Israel this week. Earlier, I spoke with the prime minister of
Israel Benjamin Netanyahu about where things stand and whether he is trying to influence the
outcome of our presidential campaign.

Subject: Les Gelb on the Obama response
The whole thing is worth a read, but a very tough judge gives you and the President credit:
By any standard of reason, President Obama and Secretary of State Canton conducted themselves very well amid the
confusion and crises Of course they didn't do everything perfectly; for example, some unidentified administration official
disowned the embassy statement condemning the video. Such creepiness served only to make it look like Obama was
running for cover at the expense of our embattled diplomats. But minor miscues aside, Obama and Clinton nailed the
main points, especially Clinton. In her first statement soon after the riots, here s what she said The United States
deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back
to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind."

Subject: FW: Benghazi update (1200 local)
Update from Rep. Stevens in Benghazi, based on largely on info from acting PM Ali Tarhouni and acting FM
Salah Bishari:
• TNC caretaker cabinet/members were up until 4am following events in Tripoli and discussing plans for
the coming days. Tarhouni said the TNC has been in constant communication with its people in Tripoli,
including both fighters and those entrusted with implementing the stabilization plans. Rebels in Tripoli,
in coordination with the TNC, have begun to set up checkpoints inside the city and guard public
buildings.
• INC chairman Abd al Jalil and PM Jibril made statements to the media last night, urging people to
refrain from revenge attacks and destruction of public buildings.
• There has so far been "no bloodbath" or serious looting.
• The capture of Saif al-Islam al-Qadhafi and Mohamed al-Qadhafi is significant. The TNC, including
Abd al-Jalil himself, intervened with rebels surrounding Mohamed's house to ensure that they did not
harm him. They understood that it would be harmful to the revolution and the TNC if he were
killed. These events were captured live by Al Jazeera in interviews with Mohamed. Both brothers are
in rebel custody (at this time, it is unclear to us exactly who is holding Clem, however).
• Per Tarhouni, the next steps are: 1) find Muammar Qadhafi; 2) issue a statement announcing the end of
the Qadhafi regime and the start of the interim period under the TNC (TNC staff have begun drafting

this statement already); 3) insure the delivery of essential services and commodities (esp. addressing the
acute shortages of fuel, children's milk, and medication for blood pressure and diabetes); and 4) move
the INC to Tripoli.
• Regarding the move to Tripoli, Tarhouni said security arrangements would need to be made before they
could send the INC leadership to the capital. We have heard from another contact that some TNC
members are already making plans to fly to Misurata and the Western Mountains, possibly as early as
today, and from there drive to Tripoli.
• Request for assistance: Tarhouni, who also holds US citizenship, said the items listed above (gas, diesel,
baby milk, and medicine) are urgently needed in Tripoli and recommended that the IJSG ship those
items directly to Zawiya's Port and publicize such assistance as soon as feasible (in coordination with
the TNC). He said this would bring the US even more goodwill than it has already earned here.

Re: Latest Libyan Leadership Private Discussions & Plans
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. During mid-October 2012 Libyan President Yu.ssef el Magariaf stated in private that he and
Prime Minister Ali Zidan have ordered National Libyan Army (NLA) Chief of Staff General Youssef al
Mangoush to establish a more coordinated operational relationship with Misrata and Zintan militias
in order to support expanded army operations throughout the country. According to a sensitive
source, prior to the death of the United States Ambassador on September 11, 2012 Mangoush resisted
greater reliance on these specific large militias, believing that such a move undercuts the
government's efforts to disarm and demobilize all of the militias left over from the 2011 civil war. At
this point, however, Mangoush agreed with Magariaf that the situation in the country is becoming

increasingly dangerous and unmanageable. Accordingly, the Chief of Staff stated that he will work
with Ousama al Jouwali, the leader of the Zintan forces to step up operations against the other
militias, (supported by the Misrata troops), that also come from the mountainous region of Western
Libya. At the same time he will instruct NLA troops under ground force commander General Khalifa
Belqasim Haftar to pursue operations against tribal forces fighting on behalf of the Qaddafi family in
Southern and Southeastern Libya.
2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Magariaf and Zidan agree that Libya's
future depends on the success of their efforts in this militia demobilization operation over the next six
months. While they believe that the involvement of Ansar al Sharia forces, with the assistance of al
Qati.cla in the Islamic Magreb (AQIM), in the assassination of the U.S, Ambassador has focused the
world business and diplomatic community on the reality of the security issues surrounding the
militias, the President and Prime Minister also fear that the situation is far worse than Western
sources realize. Mangoush informs them that AQIM and radical Salafist groups are increasing their
efforts to take advantage of the frustrations of the various militias with the government, using the
attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi as an inspiration for their activities. Just as Amax al Sharia
began as a militia supporting the federalist claims of Eastern tribal leaders, and was then infiltrated
by AQIM radicals, Mangoush believes many of the other regional and ethnic militias around the
country could follow the same path, if his troops do not succeed in the disarmament program. He
also agrees with Zidan that they must move quickly since Libya's tradition of avoiding the Sunni-Shia
conflict that dominates most of Middle East is beginning to erode during this period of chaos.)
3. A particularly sensitive source noted that NLA operations have already begun against Ansar
al Sharia forces south of Benghazi, after members of that militia/terrorist group killed four national
policemen during a grenade attack at a roadblock in the Sousa Mountains. Under orders from Haftar
Libyan troops surrounded more than 100 Ansar al Sharia fighters in the region of the town of Sousa.
According to this sensitive source, the NLA suffered relatively heavy casualties in the fighting, but
believe they captured a number of AQIM operatives and one of Ansar al Sharia's senior commanders,
Sufian bin Qamu, who they believe ordered the attack on the police. Mangoush also reported to Zidan
that Qamu had been previously captured by United States forces and imprisoned at the Guantanamo
Bay facility.
4. At the same time the Libyan army and forces from the Misrata militia entered the town of
Rani Walid approximately 100 miles south of Tripoli, in an area still loyal to the Qaddafi family,
engaging in close fighting with pro-Qaddafi forces. During the fighting Haftar dispatched troops with
heavier arms to support the Misrata forces. According to this source, the NLA downplayed the level of
the fighting, in an effort to reassure the supporters of the Government. That said the NLA/Misrata
force had captured the city center and the airport after suffering significant casualties. The
Government forces entered the city after shelling opposition positions around the city hospital, using
heavy mortars and motorized guns.
5. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this knowledgeable individual, while Magariaf and
Zidan remain optimistic about the future of Libya, they believe that the security situation will remain
tenuous throughout 2013. Magariaf also sees the national election scheduled for mid-2013 as a
potentially complicating factor. According to this source, Mangoush and Haftar focused on Bani
Walid under pressure from the Misrata commanders. These militia leaders were, according to a
knowledgeable source, angered over the death of one of their senior officials, Oman Shahan, at the
hands of pro-Qaddafi forces in Bani Walid. The Misrata commanders report that Shaban was one of
the organizers of the Misrata militia unit that captured and executed Qaddafi in 2011 outside of the
town of Sirte, The Misrata leaders, supported by the General National Council (CNC), demanded the
surrender of the men who arrested and killed Shahan. As the fighting expanded through late
September and early October, Magariaf and his advisors came to see Bani Walid as an important

Subject: Quick readout from Jeff Feitman in Tried
Jeff asked me to pass along the following readout. Please excuse the free-form list of subjects but I wanted to get this
out quickly to as wide an audience as possible. Please feel free to share with others I've missed.
1. State of Embassy Tripoli facility: While admitting he is no engineer, Jeff agrees with the initial OBO assessment
that the facility is not salvageable — the condition is "shocking and photos doesn't do it justice.' Floors have
collapsed, the ballistic glass and metal support beams have melted, and it has been totally trashed. Jeff asked
for their help on Embassy security; they took this on board but noted that they are still in the process of trying to
secure the country.
2. Abdel JAI and Mahmoud fibril both to NY next week: Both will travel to NY next week for the high level
meeting on the 20th. Jain will then return to Libya, and Jibril will remain in NY to deliver the Libyan address to
UNGA on the 24th. The plan is to have the new cabinet in place by the 2e,with Jibril the likely PM. Jeff pressed
them on including a woman on their UN delegation. He also made all of the points about the need for the INC
to take the lead in NY in outlining what they are seeking from the int'l community but they didn't share their
ideas about what they will say.
Action needed: Jalil needs a visa,
understand MAG is working this now but we will need to facilitate issuance (likely by Embassy Tunis).
1 Saadi Qadhafl and Niger: Jibril has sent a letter to Niamey and is sending the Deputy FM there to talk about
Saadi. The Libyan request to Niger will be two-fold: 1. Detain him properly (they understand he is free to roam
about 2. Be prepared to return him to Libya to stand trial.
4. Weapons issues: They will ask OPCW to come back and they want them to say yes but the Libyans are picking
up noises from OPCW that they can't accept a request from the INC now because the INC is not a UN
member. (comment: I know the credentials issue is being worked this week in NY but Ken Ward please convey
to OPCW that they need to take the Libyans up on their request asap.)
S. OUP mandate: they think NATO should stay beyond an additional 30 days (I told Jeff I thought we were now
looking at 90 in any case).
6. Pan Am 103: Jeff raised the issue with Jaill and the Justice Minister, which they took on board; Justice Minister
said "this was a crime against humanity so Libya has to cooperate."
7. Treatment of Libyans of color and African migrants: Jeff raised and they responded with the right things.
8. Oil fund paper: Passed to INC.
9. "Boots on the ground": they asked about the comments they had seen and expressed their concern over
them. Jeff explained that these were people to help provide security for our people and facility and why they
were necessary.

Re: Libyan leadership and militias
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. During the last week of December 2011, and the first week of 2012, Libya's Prime Minister
Abdurrahim el-Keib and President Mustafa Abdul Jalil engaged in a series of emergency planning
meetings attempting to deal with specific issues threatening the stability of the new National
Transitional Council (NTC) Government. According to extremely sensitive sources speaking in strict
confidence, paramount among these issues are the questions of disarming and rewarding the regional
militias who bore the majority of the fighting against the regime of ivluammar al Qaddafi, as well as
the related issue of finding ministers and senior administrators for the new government who are
acceptable to these revolutionary forces. These individuals noted that on four occasions, beginning on
December 23, 2011, groups or angry militiamen came to el-KeilD's office and demanded better

treatment, a clear message of support for the role of Islamic law, and the removal of former Qaddafi
advisors from the new government.
2, (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib is genuinely concerned
that this situation could spiral out of control and threatens the regime. He also suspects that much of
the unrest is being stirred by General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj and his conservative Islamist
supporters. By staying out of the new government, Belhaj has established a position from which he
can criticize their actions and appointments without concern or control. That said, el — Keib has been
told by his contacts in the Moslem Brotherhood (MB) that even Belhaj has been surprised that the
unrest in the militias has begun to manifest itself in fighting between groups that previously shared
the same goals and operated under Belhaj's loose command. This is particularly true in the case of
the increasingly violent conflicts between the Misrata and Zintan regional militias.)
3. In an effort to address these problems el-Keib is making changes in his new administration,
removing Minister of Economics Taher Sherkaz, who, as a former economic advisor to Qaddafi, was a
particular target of the militiamen. In the opinion of well informed individuals, el-Keib's closest and
most influential advisors are experts with economic backgrounds and experience dealing with
Western firms and governments. The most influential of this group are Minister of Oil Abdulrahman
Ben Yezza, Minister of Finance Hassan Ziglam, National Oil Company chief Mari Berrusien, and Ngeb
Obecia from the Libyan Stock Exchange.
4. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib and Jai are also very
concerned over growing criticism that these technocrats are puppets of various Western governments
and firms. Belhaj and the militiamen appear intent on limiting the influence of these Western
entities, using them as a weapon to weaken the el-Keib regime. This trend is also affecting national
security, where, despite el-Keib's efforts to maintain a balance between the Islamists, regional
commanders, and the national army, a potentially dangerous conflict has arisen over the position of
Chief of Staff of the National Army. El-Kieb, according to this individual, believes that he must settle
this matter in short order to avoid provoking security concerns among foreign allies and businesses
contacts.)
5. According to a knowledgeable individual, in late December 2011e1-Kieb resisted efforts by
General Khalifa Belqasim Haftar to establish himself as the Chief of Staff of the National
Army. Haftar, who lived in the United States for many years and is believed by Belhaj and others to
have a relationship with the U.S. Government, is using his popularity among the officer corps of the
regular NTC army to support his claim to be Chief of Staff. This produced heated protests from
militia leaders and in late December 2011e1-Keib named deputy Minister of Defense Colonel Yussef al-
Mangoush, to be Chief of Staff. In the opinion of one source, this is a problematic choice, since el-
!Leib is replacing the supposedly pro-American Haftar with al-Mangoush who commanded one of
Qaddafi's elite Special Forces units, even after the revolution began. This individual believes that el-
Keib's decision was driven by personal animosity toward Haftar, and the influence of Minister of
Defense Osama al-Juwali. The situation is far from resolved, as Haftar and his supporters,
particularly in the Benghazi garrison, continue to claim that the General is the true Chief of Staff. El-
Keib and al-Juwali are working to reconcile all of the elements in this conflict as quickly as possible,
before the supporters of the two claimants begin fighting. In the meantime, el- Keib has stated in
private that he fully expects Belhaj to attack al-Mangoush, but the Prime Minister believes that the
Colonel is the only officer strong enough to disarm the militias and avoid a civil war.
6. At the same time, a very sensitive source added that el-Keib and Jalil are attempting to
reconcile the fighting between Misrata and Zintan forces in Tripoli by naming Misrata leader Fawzi
Abd Ali as Minister of the Interior and al-Juwali, who was commander of the Zintan militia, as
Minister of Defense. To date, according to this individual, this effort has met with limited success, as
the fighting has continued and the militias are refusing to disarm until their demands regarding living
standards are met.
7. (Source Comment: One very sensitive source noted, that el-Keib is aware of the fact that he
is running out of time to stabilize the situation in Libya. He believes that if he does not disarm the
militias and meet their demands in the next six months there is a good chance of increased fighting

among rival groups that could lead to civil war. In any event, he realizes that the ongoing instability
will cause Western governments, firms, and banks, to hesitate before committing themselves to long
term relationships with Libya. El-Keib believes that Belhaj and his advisors have made the same
judgment, and are waiting to fill any vacuum created by this violence, by establishing a conservative
Islamic Republic.)

Illhave to defer to Gene on this. It's a fascinating read, and some stuff mentioned has already happened (such as the
appointment ofiuwaili as Minister of Defense Juwaili is close to the UAE, incidentally). But I simply do not know the
ins and outs of the new Libyan politics in sufficient detail to give a view as to the accuracy of this report A few bits
seemed off key (e.g, the reference that both the misrata and Zintan Brigades once reported "loosely" to BelHaj I don't
believe is true, since Juwaili and the IJAE supported the latter and Qatar the former).
The comment about Belhaj staying out of govt and thus retain the flexibility to carp and make trouble: Jake, you may
remember that AbZ warned exactly of that danger in that weird mtg Qatar insisted upon on the margins of UNGA.

working to reconcile all of the elements in this conflict as quickly as possible, before the supporters of the two
claimants begin fighting. In the meantime, el-Keib has stated in private that he fully expects Belhaj to attack
al-Mangoush, but the Prime Minister believes that the Colonel is the only officer strong enough to disarm the
militias and avoid a civil war.
6. At the same time, a very sensitive source added that el-Keib and Jalil are attempting to reconcile the
fighting between Misrata and Zintan forces in Tripoli by naming Misrata leader Fa-wzi Abd Ali as Minister of
the Interior and al-Juwali, who was commander of the Zintan militia, as Minister of Defense. To date,
according to this individual, this effort has met with limited success, as the fighting has continued and the
militias are refusing to disarm until their demands regarding living standards are met.
7. (Source Comment: One very sensitive source noted, that el-Keib is aware of the fact that he is
running out of time to stabilize the situation in Libya. He believes that if he does not disarm the militias and
meet their demands in the next six months there is a good chance of increased fighting among rival groups that
could lead to civil war. In any event, he realizes that the ongoing instability will cause Western governments,
firms, and banks, to hesitate before committing themselves to long term relationships with Libya. El-Keib
believes that Belhaj and his advisors have made the same judgment, and are waiting to fill any vacuum created
by this violence, by establishing a conservative Islamic Republic.)

Subject: RE: HRC friend
jeff thanks for reminding me. The Al-Keeb government is clearly facing many crises, the major one being the inability so
far to implement what appeared to be fairly detailed plans by Minister of Interior Fauzi and Minister of Defense Juwaili to
incorporate 25k thuwar each (total 75k) into the security forces, armed forces and into the private sector (jobs, training,
education). the main obstacles appear to be inability to implement plans by any of the GOL ministers so far and lack of
funds although we hope there will be a solution to that soon. Also, none of the militias appears willing to budge without
seeing some proof that others are also willing to do so.
I am not sure about HRC contact ascribing these problems mainly to Bel-Haj, whose star we believed had fallen over the
past several weeks. The Islamists are demanding their share of the political pie like everyone else-no more and no less. I
met with a Libyan contact yesterday who had just met with an Islamist-led militiaman from Zintan. The leader of this group
demanded that women's role be inscribed in the constitution as per Sharia'-if that did not happen this guy threatened to
take up arms again. Sarkis-the new but now deposed Economy Minister is an example of the power of the street and
different voices clamoring for different things. He was a technocrat whom we dealt with in the past but because of the
perception that he was "part of the old regime" he had to go even though al-Keeb regretted the decision since Sarkis was
an able technocrat. So, the bottom line is that the disarming and reintegration of the militias is not going as well as we
would have liked though the Minister of Interior told me on the margins of the PM discussion with DDCI Morrell today that
things on that score were going "well." One positive ray of light is that Tripoli Local Council reps told us today that they
had begun registering thuwar to determine which of the three possible categories they couid stream into. Another
disturbing tmed which may be happening is the emergence of organized crime perhaps fueled by old regime elements
including Snussi and al-Baghdadi. According to MOI sources have expressed real concern about an unholy
alliance of former Qadhafi loyalists, criminals who escaped from prison, and odd assortments of different thuwar. They are
apparently getting money, terrorizing the cities by night and engaging in human trafficking, drugs, gunrunning and alcohol
backed by old regime money. The motivation would be economic and political (creating chaos and undermining
stability). Our Legatt reps will meet with the e the Brits tomorrow to see if we can respond to MOI request for help in
training a team to deal with this possible new and troubling phenomenon. Not sure whether this crime phenomenon is
connected to the murder of my good friend Hugo deSamie, a french businessman who had been involved in deals with
the old regime and was back trying his hand with the new group.
It is not clear whether he will survive given the
intense pressure the PM is coming under from the eastern Obeidi tribes-they want one of theirs in the position as
compensation for the murder of Yusuf Obeidi.
So bottom line, there is ferment and things are not progressing as fast and as far as we would like. But let's not panic yet-
the PM is well-intentioned and the ministers are able people if they can get the means to implement their plans. I told the
PM today that we could help in various areas and that we could be as discrete as need be in light of his formidable
political vulnerabilities. By the way, he may be planning to visit Washington and NY end of January-ealry February period.

Subject: MRC friend
Another friend of HliC's offers the following assessment/report from a source. HRC interested in your views.
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels
of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. During the last is of December 2011, and the first week of 2012, Libya's Prime Minister
Abdurrahim el-Keib and President Mustafa Abdul Jail engaged in a series of emergency planning meetings
attempting to deal with specific issues threatening the stability of the new National Transitional Council (NTC)
Government According to extremely sensitive sources speaking in strict confidence, paramount among these
issues are the questions of disarming and rewarding the regional militias who bore the majority of the fighting
against the regime of Muammar al Qaddafi, as well as the related issue of finding ministers and senior
administrators for the new government who are acceptable to these revolutionary forces. These individuals
noted that on four occasions, beginning on December 23, 2011, groups or angry militiamen came to el-Keib's
office and demanded better treatment, a clear message of support for the role of Islamic law, and the removal
of former Qaddafi advisors from the new government.
2. (Source Comment In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib is genuinely concerned that this
situation could spiral out of control and threatens the regime. He also suspects that much of the unrest is being
stirred by General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj and his conservative Islamist supporters By staying out of the
new government, Belhaj has established a position from which he can criticize their actions and appointments
without concern or control. That said, el — Keib has been told by his contacts in the Moslem Brotherhood (MB)
that even Belhaj has been surprised that the unrest in the militias has begun to manifest itself in fighting
between groups that previously shared the same goals and operated under Belhars loose command. This is
particularly true in the case of the increasingly violent conflicts between the Misrata and Zintan regional
militias.)
3. In an effort to address these problems el-Keib is making changes in his new administration, removing
Minister of Economics Taher Sherkaz, who, as a former economic advisor to Qaddafi, was a particular target of
the militiamen. In the opinion of well informed individuals, el-Keib's closest and most influential advisors are
experts with economic backgrounds and experience dealing with Western firms and governments. The most
influential of this group are Minister of Oil Abdulrahman Ben Yezza, Minister of Finance Hassan Ziglam,
National Oil Company chief Nun Berntsien, and Ngeb Obeda from the Libyan Stock Exchange.
4. (Source Comment In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib and Sall are also very concerned
over growing criticism that these technocrats are puppets of various Western governments and firms. Belhaj
and the militiamen appear intent on limiting the influence of these Western entities, using them as a weapon to
weaken the el-Keib regime. This trend is also affecting national security, where, despite el-Keib's efforts to
maintain a balance between the Islamists, regional commanders, and the national army, a potentially
dangerous conflict has arisen over thc position of Chief of Staff of the National Army. El-Kieb, according to this
individual, believes that he must settle this matter in short order to avoid provoking security concerns among
foreign allies and businesses contacts)
5. According to a knowledgeable individual, in late December 2011e1-Kieb resisted efforts by General
Khalifa Belqasirn Hefter to establish himself as the Chief of Staff of the National Army. Hefter, who lived in the

United States for many years and is believed by Belhaj and others to have a relationship with the U.S.
Government, is using his popularity among the officer corps of the regular NTC army to support his claim to be
Chief of Staff. This produced heated protests from militia leaders and in late December 2011e1-Keib named
deputy Minister of Defense Colonel Yussef al-Mangoush, to be Chief of Staff. In the opinion of one source, this
is a problematic choice, since el-Keib is replacing the supposedly pro-American Halter with al-Mangoush who
commanded one of Qaddafi's elite Special Forces units, even after the revolution began. This individual
believes that el-ICeib's decision was driven by personal animosity toward Haftar, and the influence of Minister
of Defense Oswalt aleluwali. The situation is far from resolved, as Hefter and his supporters, particularly in
the Benghazi garrison, continue to claim that the General is the true Chief of Staff. El-Keib and aleiuwali are
working to reconcile all of the elements in this conflict as quickly as possible, before the supporters of the two
claimants begin fighting. In the meantime, el-IC.eib has stated in private that he fully expects Belhaj to attack
al-Mangoush, but the Prime Minister believes that the Colonel is the only officer strong enough to disarm the
militias and avoid a civil war.
6. At the same time, a very sensitive source added that el-Keib and Jail are attempting to reconcile the
fighting between Misrata and Zintan forces in Tripoli by naming Misrata leader Fawzi Abd Ali as Minister of
the Interior and al4uwali, who was commander of the Zintan militia, as Minister of Defense. To date,
according to this individual, this effort has met with limited success, as the fighting has continued and the

believes that Belhaj and his advisors have made the same judgment, and are waiting to fill any vacuum created
by this violence, by establishing a conservative Islamic Republic.)

Statement on the Attack in Benghazi
September 11, 2012
I condemn in the strongest terms the attack on our mission in Benghazi today. As we work to
secure our personnel and facilities, we have confirmed that one of our State Department officers
was killed. We are heartbroken by this terrible loss. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family
and those who have suffered in this attack.
This evening, I called Libyan President Magariaf to coordinate additional support to protect
Americans in Libya. President Magariaf expressed his condemnation and condolences and
pledged his government's full cooperation.
Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted
on the Internet. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs
of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation.
But let me be clear: There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.
In light of the events of today, the United States government is working with partner countries
around the world to protect our personnel, our missions, and American citizens worldwide.
Statement on the Death of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya
September 12, 2012
It is with profound sadness that I share the news of the death of four American personnel in
Benghazi, Libya yesterday. Among them were United States Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens
and Foreign Service Information Management Officer, Sean Smith. We are still making next of
kin notifications for the other two individuals. Our hearts go out to all their families and
colleagues.
A 21 year veteran of the Foreign Service, Ambassador Stevens died last night from injuries he
sustained in the attack on our office in Benghazi.
I had the privilege of swearing in Chris for his post in Libya only a few months ago. He spoke
eloquently about his passion for service, for diplomacy and for the Libyan people. This
assignment was only the latest in his more than two decades of dedication to advancing closer
ties with the people of the Middle East and North Africa which began as a Peace Corps
Volunteer in Morocco. As the conflict in Libya unfolded, Chris was one of the first Americans
on the ground in Benghazi. He risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to
build the foundation for a new, free nation. He spent every day since helping to finish the work
that he started. Chris was committed to advancing America's values and interests, even when
that meant putting himself in danger.
Sean Smith was a husband and a father of two, who joined the Department ten years ago. Like

Chris, Sean was one of our best. Prior to arriving in Benghazi, he served in Baghdad, Pretoria,
Montreal, and most recently The Hague.
All the Americans we lost in yesterday's attacks made the ultimate sacrifice. We condemn this
vicious and violent attack that took their lives, which they had committed to helping the Libyan
people reach for a better future.
America's diplomats and development experts stand on the front lines every day for our country.
We are honored by the service of each and every one of them.
Remarks on the Deaths of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya
September 12, 2012
Yesterday, our U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya was attacked. Heavily armed militants
assaulted the compound and set fire to our buildings. American and Libyan security personnel
battled the attackers together. Four Americans were killed. They included Sean Smith, a Foreign
Service information management officer, and our Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. We are
still making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals.
This is an attack that should shock the conscience of people of all faiths around the world. We
condemn in the strongest terms this senseless act of violence, and we send our prayers to the
families, friends, and colleagues of those we've lost.
All over the world, every day, America's diplomats and development experts risk their lives in
the service of our country and our values, because they believe that the United States must be a
force for peace and progress in the world, that these aspirations are worth striving and sacrificing
for. Alongside our men and women in uniform, they represent the best traditions of a bold and
generous nation.
In the lobby of this building, the State Department, the names of those who have fallen in the line
of duty are inscribed in marble. Our hearts break over each one. And now, because of this
tragedy, we have new heroes to honor and more friends to mourn.
Chris Stevens fell in love with the Middle East as a young Peace Corps volunteer teaching
English in Morocco. He joined the Foreign Service, learned languages, won friends for America
in distant places, and made other people's hopes his own.
In the early days of the Libyan revolution, I asked Chris to be our envoy to the rebel opposition.
He arrived on a cargo ship in the port of Benghazi and began building our relationships with
Libya's revolutionaries. He risked his life to stop a tyrant, then gave his life trying to help build a
better Libya. The world needs more Chris Stevenses. I spoke with his sister, Ann, this morning,
and told her that he will be remembered as a hero by many nations.

Sean Smith was an Air Force veteran. He spent 10 years as an information management officer
in the State Department, he was posted at The Hague, and was in Libya on a brief temporary
assignment. He was a husband to his wife Heather, with whom I spoke this morning. He was a
father to two young children, Samantha and Nathan. They will grow up being proud of the
service their father gave to our country, service that took him from Pretoria to Baghdad, and
finally to Benghazi.
The mission that drew Chris and Sean and their colleagues to Libya is both noble and necessary,
and we and the people of Libya honor their memory by carrying it forward. This is not easy.
Today, many Americans are asking — indeed, I asked myself— how could this happen? How
could this happen in a country we helped liberate, in a city we helped save from destruction?
This question reflects just how complicated and, at times, how confounding the world can be.
But we must be clear-eyed, even in our grief. This was an attack by a small and savage group —
not the people or Government of Libya. Everywhere Chris and his team went in Libya, in a
country scarred by war and tyranny, they were hailed as friends and partners. And when the
attack came yesterday, Libyans stood and fought to defend our post. Some were wounded.
Libyans carried Chris' body to the hospital, and they helped rescue and lead other Americans to
safety. And last night, when I spoke with the President of Libya, he strongly condemned the
violence and pledged every effort to protect our people and pursue those responsible.
The friendship between our countries, borne out of shared struggle, will not be another casualty
of this attack. A free and stable Libya is still in America's interest and security, and we will not
turn our back on that, nor will we rest until those responsible for these attacks are found and
brought to justice. We are working closely with the Libyan authorities to move swiftly and
surely. We are also working with partners around the world to safeguard other American
embassies, consulates, and citizens.
There will be more time later to reflect, but today, we have work to do. There is no higher
priority than protecting our men and women wherever they serve. We are working to determine
the precise motivations and methods of those who carried out this assault. Some have sought to
justify this vicious behavior, along with the protest that took place at our Embassy in Cairo
yesterday, as a response to inflammatory material posted on the intemet. America's commitment
to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear — there is
no justification for this, none. Violence like this is no way to honor religion or faith. And as long
as there are those who would take innocent life in the name of God, the world will never know a
true and lasting peace.
It is especially difficult that this happened on September I I th. It's an anniversary that means a
great deal to all Americans. Every year on that day, we are reminded that our work is not yet
finished, that the job of putting an end to violent extremism and building a safe and stable world
continues. But September 11th means even more than that. It is a day on which we remember

Statement on the Deaths of Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty in Benghazi, Libya
September 13, 2012
The attack on our diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya on Tuesday claimed the lives of four
Americans. Yesterday, I spoke about two: Ambassador Chris Stevens and Information
Management Officer Sean Smith. Today, we also recognize the two security personnel who died
helping protect their colleagues. Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty were both decorated
military veterans who served our country with honor and distinction. Our thoughts, prayers, and
deepest gratitude are with their families and friends. Our embassies could not carry on our
critical work around the world without the service and sacrifice of brave people like Tyrone and
Glen.
Tyrone's friends and colleagues called him "Rone," and they relied on his courage and skill,
honed over two decades as a Navy SEAL. In uniform, he served multiple tours in Iraq and
Afghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in dangerous posts from
Central America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well as the arm of a warrior,
earning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. All our hearts go out to
Tyrone's wife Dorothy and his three sons, Tyrone Jr., Hunter, and Kai, who was born just a few
months ago.
We also grieve for Glen Doherty, called Bub, and his family: his father Bernard, his mother
Barbara, his brother Gregory, and his sister Kathleen. Glen was also a former Navy SEAL and an
experienced paramedic. And he put his life on the line many times, protecting Americans in Iraq,
Afghanistan, and other hotspots. In the end, he died the way he lived — with selfless honor and
unstinting valor.
We condemn the attack that took the lives of these heroes in the strongest terms, and we are
taking additional steps to safeguard American embassies, consulates, and citizens around the
world. This violence should shock the conscience of people of all faiths and traditions. We
appreciate the statements of support that have poured in from across the region and beyond.

People of conscience and goodwill everywhere must stand together in these difficult days against
violence, hate, and division.

our country and our values. They help make the United States the greatest force for peace,

Remarks at the Opening Plenary of the U.S.-Morocco Strategic Dialogue
September 13, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good morning. Well, let me welcome our friends and colleagues
from Morocco here to the Benjamin Franklin Room on the eighth floor of the State Department
for this very important first session of the U.S.-Morocco Strategic Dialogue. Before I begin to
address the significance of this Strategic Dialogue and the next step in our long relations with
Morocco, I want to say a few words about the events unfolding in the world today.
We are closely watching what is happening in Yemen and elsewhere, and we certainly hope and
expect that there will be steps taken to avoid violence and prevent the escalation of protests into
violence.
I also want to take a moment to address the video circulating on the Internet that has led to these
protests in a number of countries. Let me state very clearly — and I hope it is obvious — that the
United States Government had absolutely nothing to do with this video. We absolutely reject its
content and message. America's commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very
beginning of our nation. And as you know, we are home to people of all religions, many of
whom came to this country seeking the right to exercise their own religion, including, of course,
millions of Muslims. And we have the greatest respect for people of faith.
To us, to me personally, this video is disgusting and reprehensible. It appears to have a deeply
cynical purpose: to denigrate a great religion and to provoke rage. But as I said yesterday, there
is no justification, none at all, for responding to this video with violence, We condemn the
violence that has resulted in the strongest terms, and we greatly appreciate that many Muslims in
the United States and around the world have spoken out on this issue.
Violence, we believe, has no place in religion and is no way to honor religion. Islam, like other
religions, respects the fundamental dignity of human beings, and it is a violation of that
fundamental dignity to wage attacks on innocents. As long as there are those who are willing to
shed blood and take innocent life in the name of religion, the name of God, the world will never
know a true and lasting peace. It is especially wrong for violence to be directed against
diplomatic missions. These are places whose very purpose is peaceful: to promote better
understuiding across countries and cultures. All governments have a responsibility to protect

those spaces and people, because to attack an embassy is to attack the idea that we can work
together to build understanding and a better future.
Now, I know it is hard for some people to understand why the United States cannot or does not
just prevent these kinds of reprehensible videos from ever seeing the light of day. Now, I would
note that in today's world with today's technologies, that is impossible. But even if it were
possible, our country does have a long tradition of free expression which is enshrined in our
Constitution and our law, and we do not stop individual citizens from expressing their views no
matter how distasteful they may be.
There are, of course, different views around the world about the outer limits of free speech and
free expression, but there should be no debate about the simple proposition that violence in
response to speech is not acceptable. We all — whether we are leaders in government, leaders in
civil society or religious leaders — must draw the line at violence. And any responsible leader
should be standing up now and drawing that line.
I wanted to begin with this statement, because, as our Moroccan friends and all of you know, this
has been a difficult week at the State Department. I very much appreciate, Minister, the
condolences your government expressed to our Embassy in Rabat And even though that tragedy
happened far away in Benghazi, we found a reminder of the deep bounds that connect Morocco
to the United States. It was in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco that one of the Americans
we lost this week, Ambassador Chris Stevens, fell in love with the region when he served as a
Peace Corps volunteer there. That experience set him on a decades-long career of service. So in
the memory of fallen friends and colleagues, let us remind ourselves of the many ways in which
riot just our governments but the people of our two nations have worked together to build a better
future.
In many ways, the United States looks to Morocco to be a leader and a model. His Majesty King
Mohammed deserves great credit for the work you've undertaken. In fact, after my visit to Rabat
earlier this year. I told my team: "We need to start a Strategic Dialogue with Morocco." No
country has been a friend of the United States longer than Morocco. You were the first nation to
recognize us back in 1777. But we're not satisfied with simply having a friendship that is
longstanding We want one that is dynamic, growing, looking toward the future. So let me
highlight a few of the areas we should focus on today.
On political reform, we have all seen remarkable changes taking place across North Africa and
the Middle East. I commend Morocco and your government for your efforts to stay ahead of
these changes by holding free and fair elections, empowering the elected parliament, taking other
steps to ensure that the government reflects the will of the people. Today, our political working
group will discuss how the United States can continue to support your efforts to translate
commitments into actions. Because as we all know, democracy, real reform, require that people
themselves feel the changes in their evetyday lives: the courts reformed, the government more

open and transparent, universal human rights of all Moroccans — men and women alike —
respected.
I'm especially pleased by Morocco's commitments to take on the deeply troubling problem of
child marriage. We know that child brides are less likely to get an education, more likely to face
life-threatening problems, particularly around child birth and delivery, which not only
shortchanges them but can even rob them and their communities of their lives and talents. So we
want to encourage the government and civil society to continue their important work together on
this issue.
With regard to the Western Sahara, the United States continues to support efforts to find a
peaceful, sustainable, mutually agreed-upon solution. U.S. policy toward the Western Sahara has
remained consistent for many years. We have made clear that Morocco's autonomy plan is
serious, realistic, and credible, and that it represents a potential approach that could satisfy the
aspirations of the people in the Western Sahara to run their own affairs in peace and dignity. We
continue to support the negotiations carried out by the United Nations and hope parties can work
toward resolution.
With respect to the economy, our second working group will focus on what more can be done to
deliver tangible economic benefits. Morocco's economy is relatively healthy, but you face the
same problem that is now endemic across the world — unemployment is still too high, especially
among young people.
That's why the United States is providing $1.5 million to support an effort to attract foreign
investors, foster local economic development, and combat corruption across the region. And I'm
pleased to announce that later this year we will hold a Morocco business development
conference here in Washington to connect businesses from both countries.
Today, we should discuss ways to build on all of these efforts by increasing bilateral trade, a
particular goal of mine since so much trade from Morocco goes to Europe. I'd like to increase
the amount of trade coming to the United States, and also to improve economic integration
across North Africa, which could greatly benefit Morocco because of Morocco's stability and
Morocco's very strong economic foundation. The greater integration there is, the greater the
benefits for Moroccans.
Third, the attack in Benghazi this week reminds us that security remains a vital issue. Through
our work together on the Global Counterterrorism Task Force, the United States and Morocco
already share crucial information and best practices, and I thank Morocco for hosting a Global
Counterterrorism Task Force workshop on threats in the South Atlantic next month.

We are also collaborating through USAID, the Peace Corps, and other agencies to help provide
Moroccan youth with alternatives to criminal and extremist organizations. And so we are
partnering to help strengthen Morocco's criminal justice system and law enforcement.
There will be a lot to discuss in the meeting today. And let me add, the United States greatly
appreciates the constructive role Morocco is playing on the UN Security Council, especially your
support for the effort to end the violence and bloodshed in Syria and help to usher in a new
democratic future for that country. I commend Morocco for offering to host the next ministerial
meeting of the Friends of the Syrian People, and we look forward to continuing to work closely
together as close partners even after your term on the Security Council has ended.
Finally, our education and cultural ties are reason for much celebration. This year marks the 30th
anniversary of our official program to facilitate academic exchanges and other bonds between us.
There are more than 5,000 Moroccan alumni of these programs. Two are with us today — Dr.
Benjelloun and Dr. Ouaouicha — and we thank them. But among all our work on this front, from
preserving Morocco's historic sites to empowering youth, there's one area I particularly hope we
can focus on today and receive your advice and counsel — namely, interfaith dialogue.
In these tense and turbulent times, it's more important than ever for people of different faiths to
exchange ideas, to build understanding, to promote religious tolerance. It's one of the great
challenges of the 21st century, and it's one that we must address together.
So we have a lot of work to do, Minister, but our friendship runs long and deep, and as the treaty
our nations signed in 1786 says, and I quote, "Trusting in God, it will remain permanent." I'm
confident that we will continue to solve problems and produce results that make our nations
stronger, more peaceful, more secure, more prosperous, and also contribute to doing the same for
the world.
So again, let me welcome you, Minister. It's been a great pleasure for me to get to know you, to
work with you, to be your colleague bilaterally, regionally, and globally, and also welcome your
distinguished delegation.
Thank you. (Applause.)
Remarks at Reception Ntlarking Eid ul-Fitr
September 13, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good evening, and although I am many weeks overdue in saying it:
Eid Mubarak. No matter how belated we are honoring Eid and the end of Ramadan, this is a
cherished tradition here at the State Department. And I would like to thank all of you for being
here, including the many members of the Diplomatic Corps.

Tonight, our gathering is more somber than any of us would like. This comes during sad and
difficult days for the State Department family. We lost four Americans. They were good and
brave men. They were committed to the cause of building a brighter future for the people of
Libya. And we condemn the violence in the strongest terms, the violence against our posts in
Benghazi, in Egypt, and now in Yemen.
The Libyan ambassador is with us tonight, and I want to take a moment to thank him for the
support that his government and the Libyan people have shown to the United States in this
tragedy, particularly the outpouring of feelings of grief and loss because of the killing of our
ambassador.
Ambassador Aujali, would you mind saying a few words?
AMBASSADOR AMU: [redacted]
SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Ambassador. I know that that was a very
personal loss for you, as it was for me. I'm the one who sent Chris to Benghazi during the
revolution to show support and be able to advise our government about what we could do to
bring freedom and democracy and opportunity to the people of Libya.
Religious freedom and religious tolerance are essential to the stability of any nation, any people.
Hatred and violence in the name of religion only poison the well. All people of faith and good
will know that the actions of a small and savage group in Benghazi do not honor religion or God
in any way. Nor do they speak for the more than one billion Muslims around the world, many of
whom have shown an outpouring of support during this time
Unfortunately, however, over the last 24 hours, we have also seen violence spread elsewhere.
Some seek to justify this behavior as a response to inflammatory, despicable material posted on
the intemet. As I said earlier today, the United States rejects both the content and the message of
that video. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of
others. At our meeting earlier today, my colleague, the foreign minister of Morocco, said that all
prophets should be respected because they are all symbols of our humanity, for all humanity.
But both of us were crystal clear in this paramount message: There is never any justification for
violent acts of this kind. And we look to leaders around the world to stand up and speak out
against violence, and to take steps to protect diplomatic missions from attack.
Think about it. When Christians are subject to insults to their faith, and that certainly happens,
we expect them not to resort to violence. When Hindus or Buddhists are subjected to insults to
their faiths, and that also certainly happens, we expect them not to resort to violence. The same
goes for all faiths, including Islam.

When all of us who are people of faith - and I am one — feel the pain of insults, of
misunderstanding, of denigration to what we cherish, we must expect ourselves and others not to
resort to violence, That is a universal standard and expectation, and it is everyone's obligation to
meet that, so that we make no differences, we expect no less of ourselves than we expect of
others, You cannot respond to offensive speech with violence without begetting more violence.
And I so strongly believe that the great religions of the world are stronger than any insults. They
have withstood offense for centuries. Refraining from violence, then, is not a sign of weakness in
one's faith; it is absolutely the opposite, a sign that one's faith is unshakable.
So tonight, we must come together and recommit ourselves to working toward a future marked
by understanding and acceptance rather than distrust, hatred, and fear. We can pledge that
whenever one person speaks out in ignorance and bigotry, ten voices will answer. They will
answer resoundingly against the offense and the insult, answering ignorance with enlightenment,
answering hatred with understanding, answering darkness with light; that if one person commits
a violent act in the name of religion, millions will stand up and condemn it out of strength.
In times like these, it can be easy to despair that some differences are irreconcilable, some
mountains too steep to climb; we will therefore never reach the level of understanding and
peacefulness that we seek, and which I believe the great religions of the world call us to pursue.
But that's not what I believe, and I don't think it's what you believe either here tonight. Part of
what makes our country so special is we keep trying. We keep working. We keep investing in
our future. We keep supporting the next generation, believing that young people can keep us
moving forward in a positive direction.
So tonight I think it's important that we talk not just about that better tomorrow that we all seek,
but also about some of the things — the real, practical, tangible things — that young people are
doing to help shape that better future.
Two years ago in this room, at our Eid reception, we launched a program called Generation
Change to lead a grassroots agenda of positive engagement with Muslim communities. And I
asked the young Muslim leaders in the audience that night to be our unofficial ambassadors, to
help build personal connections, seek out partners in other countries. And I can report to you
tonight they did not disappoint. In a few minutes, you're going to meet some of these young
leaders, each with a powerful story to tell.
The Generation Change network that started in this room now circles the globe. We are building
an international alliance of young people who want to drive change in their own communities.
They act as mentors, spark respectful debates, simply offer words of encouragement when
needed. But most importantly, they inspire others to keep expanding the circle of mutual
understanding and respect, one person at a time.

Even as we work to spread tolerance more broadly, we also are working to deepen our
appreciation for the experiences of others. Our 2012 Hours Against Hate initiative encourages
young people to put themselves in another person's shoes through service projects. So far, young
people from all over the world have pledged thousands of volunteer hours to help people from a
different background, to see them as a fellow human being, not a stereotype, not a caricature, but
another real live person — people who don't look like you, live like you, pray like you, but with
whom we will share this planet. And therefore, we have work to do.
People of faith and conscience are called to be the leaders of tolerance. In my tradition, like all
traditions, we are expected to love one another. And together, we have to translate that into better
understanding and cooperation. I'm particularly pleased that the young people you will hear from
tonight are really setting an example, not only for young people elsewhere in the world but,
frankly, for us who are older as well.
Let me now call to the stage someone who has been a tremendous assistance to me in these
efforts. Farah Pandith is the Department's first Special Representative to Muslim Communities.
And from the beginning, she has made reaching out to young people and civil society her top
priority. Farah will introduce you to three young leaders who I am very proud of
Remarks at the Transfer of Remains Ceremony to Honor Those Lost in Attacks in Benghazi, Libya
September 14, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Chaplain. Mr. President, Mr. Vice President,
Secretary Panetta, Ambassador Rice, Secretary Powell and Mrs. Powell, family members of the
four patriots and heroes we bring home, members of the State Department family, ladies and
gentlemen, today we bring home four Americans who gave their lives for our country and our
values. To the families of our fallen colleagues, I offer our most heartfelt condolences and
deepest gratitude.
Sean Smith joined the State Department after six years in the Air Force. He was respected as an
expert on technology by colleagues in Pretoria, Baghdad, Montreal, and The Hague. He enrolled
in correspondence courses at Penn State and had high hopes for the future. Sean leaves behind a
loving wife Heather, two young children, Samantha and Nathan, and scores of grieving family,
friends, and colleagues. And that's just in this world. Because online in the virtual worlds that
Sean helped create, he is also being mourned by countless competitors, collaborators, and garners
who shared his passion.
Tyrone Woods, known to most as Rone, spent two decades as a Navy SEAL, serving multiple
tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in
dangerous posts from Central America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well
as the arms of a warrior, earning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. Our
hearts go out to Tyrone's wife Dorothy, and his three sons Tyrone, Jr., Hunter, and Kai, born just
a few months ago, along with his grieving faii)ily, friends, and colleagues.

Glen Doherty, who went by Bub, was also a former SEAL and an experienced paramedic. He too
died as he lived, serving his country and protecting his colleagues. Glen deployed to some of the
most dangerous places on Earth, including Iraq and Afghanistan, always putting his life on the
line to safeguard other Americans. Our thoughts and prayers are with Glen's father Bernard, his
mother Barbara, his brother Gregory, his sister Kathleen, and their grieving families, friends, and
colleagues.
I was honored to know Ambassador Chris Stevens. I want to thank his parents and siblings, who
are here today, for sharing Chris with us and with our country. What a wonderful gift you gave
us. Over his distinguished career in the Foreign Service, Chris won friends for the United States
in far-flung places. He made those people's hopes his own. During the revolution in Libya, he
risked his life to help protect the Libyan people from a tyrant, and he gave his life helping them
build a better country.
People loved to work with Chris. And as he rose through the ranks, they loved to work for Chris.
He was known not only for his courage but for his smile — goofy but contagious — for his sense
of fun and that California cool.
In the days since the attack, so many Libyans — including the Ambassador from Libya to the
United States, who is with us today — have expressed their sorrow and solidarity. One young
woman, her head covered and her eyes haunted with sadness, held up a handwritten sign that said
"Thugs and killers don't represent Benghazi nor Islam," The President of the Palestinian
Authority, who worked closely with Chris when he served in Jerusalem, sent me a letter
remembering his energy and integrity, and deploring — and I quote — "an act of ugly terror."
Many others from across the Middle East and North Africa have offered similar sentiments.
This has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We've seen the
heavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We've seen rage
and violence directed at American embassies over an awful interne video that we had nothing to
do with. It is hard for the American people to make sense of that because it is senseless, and it is
totally unacceptable.
The people of Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Tunisia did not trade the tyranny of a dictator for the
tyranny of a mob. Reasonable people and responsible leaders in these countries need to do
everything they can to restore security and hold accountable those behind these violent acts. And
we will, under the President's leadership, keep taking steps to protect our personnel around the
world.
There will be more difficult days ahead, but it is important that we don't lose sight of the
fundamental fact that America must keep leading the world. We owe it to those four men to
continue the long, hard work of diplomacy. I am enormously proud of the men and women of the
State Department. I'm proud of all those across our government, civilian and military alike, who

represent America abroad. They help make the United States the greatest force for peace,
progress, and human dignity the world has ever known. If the last few days teach us anything, let
it be this: That this work and the men and women who risk their lives to do it are at the heart of
what makes America great and good.
So we will wipe away our tears, stiffen our spines, and face the future undaunted. And we will
do it together, protecting and helping one another, just like Sean, Tyrone, Glen, and Chris always
did. May God bless them and grant their families peace and solace, and may God continue to
bless the United States of America.
And now, let me have the great honor of introducing someone who came to the State Department
earlier this week to grieve with us. He well understands and values the work that these men were
doing for our country. The President of the United States.
Remarks With Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations Patricia Espinosa After Their
Meeting
September 18, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And it is such a pleasure for me to
welcome my friend and colleague, Secretary Espinosa, along with a very distinguished
delegation of officials from the Mexican Government for this continuation of consultation at the
highest levels of each of our governments.
Before I turn to the matters discussed today, let me give a brief update on the ongoing U.S.
response to the protests in the Middle East and elsewhere. I'm sure as you know already, we are
taking aggressive steps to protect our staffs in embassies and consulates worldwide. That
includes reviewing our security posture at every post and augmenting it where necessary. And
we are working closely with the Libyan Government in our efforts to bring to justice those who
murdered our four American colleagues in Benghazi.
The FBI is now in Tripoli to join the investigation with Libyan officials, and there is nothing
more important to us than ensuring the safety of our American representatives worldwide. At the
same time, as I have said to State Department employees, the incidents of the past week highlight
how important our work is. The United States must and will remain strongly engaged in the
world. Our men and women risk their lives in service to our country and our values, because they
know that the United States must be a force for peace and progress. That is worth striving and
sacrificing for, and nothing that happened last week changes this fundamental fact.
Now, turning to our friends and partners in Mexico, we are always pleased to have a chance to
discuss matters of mutual interest and concern between us. Mexico is one of our closest friends
as well as partner on dozens of critical issues. So we talk about every kind of issue you can
imagine, from education and healthcare to poverty alleviation to the environment. But today, we
focused on a top priority for us both a security.

We just co-chaired the fourth meeting of the U.S.-Mexico Merida High-Level Consultative
Group. This is the last one we will hold during the Calderon Administration. And I want to offer
my personal appreciation to President Calderon and to Foreign Secretary Espinosa for their
leadership and commitment to this partnership and to all on both sides of the border in our
governments who have been deeply engaged and committed to it. The Merida Initiative
represents an unprecedented level of security cooperation between Mexico and the United States.
As our countries continue to deal with the serious challenge of transnational criminal
organizations, including drug traffickers, illegal arms traffickers, money launderers, and violent
gangs that threaten people on both sides of the border, we well know there is no quick and easy
way to stop these criminals and bring them to justice. But nevertheless, during the past now
nearly four years, our countries have collaborated to an extraordinary and unprecedented degree.
We have brought together policy makers and experts from across our governments and societies
who have worked hand in hand to keep our people safe. And I think the habits of cooperation we
have built are among our most important achievements, and we will rely on them for a long time
to come.
Today, our delegations reviewed the gains we've made on key priorities, including improving
law enforcement coordination, reducing the demand for drugs, modernizing our border
infrastructure, strengthening the rule of law, and building more resilient and empowered
communities. We also discussed the lessons we've learned and the work that lies ahead in these
and other areas, which our joint statement will reflect. I want to underscore how important our
security relationship with Mexico is to the United States.
The Government of Mexico and the Mexican people have faced the threat posed by these
criminals with courage and resolve, and we remain committed to doing everything we can to
support Mexico as it continues to work to bring those criminals to justice. This is a transnational
problem, and it calls for a transnational solution, and the United States believes this is a matter of
shared responsibility. That was the first message I brought as Secretary of State when I came to
Mexico, and it continues to be the hallmark of our efforts together. Making sure our people are
safe and our neighbors are safe is of the utmost importance to us.
Now, our two countries share many other priorities, and one of them, empowering women and
girls, was also addressed today. We took the opportunity, the Foreign Secretary and I, to sign a
Memorandum of Understanding between our countries to work together to advance gender
equality, empower girls and women, promote their human rights, and enhance their security.
So again, Secretary Espinosa, let me thank you for years of work and effort, for our productive
conversations in many places around the world and again today, and for being such a valuable
colleague and partner. The United States deeply, deeply values our relationship with Mexico and
the ties of family and friendship that connect so many millions of our people.

And we look forward to the future. We believe strongly that presidential administrations may
change, elections will come and go, but we have established a firm foundation for cooperation
that has already benefited both our countries and which will continue to benefit both of our
countries for many years ahead. So thank you very much.

QUESTION: Madam Secretary, thanks for your time. Are you any closer to finding who killed
Ambassador Chris Stevens?, Libya's President says this attack was planned for months. Are you
confident he's wrong and that security measures were appropriate? And will you leave justice to
the Libyans?
SECRETARY CLINTON: As I said at the outset, we are taking aggressive steps to protect our
people and our consulates and embassies around the world. We are reviewing our security
posture at every post and working with host governments to be sure they know what our security-
needs are wherever necessary. We are also working closely with the Libyan Government to bring
the perpetrators to justice so that we can be assured that we have found who murdered our four,
colleagues and under what circumstances. As I said, the FBI has joined the investigation inside
Libya, and we will not rest until the people who orchestrated this attack are found and punished.
It is also important to look at this strategically and understand what is going on across the region.
In a number of places where protests have tuned violent, we are seeing the hand of extremists
who are trying to exploit people's inflamed passions for their own agendas. But overwhelmingly,
we have found that the people of Egypt, of Libya, of Yemen and Tunisia are not prepared to
trade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob. They want to turn their attention to the
future to provide better opportunities for themselves and their children, and they want a strong
partnership with the United States and the American people based on mutual interests and mutual
respect.
This is part of a larger debate that is going on inside these societies. In Libya, for example, in
their first free elections, moderates were successful at the polls. But look, there are extremists in
all of these societies and on the outside who are working to take advantage of broad outrage in
order to incite violence and specifically incite violence against Americans and American
facilities.
And as I have said to many of the leaders I have spoken to over the past week, these extremist
efforts are a threat to the people of the societies and the governments of those societies as well as
to the region and the United States. And I think it's important at this moment for leaders to put
themselves on the right side of this debate - to speak out clearly and unequivocally against
violence, whoever incites it or conducts it
And in a struggle like this, there can be no doubt where the United States must stand. We support
those who are fighting for the same values and rights that we believe in - in democracy, in

freedom, in universal rights for men and women, for justice and accountability. And I want to
underscore that the United States will continue to work with partners and allies in the region and
around the world to help bring security to these nations so that the promise of the revolutions that
they experienced can be realized.
And finally, on your specific point about Benghazi, we obviously never talk publicly about
security at any of our missions for obvious reasons. But that said, let me assure you that our
security in Benghazi included a unit of host government security forces, as well as a local guard
force of the kind that we rely on in many places around the world. In addition to the security
outside the compound, we relied on a wall and a robust security presence inside the compound.
And with all of our missions overseas, in advance of September lid', as is done every year, we
did an evaluation on threat streams. And the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has
said we had no actionable intelligence that an attack on our post in Benghazi was planned or
imminent.
But let me state the obvious again. Our diplomats engage in dangerous work, and it's the nature
of diplomacy in fragile societies and conflict zones to be aware of the necessity for security but
to also continue the important diplomatic work that has to go on. There is risk inherent in what
we do and what these brave men and women representing the United States are up against every
single day, and we do our very best to limit that risk by ensuring that our security protocols
reflect the environments in which diplomats work and the threats that they are presented with.
Thank you.
Remarks With Indonesian Foreign Minister Raden Mohammad Marty Muliana
Natalegawa After Their Meeting
September 20, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And it's such a pleasure, as always, to
welcome the Indonesian Foreign Minister, and I believe the largest delegation that has ever come
from Indonesia, for the purpose of our third meeting of the U.S.-Indonesia Joint Commission.
This commission is the result of a vision by our two presidents for a comprehensive partnership,
and the agreement to that effect was signed in 2010. Thanks to this partnership, the United States
and Indonesia are working more closely than ever on a range of issues from global security to
clean energy and climate to regional trade and commerce.
And today, Marty and I had the chance to take stock of where our teams have come in the time
of the last year, because we liad our meeting in Bali a year ago. And I must say, I was very
impressed. We covered a great deal today.

But before I start, I'd like to say a few words about the protests in several countries around the
world. We have condemned in the strongest possible terms the violence that has erupted from
these protests. And as I have said, the video that sparked these protests is disgusting and
reprehensible, and the United States Government, of course, had absolutely nothing to do with it.
But there is no justification for violence, and I want to thank the Foreign Minister and his
government for speaking out against violence. We have to look to reasonable people and
responsible leaders everywhere to stand up to extremists who would seek to take advantage of
this moment to commit violent acts against embassies and their fellow countrymen.
Today's meetings have highlighted the strong foundation that we have built together. And one of
our most important concerns is promoting peace and stability in the Asia Pacific. Today, I'm
announcing that the Obama Administration has informed Congress of the potential sale of eight
AH-64D Apache Longbow helicopters to the Indonesian Government. This agreement will
strengthen our comprehensive partnership and help enhance security across the region.
On growth and prosperity, we are increasing our trade relationship that topped $26 billion last
year. Investments in transportation, energy, and infrastructure are creating jobs and supporting
economic growth in both countries. For example, the deal between Lion Air and Boeing alone
represents $21 billion in trade over the next decade. Indonesia's Government has announced half
a trillion dollars in infrastructure improvements, and we recently signed a memorandum of
understanding to make it easier for American companies to bid on these projects.
And yesterday, we signed an agreement for implementing our Millennium Challenge
Corporation Compact with Indonesia. Over the next five years, the United States will invest $600
million in clean energy development, child health and nutrition programs, and efforts to help
make Indonesia's Government more transparent and open.
The United States is also looking forward to Indonesia hosting APEC in 2013, and we are
confident that Indonesia will come to this role with a commitment to promote greater economic
integration across the Asia Pacific.
Both the Foreign Minister and I believe that strong education is essential to compete in a modem
global economy. That's why the United States has expanded the Fulbright Program and
supported partnerships between dozens of American and Indonesian universities. Academic
exchanges between our countries are up and applications from Indonesian students to visit the
United States have increased by one third. USAID has recently expanded its basic education
program to provide $83 million for teacher training and literacy programs for young children.
And we're providing $20 in scholarship funding for Indonesian graduate students.

I also thanked the Minister for Indonesia's leadership in ASEAN. The Foreign Minister's
personal leadership has helped lay the groundwork for diplomacy between ASEAN and China as
it relates to the South China Sea. And we continue to support ASEAN's six-point principles,
which we believe will help reduce tensions and pave the way for a comprehensive code of
conduct for addressing disputes without threats, coercion, or use of force.
Finally. Indonesia and the United States have stood together on a range of global challenges,
from democratic reform in Burma to combating climate change, to working to end the violence
in Syria. We are also coordinating efforts to further develop south-south and triangular
cooperation, such as enhancing disaster preparedness in Burma and convening a conference on
women's empowerment.
We believe that as the second and third-largest democracies in the world, the United States and
Indonesia have a special responsibility to promote democracy and human rights. And for the last
four years, Indonesia has hosted the Bali Democracy Forum to promote peaceful, democratic
transitions through example and open dialogue. Last year, more than 80 countries attended. And
once again, the United States will be sending a high-level delegation.
So, Minister, thank you for everything. Thank you for the great partnership we've had between
us and between our countries.
MS. NULAND: We'll take two questions today, we'll start with Ros Jordan of Al Jazeera
English.
QUESTION: Thank you, Madam Secretary, Mr. Foreign Minister. Madam Secretary, my
question is about the ongoing investigation into last week's attack at the consulate in Benghazi.
You are meeting this afternoon with members of Congress to discuss the progress and the
concerns that they understandably have. First, there is the federal mandate to establish an
accountability review board. Have you done so? Who would you like to see chair it? Are there
certain questions that you desperately want to have answered in order to safeguard the safety of
Foreign Service Officers around the world?
And related to this, given the political instability and the successes of the past year and a half, are
you satisfied that in light of those political changes, enough was done to protect those working in
the Middle East and North Africa? And then finally — and this is perhaps going into the area of
rumor and speculation — but there is at least one report suggesting that Ambassador Stevens felt
that he was on a, quote, "al-Qaida hit list" Is this a scurrilous rumor? Is this gallows humor
when one is working in a period of difficulty and great challenge, or is there something more to
what he allegedly — and I stress that word — said?

SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, first, let me say I'm looking forward to the opportunity to go
up to the Congress today. I will be briefing in two separate sessions, the House and the Senate, in
a classified setting, along with my interagency colleagues, as we continue to work together, and
with governments around the world, to ensure that our people and our facilities are safe. I will be
joined today by the Director of National Intelligence, General Clapper, by the Deputy Secretary
of Defense, Ash Carter, by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Sandy Winnefeld,
along with experts from the FBI, the State Department, and elsewhere in the government.
Now, I anticipate that this briefing will cover our security posture before and during the events,
and the steps we have taken since to do everything we can with host governments to protect our
people and our embassies and consulates. The Director of National Intelligence will speak to the
intelligence issues surrounding these events in Libya. Deputy Secretary Carter will brief on the
superb support we have had from the U.S. military in the wake of these events, and we are at the
very early stages of an FBI investigation. The team from the FBI reached Libya earlier this week.
And I will advise Congress also that I am launching an accountability review board that will be
chaired by Ambassador Thomas Pickering.
I will also talk about the importance of the broader relationships with these countries in light of
the events of the past days. There are obviously very real challenges in these new democracies,
these fragile societies, but as I said last week, the vast majority of the people in these countries
did not throw off the tyranny of a dictator to trade it for the tyranny of a mob. And we are
concerned first and foremost with our own people and facilities, but we are concerned about the
internal security in these countries because ultimately, that puts at risk the men, women, and
children of these societies on a daily ongoing basis if actions are not taken to try to restore
security and civil order.
And let me just conclude by saying that there can be no doubt where the United States stands.
We continue to support those who are fighting for universal values — values that we see at work
in Indonesia — the third largest democracy in the world. We believe that these values of universal
rights, of justice and accountability, of democracy, are there for every person regardless of where
that person might live. So I will look forward to having a chance to talk with members of
Congress.
As to your final question, I have absolutely no information or reason to believe that there's any
basis for that.
QUESTION: Thank you.
MS. NULAND: Last question. Victoria Sidjabat from Tempo Magazine, please.
QUESTION: Yes. Madam, thank you. My question is: Starting today, U.S. Embassy and
Consulate are closed in Indonesia as the Muslim movie become wild fireball, which could be

designed as a weapon to attack U.S. by raising sentiment anti-U.S. from the countries which has
Muslim majority population like Indonesia.
Madam Clinton, how do you see this threat as on the long run? If it's continuing happen, it's —
obviously could give impact to the implementation of (inaudible) program in Indonesia. What is
the reason U.S. Government closed the Embassy and Consulate in Indonesia? What is your
expectation from Indonesia Government, for my Minister Marty Natalegawa? How Indonesia
Government respond to the closing of this Embassy and Consulate, it's starting today? Is U.S. —
Indonesia Government has capability to protect U.S. Embassy and Consulate. So the (inaudible)
program implemented — could be implemented successfully in Indonesia. Thank you.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, let me begin by saying how grateful we are for the excellent
cooperation we have received from the Government of Indonesia, and in particular, from the law
enforcement and security institutions in Indonesia. We are very grateful for not only the
cooperation and protection that has been provided to our facilities, but also to the strong
statements condemning violence from the President, the Foreign Mihister, and others.
In consultation with the Government of Indonesia, we have temporarily, for tomorrow, closed
our facilities. We want to be sure that law enforcement in Indonesia has the ability to do what it
needs to do to make sure that there is no disruption of civil order and security. So we are
cooperating completely, and we're very grateful for the strong leadership provided by Indonesia.
FOREIGN MINISTER NATALEGAWA: Hello, (inaudible), if I may just also respond.
Precisely as the Secretary had said, the decision by the United States Government to close
temporarily its embassies and consulates tomorrow in Indonesia is a decision that's been made
based on communication and conversation between the authorities in Indonesia and the United
States as well. So in other words, it is an informed decision, a decision that is not intended to
show any unfriendly intent on the part of anyone, but it is what it is, and it's quite some — it's the
kind of step that governments actually carry out when situations requires it, even in our case.
Some of our embassies abroad, when the situation requires us to have a temporary closing of the
embassy, we do that as well. So it is something that is quite regular and something that is
actually coordinated as well.
But if I may just broaden the subject matter, I think as our President had said in the past,
Indonesian Government the Indonesian people, even, obviously cannot and would not condone
the — any acts of violence against diplomatic premises, against diplomatic personnel, because
that is, truly — would be a challenge to the efficient and a proper conduct of relations among
states. So that's our point of departure.
At the same time, of course, beyond the immediate issue of protection of the embassies, we have
still ahead of us the challenge of how to prevent the kind of situations where we are now at in

terms of the kind of incendiary and the kind of statements or, in this instance, films that cause —
that is now we have all deplored and condemned for these kind of activities not to be repeated.
So we have a lot of homework to work towards in the future as well.

Remarks With Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar Before Their Meeting
September 21, 2012
Good afternoon, and let me begin by welcoming Foreign Minister Khar on her first visit to
Washington as foreign minister. We've had the opportunity to meet in Islamabad and other
settings, but I am very pleased that we would have this chance to exchange views on our bilateral
relationship as well as regional and global issues.
I want to begin by addressing the events of the day and the past week. Today, we've once again
seen protests in several cities in Pakistan. Unfortunately, some of those protests have turned
violent and, sadly, resulted in loss of life. I want to thank the Government of Pakistan for their
efforts to protect our Embassy in Islamabad and consulates in Lahore, Peshawar, and Karachi.
And I want to be clear, as I have said on numerous occasions, the violence we have seen cannot
be tolerated. There is no justification for violence. Of course, there is provocation, and we have
certainly made clear that we do not in any way support provocation. We found the video that's at
the core of this series of events offensive, disgusting, reprehensible.
But that does not provide justification for violence, and therefore it is important for responsible
leaders, indeed responsible people everywhere, to stand up and speak out against violence and
particularly against those who would exploit this difficult moment to advance their own
extremist ideologies.
Yesterday afternoon when I briefed the Congress, I made it clear that keeping our people
everywhere in the world safe is our top priority. What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist
attack, and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who
murdered four Americans. And we are taking aggressive measures at all of our posts to protect
our staffs and their families along with locally employed people who provide so many important
contributions to the work of our missions.
The Foreign Minister and I will have a chance to cover a full range of subjects today, and it is no
secret that the past year and a half has been challenging for Pakistan and the United States. And
we still have work to do to get our bilateral relationship to the point where we would like it to be,
but we both recognize that we can achieve more when we work together on a focused agenda. So

today is the latest in a series of high-level meetings. Ambassador Marc Grossman has just
returned from consultations in Islamabad. I look forward to seeing President Zardari next week
at the UN General Assembly. At each meeting, we are working to identify the strategic goals we
share — and there are many — and the concrete actions we can each take to accomplish them.
Our number one shared priority remains pursuing our joint counterterrorism objectives to ensure
the security of American and Pakistani citizens alike. We face a common threat from a common
enemy, and we must confront terrorism and extremism together. Earlier this month, I designated
the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization so we could make full use of every
available legal authority to end their deadly attacks. Pakistan's parliament has called for
expelling foreign fighters so that Pakistan's territory can be fully under control of the Pakistani
Government and cannot be used to launch attacks against other nations.
And the follow-through on this is challenging but necessary, and we look forward to working
with Pakistan as they continue to address these problems. We have both pledged to support a
secure, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan, which is vital for the security of the region. And I
want to thank Foreign Minister Khar for Pakistan's reopening of the NATO supply lines to allow
the movement of goods to Afghanistan.
We will discuss the successful first meeting of the Safe Passage Working Group in Islamabad
which brought together Afghan, Pakistani, and U.S. representatives to advance the peace process
in Afghanistan. The Pakistani Government's public call for insurgents to come forward and talk
with the Afghan Government was particularly important. We are ready to work together to build
on these steps, and we will continue our discussions through bilateral consultations and the U.S.-
Afghanistan-Pakistan Core Group.
Now, of course, our relationship goes far beyond our shared security concerns, and today we will
discuss the many other ways in which we work together, particularly to create economic
opportunity for Pakistanis. Foreign Minister Khar and I agree that we need to shift our economic
relationship from aid to trade and investment. We are working to help Pakistan attract more
private sector investment. We hope to finalize a bilateral investment treaty soon. And we've
created a Pakistan private investment initiative to help more of Pakistan's small and medium
sized companies get access to capital.
Over the past few years, we have seen Pakistan's civilian government begin to put down stronger
roots. And if elections proceed as planned next year, it will mark the first time in Pakistan's
history that a civilian-led government has served its full term. The United States supports
Pakistan's economic development, and we have said many times that we want to see democracy
succeed in Pakistan.

We also support Pakistan's sovereignty, but we are clear that all sovereign nations carry certain
obligations to protect the human rights of their citizens, to control their territory, to prevent
threats to their neighbors and the international community.
So we know that there is still much to be done, but I can assure the people of Pakistan that the
United States remains committed to this important relationship and we are confident we can
continue to move forward together one step at a time to reach our shared strategic objectives.
Thank you very much.
Remarks With Tunisian Foreign Minister Rank Abdessalem Before Their Meeting
September 21, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good morning. I am pleased to welcome the Foreign Minister from
Tunisia I'm looking forward to our meeting, We obviously have a great deal to discuss, and I
want to thank the Foreign Minister and the Government of Tunisia for their efforts over the last
week to help secure our Embassy and the American Cooperative School of Tunis following the
violent assaults of last Friday.
We are monitoring events closely today. There is no higher priority for President Obama and
myself than the safety of our people. We've taken a number of steps around the world to
augment security and to protect our personnel at diplomatic posts. And we are working closely
with host governments in this effort.
As I have said before and as is embodied in the Vienna Convention and other international
agreements, all governments have the duty, the solemn duty, to defend diplomatic missions.
They must be safe and protected places so that governments can exchange views and work on
many important issues, and leaders across the world must stand up and be counted in rejecting
violence and holding violent actors accountable.
We are working closely with the Government of Tunisia They have assisted us in enhancing the
security of our facilities. We've also discussed with them the imperative of bringing to justice
those responsible for these violent attacks. And we have offered and will continue to look for
ways that we can assist the new Government of Tunisia in ensuring the rule of law throughout
their country, first and foremost for the people of Tunisia themselves. We look forward to
continuing to build our hew partnership with the Tunisian Government and people. Our
relationship is built around the shared principles of all democracies — a commitment to
nonviolence, to tolerance, and inclusivity for all people, and to upholding the rule of law.
The Tunisian people have bravely put themselves on the road to democracy. They were the first
of the Arab revolutions and they have made important progress in a very short period of time.
They have worked too hard and sacrificed too much over too many years to see their progress

Tunisia but in too many places around the world, look for opportunities to exploit this current
situation or other situations, and all people and leaders must stand against them.
So as the Tunisian Government takes steps to strengthen security and protect the Tunisian people
and economy from extremism and violent agendas, the United States stands ready to help. We
also are working closely with Tunisia on the broader shared threat of terrorism, including from
groups like al-Qaida and its affiliates.
So Minister, please know the United States remains committed to supporting Tunisia as you deal
with this current situation, as you continue your democratic transition, and we want to be with
you as you confront challenges and help seize opportunities together for the betterment of the
future of Tunisia.

Re: Libya internal strife
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of
European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. On the evening of January 22, 2012, according to an official with access to the leadership of the National
Transitional Government (NTC), Libyan President Mustafa Abdul Jalil spoke at length with Prime Minister Abdurrahim el-
Keib, stating in a heated exchange that el-Keib's government must take the steps necessary to address the complaints of
the demobilized fighters from the 2011revolution. Jalil pointed out that the new government has been discussing this
situation since it was formed in October 2011, and matters have now reached a crisis point with a group of more than
2,000 disgruntled veterans, supported by students, attacking the NTC offices in Benghazi on January 21, destroying
computer equipment and NTC files. These demonstrators, some of whom threw Molotov cocktails at the NTC
headquarters building, continue to demand better medical care, jobs, payment for their time in the revolutionary army, and
a commitment to transparency on the part of the el-Keib regime; particularly the appointment of cabinet members arid
senior officials.
2. According to this source, when el-Keib replied, pointing out that demonstrators were camped outside of his
office in Tripoli. He added that the government had to proceed in a measured and professional manner, Jalil stated in
angry tones, that NTC Staffers were beaten and could have been killed during the January 21 incident, pointing out that
this is how the rebellion against Muammar al Qaddafi began in February 2011. Jalil also warned that Islamist leader
General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj and his supporters, particularly militia commanders from Zintan, Misrata, and other

western regions, are anxiously waiting for the NTC government to collapse. Their goal, in the opinion of this individual, is
to eventually move in and establish a strict Islamic state. Jalil, added that his contacts in the Egyptian Muslim
Brotherhood had been in touch during the preceding week, warning that the threat from Belhaj is very real. El-Keib stated
that he must press Minister of Defense Osama al-Juwali and Interior Minister Fawzi Abd Ali to be more efficient in
administering their positions. According to this individual, el-Keib fears that al-Juwali, who was a western commander
during the revolution, may be maintaining a secret relationship with Belhaj and his allies. In response, Jai warned el-Keib
to avoid trying to use the regular military forces posted around Benghazi under General Khalifa Beloasim Hefter in an
effort to restrain the former militia troops as such a step could lead to civil war.
3.(Source Comment: In the opinion of an extremely well placed individual, el-Keib is, in fact, increasingly
frustrated by the inefficiency in his regime and the inability of hie ministers and administrators to arrange contracts with
foreign firms. He complains that his principal advisors, Minister of Oil Abdulrahman Ben Yezza and Minister of Finance
Hassan Zigiam, have been too timid in resolving the questions associated with contracts involving foreign firms, both old
and new. At present it appearsthat whenever one official raises a question regarding an agreement the entire matter is
put on hold and delayed. In the opinion of this source, el-Kelb knows that without these agreements he cannot meet the
demands of the veterans and the students. El-Keib stated in confidence, that he may have made a serious mistake in
removing the former oil/finance minister All Tatham' from the government. El-Kelb also noted that Jalil is shaken by the
January 21 attack on NTC headquarters end is searching for ways to appease the demonstrators. Most recently he
asked Abdel - Haltdh Ghoza, his principal deputy and NiC spokesman to step down. Ghoza, who comes from the
Benghazi area, was particularly unpopular with the western troops.)
4. Following the discussion with Jalil, el-Kieb ordered Ziglarn and Ngeb Obedoi, the head of the Stock Exchange,
to move with all possible speed to address the issue of the foreign contracts and arrange for new vendors to provide the
services demanded by the veterans and students. In this discussion he pointed out that if they cannot deal with this
situation they will not have to worry about the national elections in 2012, Libya will be an Islamic Republic, with BeMO as
the ruler. El-Kalb pointed out that foreign governments and large oil firms must be aware of this threat and that this will
frighten them into meeting the conditions for foreign contracts set out by the NTC.
5. (Source Comment: According to an extremely sensitive source, el-Keib spoke secretly with Hefter, stating that
he, and those troops loyal to him, should be prepared to move to protect the government in the event of increased
violence. This effort could include moving against Belhaj and attacking militia forces before they can unite and
organize. El-Keib emphasized that this is for planning purposes only, and no action should be taken until el-Kelb gives
the order. He emphasized that he will do everything possible to avoid civil war, but he is now concerned that Jai will be
unable to deal with the level of hostility against the NTC, and cannot be counted on to take strong positions against Belhaj
and his supporters. In the opinion of this individual, el-Keib cannot back away from his commitment to technicians in
senior positions, but he will press them as hard as he can to have the government respond to the needs of the veterans
and students. El-Keib believes it is not too late to address these problems, but they must move quickly.)

The Benghazi protestors appear to
be a pastiche of different groups of disaffected people including war-wounded, martyrs' families, transparency and
accountability demendeurs, and those who believe the east is once again being neglected. So the source of this report
attributing the whole thing to war-wounded does not jive, although they may have been the ones who carried out
the violent acts. The Belhaj bogeyman is a bit overplayed-no doubt his military influence has waned but he does remain
a player —one of many —looking to make political gain in this new environment The proposition that he is just lying in
waiting to take advantage of the current stability to move in and establish an Islamic state appears a bit
exaggerated. Minister of Labor Rajbani (who has his own axes to grind) said there is now a group of six ministers (I need
to clarify whether this is with al-Keeb's knowelcige or not) who are serving as the "cohones" of the cabinet and taking
decisions the others won't al-Keeb Is proceding cautiously (that is his strength and weakness) and that is the problem-
this is really the time for a "war-time" cabinet not the cautious approach he appears to be taking does not suit this volatile
time Let's see what the meeting today between the NTC and the government produces—the benghazi protests, the Bani
Walid conflict and the various other incidents that have flared up in recent days point to the need for some real drastic
movement in the DDR process and in the other issues that engender current dissatisfaction among the populace. I can
really comment on the points regarding foreign contracts except to say it rings true given the current governments
reluctance to make any significant decisions, especially regarding past or future issues of money. The Hefter piece also
sounds a bridge too far given al-Keeb's disposition. But I do agree that it is not too late if this government can just
organize itself and take some fundamental decisions to i mprove liquidity, get the real war-wounded good treatment and
push the MOD and MOI to speed up the DDR process.

3. (Source Comment In the opinion of an extremely well placed individual, el-Keib is, in fact, increasingly
frustrated by the inefficiency in his regime and the Inability of his ministers and administrators to arrange contracts with
foreign firms. He complains that his principal advisors, Minister of Oil Abdulrahman Ben Yezza and Minister of Finance
Hassan Ziglam, have been too timid in resolving the questions associated with contracts involving foreign firms, both old
and new. At present it appears that whenever one official raises a question regarding an agreement the entire matter is
put on hold and delayed. In the opinion of this source, el-Keib knows that without these agreements he cannot meet the
demands of the veterans and the students. El-Keib stated in confidence, that he may have made a serious mistake in
removing the former oil/finance minister Ali Tarhouni from the government. El-Keib also noted that JalIl is shaken by the
January 21 attack on NTC headquarters and is searching for ways to appease the demonstrators. Most recently he
asked Abdel — Hafidh Ghoza, his principal deputy and NTC spokesman to step down. Ghoza, who comes from the
Benghazi area, was particularly unpopular with the western troops.)
4. Following the discussion with Jalil, el-Kieb ordered Ziglam and Ngeb Obeda, the head of the Stock Exchange,
to move with all possible speed to address the issue of the foreign contracts and arrange for new vendors to provide the
services demanded by the veterans and students. In this discussion he pointed out that if they cannot deal with this
situation they will not have to worry about the national elections in 2012, Libya will be an Islamic Republic, with Belhaj as
the ruler. El-Keib pointed out that foreign governments and large oil firms must be aware of this threat and that this will
frighten them into meeting the conditions for foreign contracts set out by the NTC.
5. (Source Comment According to an extremely sensitive source, el-Keib spoke secretly with Haftar, stating that
he, and those troops loyal to him, should be prepared to move to protect the government in the event of increased
violence. This effort could include moving against Belhaj and attacking militia forces before they can unite and
organize. El-Keib emphasized that this is for planning purposes only, and no action should be taken until el-Keib gives
the order. He emphasized that he will do everything possible to avoid civil war, but he is now concerned that Jalil will be
unable to deal with the level of hostility against the NTC, and cannot be counted on to take strong positions against Belhaj
and his supporters. In the opinion of this individual, el-Keib cannot back away from his commitment to technicians in
senior positions, but he will press them as hard as he can to have the government respond to the needs of the veterans
and students. El-Keib believes it is not too late to address these problems, but they must move quickly.)

Benghazi's Deep Throat fingers Islamist Leaders for
Attacks as State Dept Criticized on Consular Security
Posted on 12/19/2012 by Juan
The report saying that security was inadequate at the compound that the US had adopted as its ad hoc
consulate in Benghazi, Libya, dominates today's headlines. That conclusion is obvious. The
"consulate" was just a private residence taken over for this purpose by the US in the city. It was not
constructed to be a US government building in a potentially hostile city.
I met a person who worked there when I was in Benghazi in June, and she told me that it wasn't even
clear if the consulate would be retained after the first of this year It was possibly temporary,
depending on Congressional funding. (The Tea Party House hasn't been good on meeting requests for
embassy security funds).
The more interesting question than why ad hoc arrangements should have been made for a consulate
during and after the Libyan revolution (the answer to which seems fairly obvious) is, who is
responsible for the string of assassinations and acts of violence in the city, of which the RPG attack on
the consulate on September 11 was only one? Benghazi, with a population of over one million in a
country of 6.5 million, is Libya's second largest city and was the epicenter of the revolution against the
government of Muammar Qaddafi in 2011.
On November 22, Benghazi police chief Farej Darssi was assassinated. In October a police colonel
barely avoided death— his car was wired to explode. A Libyan intelligence officer was killed in
September. A general was assassinated in August. Some of these figures had worked for Qaddafi but
had defected to the revolution. QacIdafi's security forces were responsible for the 1996 massacre of
hardline fundamentalists at Abu Salim prison, and for making others just disappear. Likely the same
shadowy cells that attacked the US consulate are behind the attacks on Benghazi police and army
officers.
There may have been a break in the case. Last Saturday, Benghazi securiV forces loyal to the elected
government in Tripoli, captured a man they suspected of being involved with the groups behind the

violence.And, he appears to have been willing to spill the beans. So let's call him the Libyan Deep
Throat.
Deep Throat is so knowledgeable about the conspiracies facing the city and so dangerous to those
hatching them that the latter immediately attempted to spring him from jail.
On Sunday morning, militants attacked the police facility next to the holding cell where the man is
being detained. A policeman at that station died in a hail of bullets from the attackers, and they called
for back-up. The police ear that sped to the scene was ambushed and three policemen in it were killed.
Still, the police stood their ground and fought off the assault, and they kept their valuable suspect in
custody, with all his valuable testimony.
Shortly after midnight, on Monday morning, small explosives were set off at the Garyounis police
station in Benghazi, damaging a couple of automobiles but otherwise doing little damage. Then
explosives were set off at al-Uruba pollee station, which also took sniper fire, but neither resulted in
casualties.
The police became vigilant, and they apprehended a shady-looking man skulking around near the al-
Hadaeg police station, finding him to have two rocket propelled grenades in his possession, which he
was apparently intending to fire at the station.
In other words, the capture of Libyan Deep Throat has set off a gang war on the police, who are being
informed by bombings and shootings that they must let their informant go or risk their
So what is Deep Throat saying? According to local journalist Mohamed Bujenah of the Libyan Herald,
a senior figure in the Benghazi police told him that the informant had fingered as many as 7
prominent Muslim fundamentalist leaders in connection with these attacks, of whom the police
named 6 explicitly:
Sufyan Ben Qumu, from the notoriously radical town of Duna, and a former prisoner at
Guantanamo
2.Ahmad Bukatela, leader of the Ubaida Militia
3.Muhammad al-Zahawi, head of the Ansar al-Sharia militia
4. Muhammad al-Gharabi, a leader of the Rafallah al-Sahati Militia
5.Ismail Sallabi, another leader of Rafallah al-Sahati
6.Salim Nabotes, head of the Zawiya Martyrs' Brigade
It is just a newspaper article. We don't know if the informant actually named these individuals or if he
did so to escape torture, in which case we can't trust what he said. But if the allegations are true, there
is collusion among several hardline militias in the city to create instability in hopes of taking it over.
The new, elected, prime minister All Zeidan, has started asserting himself militarily. He closed the
country's southern borders against instability in the Sahel. He may well have some risky house
cleaning to do in Benghazi.

1. On February 19, 2012, Libyan President Ylustafa Abdul Mil and Prime
Minister Abdurrahim el-Keib instructed Minister of the Interior Minister Fawzi Abd Ali

extremely sensitive source speaking in secret, el-Keib, acting in his role as the head of
government, told the two ministers that, if they could not stop the fighting and disarm
the militias he would be forced to find ministers who can carry out his orders. Ali and
Juwali each stated privately that, while they would follow orders, they have little hope of
succeeding in this matter until el-Keib and Jalil gain credibility as the rulers of the
country. Ali added that, in his opinion, this situation will persist until a new
government is chosen during the national elections planned for later in 2012.
2. In the opinion of this individual, the Prime Minister is particularly concerned
by the situation in the Southern portion of the country, where the area defined by the
towns of Ghat, Sabha, and al Kufra, where fighting between rival tribal and regional
militias has been exacerbated by the activities of Qaddafi loyalists, and their allies,
Taureg tribal fighters. This individual added that el-Keib and Jalil agree that the
uncertain security situation in this area represents a threat to Libya's future stability.
They agreed that, at present, if faced with a concerted effort by either disaffected
militiamen or pro-Qaddafi forces government security forces and the new national army
would be unable to protect either Libyan citizens or Western businessmen and oil
industry workers in the region.
3.(Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, el-Keib believes that any
attack against oil field workers will frighten large Western firms and seriously damage
Libya's efforts to recover from the revolution. This individual added that al Juwali is
particularly upset with his deputy Minister and Chief of Staff of the Army, General
Yousef Mangoush, who he believes has been unable to work with national army ground
force commander General Khalifa Belqasim Haftar. A very sensitive source added that
the Benghazi based units of the army, under Haftar's direct command, are currently
deploying to the area southeast of al-Kufra, along the Sudanese border.)
4. In the opinion of a sensitive source, Haftar and al Juwali believe that the
Sudanese military is providing arms and supplies to the pro-Qaddafi forces, under direct
orders from Sudanese President Omar al Bashir. El-Keib complained to al-Juwali that
Haftar's forces passed through al-Kufra region during early and mid-February on their
way to the Sudanese border, however; they did nothing to disarm the local revolutionary
militias, or stop the fighting between competing tribal groups. In the opinion of this
individual, Hafter felt that the threat from the pro-Qaddafi forces was greater than that
posed by the regional and tribal fighting.
5. At the same time, a source with excellent access to the leadership of the
National Transitional Council (NTC) stated in secret that fighting continues between
regional, tribal, and religious rivals throughout the Northern/Mediterranean portions of
the country. This same source added that the ongoing struggle between the Misrata and
Zintan militias for control of the area west of Tripoli is particularly violent and
disruptive for the rest of the country. In the capital itself, fighting continues between
regional groups, the national army, Islamist militias, and criminal street gangs, all of
whom are very well armed. This individual reports that during mid-February 2012 el-
Keib and Jalil agreed to address the problem of disaffected former militiamen and their
families by providing payments of 2,000 Dinars (approximately $1,500) per month to
the families of fighters who were wounded or killed in the revolution.
6. In addition the President and Prime Minister instructed Minister of Finance
Hassan Ziglam to develop an efficient system to provide assistance funds to unemployed
former fighters. For his part, Ziglam privately expressed concern that previous efforts in
this regard have met with a high level of fraud. According to the government's best
estimates, the revolutionary army included approximately 25,000 combat troops, but it
is difficult to identify those with legitimate claims, as no accurate service records were
maintained. That said, he stated in private that the government must be seen to take
some form of direct action, even if money is paid to fraudulent claimants. The fact is,

according to Ziglam, the NTC is losing control of the country and must give something
to the veterans of the revolution to slow this process.
7.(Source Comment: Speaking in strictest confidence, a knowledgeable
individual stated that al-Juwali is concerned by the possibility that the country may
deteriorate into a multi-sided civil war involving the regional militias, Islamist forces
and the national army. At the same time, he acknowledges that the new army has lost
control of large portions of the southern part of the country, with tribal fighting spilling
over into Mali and Chad. According to this source, al-Juwali is also frustrated by the
slow pace of military and police training promised to the various Libyan national
security forces by the governments of France and Turkey. He added that, while Turkey
has received some of the most seriously wound troops for treatment, the lack of
adequate medical care for veterans inside of Libya remains a major source of conflict
between the former rebel troops and the N'TC government)

am skeptical that Jalil and al-keeb are capable either by power or by character to deal with the shortcomings of their
MinDef and Minint in this way. The latter 2 are both very powerful by virtue of their Ziritan and lvlisrata roots
respectively, and any effort to remove them would have seriousblowback. MiniNt Fawzi who I saw the other day is
clearly way ahead of his colleague in getting the thuwar into the process of registration, the first step hopefully toward
DDR. I think everybody here is aware now how difficult the disarming of these militias, which have become de facto real
institutions in and of themselves. It is naieve to think they can be dissolved by executive fiat Some positive movement-
Jordanians preparing to accept first tranche of 1500 for police training.
There is concern here that continuing rivalries among the militias remains dangerous from the perspective of the havoc
they can wreak with their firepower and their continued control of select turf. At the end of the day, I think everybody is
coming to the conclusion that the elections will take place in the context of militia control. We hope that a program can
be devised to keep them acting responsibly toward the outcome of the election, especially viz the obligations they may
well be asked to undertake to keep elections free, and fair and devoid of violence. Always danger of continuing
skirmishes but Armageddon predictions a bit overstated.
We are all worried about the situation in Kufra and the clashes between the Arab alZwai tribe and the African tribe's the
Tebu. This is again a legacy of the Qadhafi era who played on these divisions to keep himself in control. The
government believes that the Tebu are being aided from al_Qadhafi elements and perhaps government supporters in
Sudan to undermine the TNC. There are some disturbing signs that in fact the TNC may be supporting the dispatch of
select militias to deploy down there maybe rpt maybe to "resolve" this ethnic problem as the situation in Tewarga was
resolved-i.e., "ethnic cleansing" --We are only at the very beginning stages of seeing whether there is credible evidence
on this score--so please rpt please don't raise any flags about it. It would be explosive.1 will keep you informed about any
info we develop.
No surprise about Heftat-he is extremely angry he lost out on the COS spot so his efforts to undermine the new COS
Mangoosh would be fully in line with his character to be big cheese.
The war wounded is a national tragedy. The former group allowed everybody to go abroad and they did to the tune of
800 million dollars. 50,000 Libyans abroad now 15 percent receiving medical treatment Who do you think the others
are? Relatives, frauds, and those who snuck out to get botox and tummy tucks. Senator McCain will rail about our
refusal to take thousands of them to the States but the process has been so bungled I think we did as much as we could
considering.

to establish a semi-autonomous zone in the historic province of Cyrenaica (Barge in Arabic). According to extremely
knowledgeable sources, this effort was initiated by advisors to French President Nicholas Sarkozy after complaints from
concerned French business leaders that the new Libyan Government was not rewarding appropriately French firms for the
leading role France played in supporting the 2011 revolution against former Dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. SIS joined in
this effort at the instruction of the office of Prime Minister David Cameron. This highly confidential effort comes in
response to the inability of the National Transitional Council (NTC) government in Tripoli to organize the country
effectively and deal with Western business interests in an effective and efficient manner.
2. The French and British business and intelligence officials believe that a semi autonomous regime in the
Eastern city of Benghazi will be able to organize business opportunities in that region. This in turn will allow these
Western firms to initiate new business projects. These same officials believe that there is also reduced threat from
Islamist militias in the East. According to a knowledgeable source, French officials believe that this situation is the natural
result of el-Keib's failure to organize the country and disarm the ethnic and regional militias who did the majority of the
fighting against Qaddafi's forces during the revolution.

3. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, the French Government and business leaders
actually expected to receive thirty five (35) per cent of new economic development in Libya after the fall of Qaddafi. Like
many Western businessmen, these French officials made informal agreements with former Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril
and his advisors, only to see these agreements ignored or delayed when Abdurrahim el-Keib became head of government
in October 2011. In their opinion, once el-Keib moved the government from the Eastern city of Benghazi to the national
capital at Tripoli, the government became inefficient and inaccessible. These individuals also believe that the
appointment of Minister of Oil Abdulrahman Ben Yezza, who was a long time official of the Italian Oil Company (EN!), was
a factor. According to these sources, the bulk of ENI's oil fields are in the Western part of Libya, and Ben Yezza focused
his attentions on that region, while failing to effectively organize new business East of Benghazi. These same officials
state that the influences of the Western militias, particularly those from the Zintan region, have weakened the influence of
the Eastern Elders.)
4. An extremely sensitive source stated that the DGSE and SIS.intend to control the move toward a semi-
autonomous state under a federal system. However, they have been surprised by el-Keib's intention, expressed both in
public and in secret meetings with Minister of Defense OUSetrill al JuwaIi, a native of Zintan, to use force to hold the
country together. El-Kelb is also committed to Ben Van, although he is frustrated by the chaotic situation in Tripoli. This
atmosphere affects new business for the most port and has been extremely irritating for businessmen from France and
other Western countries.
5. (Source Comment: In the opinion of well placed source with access to the former royal family (al Senussi),
while these Western officials are focused on working around the chaotic business situation, they are risking a civil war,
failing to recognized the longstanding and complicated relationship between the Eastern and Western parts of the
country. Cladeafi, as an absolute dictator, suppressed these differences, which have reemerged with his defeat and
death. In addition, al-Keib is talking to old acquaintances in the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, in an effort to apply their
influence tothe Eastern tribal Elders, and help hold the country together.)

the LMB's electoral prospects. He didn't think they would have a large following b/c they don't have a strong
organization and because most Libyans view the LMB as a branch of the Egyptian MB, and Libyans don't want to be
ruled by Egypt. He did not mention the interesting point below about the LMB as a counterbalance to the eastern based
Federalists. He did emphasize, though, that the Federalist movement has widespread support in the east and will

Below is the latest report from HRC's contact; would be interested in your reactions.
SOURCE:
Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of European
Governments, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1.
During the last week of March 2012, the leaders of the National Transitional Council (NTC) regime in Libya discussed
the rising popularity and independence of the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood (LMB) in preparation for the national
parliamentary elections scheduled for July 2012.
According to a source with direct access to these discussions, President Mustafa Abclel Jalil stated in very direct terms
that he sees the emergence of the LMB as a major factor in the upcoming elections, which are already complicated by
the Federalist movement for the semi autonomous status of the historic Eastern Libyan region of
Cyrenaica (Barge in Arabic).
Minister of Defense Ousarra al Juwali and Prime Minister Abdurrahirn el Keib both believe that the rise of the LMB,
which was a relatively minor member of the NTC until November 2011, is, in fact, related to the Federalist movement fl
Eastern Libya.

According to al Juwali, a native of the Western Libyan region of Zintan, the LMB is drawing strength from people who
fear that the Federalist movement in Barqa will result in that region dominating the country, gaining control of an
inordinate share of the country's oil and mineral reserves.
For his part, Jalil stated that he agrees with Oil Minister Abdulrahman Ben Yezza that if matters are not resolved by the
July elections, the unsettled nature of the political process in Libya will damage the country's image as a business
partner and confuse foreign banks and oil firms attempting to open new contacts with the new Libyan Government, or
reactivate existing agreements.
2.
According to a sensitive source, while discussing this matter with Dr Abd al-Nasser Shamata, the head of the Crisis
Management Unit in the NTC, Prime Minister el Keib stated that the most problematic aspect of the rise of the LMB is
the leadership role taken by Islamist militia leader General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj.
In the opinion of this source, the NTC leadership sees Belhaj as one of the greatest threats to the long term success of
their regime.
Al Juwali also notes that Belhaj is the head of the founding committee for the LMB's Justice and Construction Party
(JCP). As the Federalist movement took hold in early March 2012, al Juwali, under instruction from el Keib and Jalil, met
with Belhaj and other Western militia leaders to arrange for their support In the event military force is needed to hold
the country together.
Belhaj represented the most effective of the Western militias.
3.
According to the Minister of Defense, this situation with the Federalist movement enhanced Belhaj's prestige at the
time he was working to secure a leadership role in the LMB and the JCP.
El Keib and Jalil are concerned that, despite the fact that the LMB has a limited base after years of suppression by the
regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi, they will appeal to those Libyans who believe that the NTC regime is
under the influence of the United States and Western Europe.
The activities of Belhaj in both the LMB and the JCP reinforce this view.
Jalil finds this situation frustrating, particularly in the light of his regular assurances that Libya would operate under
Islamic law, and while maintaining appropriate ties to the West, will remain hostile to Israel.
4. (Source Comment:
In a private conversation, Jalil stated that he is working to balance the internal political realities of Libya against the
concerns of the international business community.
The President is concerned that the appointment of BenYezza as Oil Minister in October 2011 provided the JCP with a
tangible concern to use against NTC candidates during the July elections.
After his long experience as a senior official of the Multinational Italian Oil Firm ENI, Ben Yezza is viewed by Belhaj and
many members of the LMB as a symbol of the issue they will pursue in the national election, the idea that NTC, like the
Qaddafi, regime is corrupt and involved in allowing foreign interests to control the nation's mineral wealth.
That said, Jalil continues to agree with el Keib that Ben Yezza is an excellent administrator, and in the long run will play
an important role in effectively managing the nation's mineral wealth.)
5.
According to an extremely sensitive source, Jalil and his advisors have been in contact with Supreme Guide Mohamed
Badie, the leader of the much larger and more powerful Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood (EMB).
This contact is largely based on the President's need to address reports he has received that the LMB is reaching out to
Badie and his advisors for support.
This effort is particularly important given the belief among NTC leaders that the EMB and its Freedom and Justice Party
(FJP) will control the Government of Egypt as that country moves to civilian rule later in 2012. In the opinion of this
source, Badie is sympathetic to Jalil's position, especially since the Libyan President and el Keib were members of the
EMB during their student days in Egypt.
The Supreme Guide will, according to Jalil, work to influence the LMB to establish a cooperative effort with the NTC.
Badie will point out the fact that his ability to cooperate with both the Supreme Council for the Armed Force (SCAF), as
well as the Salafist al Nour party, helped establish the EMB as the dominant political force in Egypt, while avoiding high
levels of violence.
6.
(Source Comment: An extremely sensitive source within the EMB agreed that Badie and Jalil have spoken in an effort to
develop a plan to deal with the LMB.

According to this source, Jalil told Badie that the LMB and the JCP are far more intolerant of foreign business and
banking interests than the NTC, and a strong showing in the July elections will strengthen Belhaj and other conservative
Islamists, adversely affecting the Libyan economy, which in turn will cause problems for Egypt as it recovers from its own
revolution in 2011.
Jalil emphasized that at this point the NTC has managed to avoid violent outbursts between competing groups, even in
the face of the Federalist movement in the East, in a region that borders Egypt.
He warned that an LMB/JCP victory might change this and lead to increased violence between rival militias that could
wash over into Egypt.)
7.
According to a sensitive source, the LMB has a complex history and Jalil and el Keib believe this past may hold some
points which can be used against the Brotherhood and the JCP in the July elections.
The TNTC leaders know that after Qaddafi came to power in 1969, the LMB was repressed and many of its leaders were
executed publicly. Eventually the Brotherhood, having reestablished itself in the United States and Europe, entered into
a dialogue with the Qaddafi regime 1999, and in 2005 began a series of negotiations with SW al-Islam Qaddafi, whose
goal was to co-opt and neutralize opposition groups, particularly Islamist ones.
8.
According to this individual, Belhaj and the other Islamist leaders mistrusted the LMB during the first months of the
2011 revolution.
However, Belhaj eventually established a working relationship with Fawzi Abu Kitef, the head of the Revolutionary
Brigades Coalition in Eastern Libya and the former deputy defense minister in the NTC. Abu Kltef was a leading figure in
the LMB who spent more than 18 years in prison, including the notorious facility at Abu SeIlm. Under Abu Kitef and
leaders like Dr. Abdullah Shamia, who was in charge of the economic committee of the NTC, the Brotherhood
established itself as a unique group within the Jai Keib regime; serving there until they began to plan for
independent political activity in late 2011 and early 2012.
9.
In early 2012, as the relationship between the NTC and Belhaj and the other Islamists deteriorated in the face of
regional and ethnic power struggles, the LMB leadership, in coordination with Belhaj began to look at an independent
political effort in the parliamentary elections. During its first public conference in Benghazi during November 2011, the
LMB elected a new leader, increased its consultative council membership from 11 to 30 leaders, and decided to form a
political party; the JCP.
Mohammed Swan, the former head of the Libyan LMB's Consultative Council, won a tight victory over longtime LMB
leader Soliman Abd al-Qadr, to become the first leader of the JCP. Bashir al-Kubty was elected General Observer of the
LMB.
10.(Source comment: According to an individual with excellent access, the LMB leaders are sensitive to charges
that the JCP is a party with a narrow religious agenda, and they encouraged Walid al-Sakran, non-member of the LMB, to
compete as a candidate for JCP leadership.
That said Belhaj and other Islamist leaders believe that the LMB is set to follow the electoral path of Islamist success
seen in Egypt, Tunisia, and other Arab countries.
Belhaj now believes that the country will move forward under sharia law, administered by the Islamist bloc, including
the LMB/JCP

Jake: I have been reading this over and over and it just seemed a bit odd to me. I finally figured out that I think the

Haj and a second one is Larnin Bel Haj, an Islamist leader who I believe had previously I believe somehow been involved
In Sudan but was now back in his native Ubya. The latter is the head of the JCP and MB. The former is of the former LIFG

control over Matega Airport for several months after October 23 and who tried to make himself the Supreme Military
Council Commander of Tripoli before the TNC leadership stepped in several months ago. Let me try to untangle this and
see if any of it jibes with the reality we are seeing.

Very interesting report. By chance, I met with our insightful in Benghazi yesterday and we discussed B6
the LIVIB's electoral prospects. He didn't think they would have a large following b/c they don't have a strong
organization and because most Libyans view the LMB as a branch of the Egyptian MB, and Libyans don't want to be
ruled by Egypt. He did not mention the interesting point below about the LMB as a counterbalance to the eastern based
Federalists. He did emphasize, though, that the Federalist movement has widespread support in the east and will
continue to up the ante with Tripoli, including possibly making a move on the oil production in that part of the country
(AGOCO, a large state-owned oil company, is based in Benghazi). -- Chris

Below is the latest report from NBC's contact; would be interested in your reactions.
SOURCE:
Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of European
Governments, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1.
During the last week of March 2012, the leaders of the National Transitional Council (NTC) regime in Libya discussed
the rising popularity and independence of the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood (LMB) in preparation for the national
parliamentary elections scheduled for July 2012.
According to a source with direct access to these discussions, President Mustafa Abdel Jalil stated in very direct terms
that he sees the emergence of the LMB as a major factor in the upcoming elections, which are already complicated by
the Federalist movement for the semi-autonomous status of the historic Eastern Libyan region of
Cyrenaica (Berea in Arabic).
Minister of Defense Ousama al Juwall and Prime Minister Abdurrahim el Keib both believe that the rise of the LMB,
which was a relatively minor member of the NTC until November 2011, is, in fact, related to the Federalist movement in
Eastern Libya.
According to at Juwali, a native of the Western Libyan region of Zintan, the LMB is drawing strength from people who
fear that the Federalist movement in Barge will result in that region dominating the country, gaining control of an
inordinate share of the country's oil and mineral reserves.
For his part, Jalil stated that he agrees with Oil Minister Abcluirahman Ben 'lima that if matters are not resolved by the
July elections, the unsettled nature of the political process in Libya will damage the country's image as a business
partner and confuse foreign banks and oil firms attempting to open new contacts with the new Libyan Government, or
reactivate existing agreements.
2.
According to a sensitive source, while discussing this matter with Dr Abd al-Nasser Shamata, the head of the Crisis
Management Unit in the NTC, Prime Minister el Keib stated that the most problematic aspect of the rise of the LMB is
the leadership role taken by Islamist militia leader General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj.
In the opinion of this source, the NTC leadership sees Belhaj as one of the greatest threats to the long term success of
their regime.
Al Juwali also notes that Belhaj is the head of the founding committee for the LMB's Justice and Construction Party
(JCP). As the Federalist movement took hold in early March 2012, al Juwali, under instruction from el Keib and Jalil, met
with Belhaj and other Western militia leaders to arrange for their support in the event military force is needed to hold
the country together.
Beihaj represented the most effective of the Western militias.
3.
According to the Minister of Defense, this situation with the Federalist movement enhanced Belhaj's prestige at the
time he was working to secure a leadership role in the LMB and the JCP.
El Keib and Jalil are concerned that, despite the fact that the LMB has a limited base after years of suppression by the
regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi, they will appeal to those Libyans who believe that the NTC regime is
under the influence of the United States and Western Europe.
The activities of Belhaj in both the LMB and the JCP reinforce this view.
Jalil finds this situation frustrating, particularly in the light of his regular assurances that Libya would operate under
Islamic law, and while maintaining appropriate ties to the West, will remain hostile to Israel.

In a private conversation, Jalil stated that he is working to balance the internal political realities of Libya against the
concerns of the international business community.
The President is concerned that the appointment of BenYezza as Oil Minister in October 2011 provided the JCP with a
tangible concern to use against NTC candidates during the July elections.
After his long experience as a senior official of the Multinational Italian Oil Firm ENI, Ben Yezza is viewed by Belhaj and
many members of the LMB as a symbol of the issue they will pursue in the national election, the idea that NTC, like the
Qaddafi, regime is corrupt and involved in allowing foreign interests to control the nation's mineral wealth.
That said, Jalil continues to agree with el Keib that Ben Yezza is an excellent administrator, and in the long run will play
an important role in effectively managing the nation's mineral wealth.)
5.
According to an extremely sensitive source, Jalil and his advisors have been in contact with Supreme Guide Mohamed
Badie, the leader of the much larger and more powerful Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood (EMB).
This contact is largely based on the President's need to address reports he has received that the LMB is reaching out to
Badie and his advisors for support.
This effort is particularly important given the belief among NTC leaders that the EMB and its Freedom and Justice Party
(FJP) will control the Government of Egypt as that country moves to civilian rule later in 2012. In the opinion of this
source, Badie is sympathetic to Jalirs position, especially since the Libyan President and el Keib were members of the
EMB during their student days in Egypt.
The Supreme Guide will, according to J3111, work to influence the LMB to establish a cooperative effort with the NTC.
Sadie will point out the fact that his ability to cooperate with both the Supreme Council for the Armed Force (SCAF), as
well as the Salafist al Nour party, helped establish the EMB as the dominant political force in Egypt, while avoiding high
levels of violence.
6.
(Source Comment: An extremely sensitive source within the EMB agreed that Badie and Jalil have spoken in an effort to
develop a plan to deal with the LMB.
According to this source, Jalil told Badie that the LMB and the JCP are far more intolerant of foreign business and
banking interests than the NTC, and a strong showing in the July elections will strengthen Belhaj and other conservative
Islamists, adversely affecting the Libyan economy, which in turn will cause problems for Egypt as it recovers from its own
revolution in 2011.
Jalil emphasized that at this point the NTC has managed to avoid violent outbursts between competing groups, even in
the face of the Federalist movement in the East, in a region that borders Egypt.
He warned that an LMB/JCP victory might change this and lead to increased violence between rival militias that could
wash over into Egypt.)
7.
According to a sensitive source, the LMB has a complex history and Jalil and el Keib believe this past may hold some
points which can be used against the Brotherhood and the JCP in the July elections.
The TNTC leaders know that after Qaddafi came to power in 1969, the LMB was repressed and many of its leaders were
executed publicly. Eventually the Brotherhood, having reestablished itself in the United States and Europe, entered into
a dialogue with the Qaddafi regime 1999, and in 2005 began a series of negotiations with Saif Qaddafi, whose
goal was to co-opt and neutralize opposition groups, particularly Islamist ones.
8.
According to this individual, Belhaj and the other Islamist leaders mistrusted the LMB during the first months of the
2011 revolution.
However, Belhaj eventually established a working relationship with Fawzi Abu Kitef, the head of the Revolutionary
Brigades Coalition in Eastern Libya and the former deputy defense minister in the NTC. Abu Kitef was a leading figure in
the LMB who spent more than 18 years in prison, including the notorious facility at Abu Selim. Under Abu Kitef and
leaders like Dr. Abdullah Shamia, who was in charge of the economic committee of the NTC, the Brotherhood
established itself as a unique group within the Jain/el Keib regime; serving there until they began to plan for
independent political activity in late 2011 and early 2012.
9.
In early 2012, as the relationship between the NTC and Belhaj and the other Islamists deteriorated in the face of
regional and ethnic power struggles, the LMB leadership, in coordination with Belhaj began to look at an independent
political effort in the parliamentary elections. During its first public conference in Benghazi during November 2011, the

10. (Source comment: According to an individual with excellent access, the LMB leaders are sensitive to charges
that the JCP is a party with a narrow religious agenda, and they encouraged Walid al-Sakran, non-member of the LMB, to
compete as a candidate for JCP leadership.
That said Belhaj and other Islamist leaders believe that the LMB is set to follow the electoral path of Islamist success
seen in Egypt, Tunisia, and other Arab countries.
Belhaj now believes that the country will move forward under sharia law, administered by the Islamist bloc including

Jake- Interesting report. Gene is closer to the action and I defer to him on the latest Jail-ian thinking
and machinations vis-a-vis the cabinet and INC. I hadn't heard about ENI-related corruption but
wouldn't be surprised.
On the federalism issue,. Jail is right to be concerned about eastern agitation for autonomy. A
cabinet chance won't solve that problem, though. Nor will recruiting Belhaj and Islamist fighters to
take on the Bardans. To the contrary, it would only lead to unwanted bloodshed - the large Obeid
tribe still nurses a serious grudge against Belhaj and his ilk for the Islamists' presumed role in killing their
beloved Gen. Yunis last July and would probably put up a fierce fight.
The cabinet and INC need to have a serious discussion with the Bargans - if they aren't already
doing so - about how power and resources are to be distributed in the new Libya. The Libyans held
similarly heated debates on this very topic in the early1950s as they held their first parliamentary
elections and drafted their constitution (there were actually violent skirmishes in connection with
those elections, and Washington delayed the arrival of the first US ambassador until after things had
calmed down). Hopefully the current leadership can negotiate these issues peaceably in the
corning months. Of course, we and the UN and our other partners should encourage them to do so.

Let me know your thoughts:
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of
European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1.On April 17, 2012 Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jalil stated to a close
advisor that he is considering when, or even if, to hold a vote of no confidence in the NTC regarding support for the
government of Prime Minister Abdel Rahman al-Keib. According to a source with access to the NTC leadership, Jalil
realizes that a majority of the Council members no longer support el-Keib and his cabinet of Western educated technical
experts. Jaili continues to believe that, for the moment, the most important issue facing the NTC is the federalist
movement toward a semi-autonomous state in the Eastern region of Cyrenaica (Barge in Arabic). This situation continues
to complicate the NTC efforts to stabilize the country. With this in mind, Jalil expressed concern that a dramatic vote of no
confidence for el-Keib will weaken the entire NTC by association. Instead, according to this source, Jalil is considering
delaying a CiOCISI011, possibly putting it off until an elected legislature is in place in the late summer or early fall of 2012.
2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, the NTC has been able to reach a temporary
understanding with the eastern federalists, allowing the separatists to administer their local regions, while deferring to the
NTC for national and international issues. The complicating factor at this point lies in reaching a determination regarding
who has authority over new contracts with oil companies and other international firms. As of the week of April 16, 2012,
no decision has been reached on this point. The bulk of the NTC leadership is drawn from Barge, and Jalil now believes
they can control the situation if they can establish an organized central government. In particular, Jalil, according to a
sensitive source, is increasingly confident that the eastern roots of the NTC will allow him to balance the federalist
movement against the need for a sense of national unity. In the opinion of this source, el-Keib's future depends on Jalil's
opinion of his capacity to deal with this complex situation.)
3. Minister of Defense Ousama al Juwali is viewed by Jalil as the most important western Libyan in el-Keib's
cabinet, and the President and the leaders of the NTC had hoped that he would be able to deal with the confused security
situation in Tripoli. However, while he did receive assurances from General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj regarding
possible assistance from his Islamist troops if fighting broke out between the National Army and the militia's loyal to the
eastern federalists. Unfortunately, from Jalil's point of view, this effort seems to have emboldened Belhaj and heightened
tension between the eastern and western portions of the country. According to this source, after reviewing the federalist
problem, Dr Abd al-Nasser Shamata, the head of the Crisis Management for the NTC, believes that el-Keib, al Juwali, Oil
Minister Abdulrahman Ben Yezza, and the bulk of the cabinet should be replaced by people drawn from within the NTC,
individuals who are in touch with the concerns of the Libyan people of all tribes and political groups. In the opinion of this
source Jalil is factoring this position into his decision on el-Keib.
4. Regarding the existing relationships with international oil firms, Shamata told Jalil that for the most part the
existing fields are continuing to produce and the owners have worked out security arrangements with local political and
tribal leaders. However, since el-Keib and Ben Yezza have been unable to bring order to the national administration, it is
difficult for firms to initiate new projects, since it is not clear who has the authority or the desire to sign such
agreements. Shamata stated forcefully that the Prime Minister, whoever he is, must establish an orderly administration
before full advantage can be gained from the oil fields. In the meantime, Shamata warns that his office has found
evidence of corruption between local officials and international firms. In this regard, he stated that local representatives of
the Italian national oil firm (ENI) have made problematic arrangements with local officials in the western part of the
country, where their oil fields are located. He added that most of these ENI employees are Libyans, but he believes ENI
management in Italy is aware of this situation. Shamata pointed out, without additional comment, that Ben Yezza is a
long time senior official of ENI.
5. In the opinion this source, Shamata and Jalil are not planning to publicize these charges regarding ENI, at least
until they decide how best to move forward on el-Keib, whether to allow the Prime Minister more time to address his
problems, proceed with the vote of no confidence or quietly ask him to step down on his own.
6. (Source Comment: According to this source, el-Keib is under fire primarily as a result of his failure to bring
order to the National Army, disarm independent militias, and establish security throughout the country. The leading
opposition to el-Keib is based in the Political Issues committee of the NTC, and as many as 42 of the 73 active NTC
members will vote against el-Keib if Jalil brings this matter to a vote. The source warns that these numbers are provided
by members of this Political committee, who may have their own agenda. A two thirds majority is required for the no
confidence vote, however; several senior members of the NTC are reluctant to take such a step until a constituent
assembly has been elected. They do not want this to look like the decision of a small group of people.)

Subject: Talk with PM
I called PM el-Keib this morning to get his take on what we were all hearing about TNC final decisions to dismiss the
government, etc. I told him that after the British Ambassador and I had spoken to him and Jalil on Sunday, we had
hoped that these public skirmishes would end and that the government could focus on security and the elections. The
PM said that he had in fact met with Jalil on Monday and agreed to work together for the good of the nation. On
Tuesday, the PM had met with several Council members and had brought along proposed changes in some of the
ministerial portfolios. He sensed there was agreement from the Council members present and thought he had
succeeded in quelling the public discontent. Unfortunately, he continued, more public threats, etc. were issued and by
Wednesday evening he had had enough. That prompted his critical remarks in a press interview demanding that the TNC
stop interfering in the government's business and let him and his government do the work they needed to do without all
this negative background noise. He told me that we should not be concerned about last night's "rumors" and that he
would continue to work to end these fratricidal disputes. For his own role, he said he would be just as happy to give up
his post if matters came to that We will continue to try to reach out to other contacts today to see if in fact the Council
does intend to act against the government. But while the PM is clearly frustrated, he also seemed to believe that the
current strife will not result in any major shake-up, at least for the time being.

SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of
European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. As of the morning of July 6, an individual with access to the information stated in confidence that Libyan National
Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jalil remains committed to a transfer of power to a popularly elected
government; however, he is prepared to extend the life of the NTC as a guarantor of stability for the Libyan people
following the July 7, 2012 election for seats in a 200-member General National Congress (GNC). Jalil realizes that 2.7
million Libyans have registered to vote and are generally anxious to replace the increasingly unpopular NTC. That said,
Jalil expects the voting to lead to a period of confusion and he will not abandon his authority until the results are fixed.
2. Jalil is also frustrated by the fact that during its eight-month tenure of the administration of Prime Minister Abdel
Rahman el-Keib - who was appointed by the NTC — was unable to provide solutions for Libya's long list of needs: a
functioning justice system, a reconciliation process for officials who served the old administration, the disarming of
militia, building functional national security forces, rebuilding destroyed areas, and delivering basic services such as
healthcare.
3. At the same time, outside of the oil sector, much of Libya's economy is stagnant, and in the opinion of Western
security officials, lacks the government's go-ahead to restart public sector infrastructure contracts. In addition,
international advisers and foreign investors are reluctant to return to an environment where the government will not
sign long term agreements and cannot guarantee security.
4. (Source Comment: According to an extremely sensitive source, Jalil continues to believe that this chaotic situation
should not be surprising. He regularly points out that eight months is not a sufficient amount of time to build functioning
institutions from the remnants of the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. The old regime featured a
dysfunctional bureaucracy, idiosyncratic rule, and anti-institutionalism. Additionally, Jalil now realizes that due to
pronounced incompetence and a lack of will to take unpopular decisions the el-Keib government also failed to make
progress in the few areas where it could have achieved meaningful change. The towns of Sirte and Tawargha are
representative of the situation in the countryside where people lost their homes in the conflict and have been living in
temporary camps with limited ability to register and vote in their home district. Jalil has been urged by contacts in the
French and Italian Governments to guarantee the rights of people across the country. In particular, he has serious
concerns as to whether or not supporters of former dictator fv1uammar al Qaddafi in his hometown of Sirte will be
included in the future political processes of the new Libya; if they are not allowed to vote by local militiamen. At the
same time the fighting between Libyan Arabs and Tebu tribesmen in the Kufra area threatens to prevent any voting

there. Jalil has been warned that the NTC regulations now state that members of the National Army are not allowed to
vote or run for office, which is a disincentive for armed militia brigade members to become legitimate soldiers.)
5.This well informed individual believes that despite these flaws, the new government created by the July 7 election will
eventually have the mandate to take the difficult decisions that can create a reconciliation process. Jalil will work to
maintain order in this transition period, and finally reach his goal of creating a situation where the government can
rebuild homes and restore sufficient law and order; allowing those in Sirte, Tawargha, Kufra, and throughout the rest of
the country to live in their hometowns, establishing a situation where a true civil society can develop.
6. Jalil, in conversations with the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB), and separately with liberal leader All
Tarhouni, has acknowledged that the central government's top priority must be security and that the NTC has been
unable to provide it. That said, Jalil and Minister of Defense Ousarna al-Juwali have pledged to provide 30,000 to 40,000
security personnel for election day to 'prevent similar incidents to the July 1 attack on Benghazi's election headquarters.
In that case eastern federalists entered the building, where ballot papers were burned and ballot boxes destroyed.
Similarly, these federalist forces are suspected of the attack on July 5 that burned down Ajdabiyals main storage centre
for election materials.
7. In the opinion of this individual, although those responsible for the Benghazi attack were pro-federalist, it has not
been proven that they were members of the self-appointed Cyrenaican National Council (CNC), whose military arm set
up a roadblock in Wadi al-Ahmar on Libya's major east-west highway to demand that Cyrenaica get as many seats in the
GNC as Tripolitania. Thus far, neither the CNC nor any other group has publicly stated that they intend to use violence to
disrupt the elections. (Note: Under the current system Tripolitania will have 120 seats in the GNC, Cyrenaica (Barqa) 62,
and Fezzan in the South 18.)

Jake - Thanks for this. Tracks with what we are hearing about elections and the weakness of the interim govt. Elections
are going smoothly throughout most of Libya (Ajdabiya being the exception, where some ballots were sabotaged
requiring voting in some centers to be postponed for a few hours). Factoring in time to tally votes and process appeals,
the UN and the Libyan elections commission are anticipating announcing final results by late July. The expectation is
that the TNC will remain in power until the new congress is seated.
Sett McCain and I toured the new parliament this afternoon, where we encountered a TNC member, an engineer and a
couple of UN experts reviewing progress on the interior decor of the main chamber. They are racing to get the chamber
finished in time for the first session. The UN is offering technical assistance to the secretariat of the new congress,
ranging from parliamentary procedure to legislative drafting. They're even helping to plot out the choreography of the
first sessions.
The atmosphere in Tripoli is very festive. The gov't declared today a holiday and people are driving around honking and
waving flags and making peace sign gestures. We visited several polling stations where we found people patiently
waiting in lines (gender segregated) lvlcCain was applauded and thanked for his support wherever we went.

Re: New president of Libya
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels
of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. During early August, 2012, Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel
Jalil held discreet meetings with Mohammed Yussef Magariaf, the then leader of the newly elected General
National Congress (GNC), who Jalil learned was to be named interim President of Libya when the NTC stepped
down. During these sessions the two leaders worked out the transition to a new, elected interim Government for
Libya; focusing on the need to restore stability and security by disarming the militia units which fought in the
2011 revolution against former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. According to a source with excellent access to
both parties, Jalil came away from the meeting convinced that Magariaf is intent on becoming Libya's first
elected president following the overthrow of Qaddafi. Jalil was pleased to learn that Magariaf strongly supports

the three-party Cairo Declaration negotiated between the NTC and the Governments of Tunisia and Egypt in
late July allowing for increased trade and a relaxation of existing travel restrictions.
2. According to this individual, Jalil and Magariaf agree that Tunisia and Egypt hold the key to Libya's
future economic success, with Libya providing the funding for new projects, while Egypt and Tunisia provide
technical expertise. Magariaf stated privately that this relationship marks a departure from the Qaddafi years
when Libya's natural resources fell under the control of foreign firms and governments. Jalil added that
Magariaf will welcome investment and cooperation from American and Western European banks and
corporations, but believes Libya, supported by the new governments rising out of the Arab Spring, must
maintain control over all aspects of the industries involved in exploiting its natural resources. In this regard,
with the support of both Jalil and Magariaf, the Libyan Ministry of Finance is increasing the level of Libyan
investment in the Cairo stock exchange. In turn, Magariaf and Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi discussed
increased Tunisian and Egyptian investment in the Benghazi stock exchange as the economic situation in Libya
becomes more orderly.
3. In commenting on the new Interim President, Jalil added that Magariaf s current position is bolstered
by the fact that he is not tied to any particular faction. At the same time he has maintained the respect that is
attached to his role as the first Libyan leader to direct an armed revolt against Qaddafi. This fighting was
carried out by the rebel Libyan National Army in 1981. Magariaf is an academic and diplomat with well
established Islamist credentials and good relationships with business and government leaders in the United
States and Western Europe. A separate sensitive source noted that one interesting issue to watch is Magariaf s
relationship with General Khalifa Belgasim Hefter, the commander of one sections of the new Libyan Army.
Halter has been at odds with many of the militia commanders and is currently leading Libyan forces in the
Kufra region, attempting to end local tribal fighting and block the smuggling of arms and supplies to pro-
Qaddafi militias by supporters based in South Sudan. In the years between 1981 and 1990 Hefter (then Colonel
Halter) commanded the rebel Libyan National Army, under 'vineries National Front for the Salvation of
Libya (1\IFSL). One source notes that Magariafs opposition to Qaddafi was based on the dictator's betrayal of
Islamic principles, a position that, at that time, was supported by the Western Allies.
4. According to this individual, Jail also spoke with former Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril, who
indicated that he and Magariaf agree on many issues, including the belief that they can build an Islamic state in
Libya that can function in the world economy and the international diplomatic community. He did note that he
believes Magariaf s view of the role of Islam in the day to day function of the government is more conservative
than his, but these are differences that can be sorted out in the GNC. In the opinion of this individual Jabril is
well aware of the fact that, while his National Force Alliance (NFA) controls a solid bloc of thirty nine (39)
seats in the GNC and Magariaf s National Front Party (NFP) holds no seats in its own right, the interim
President has established good working relationships with at least 100 of the 120 independent members of the
GNC. Magariaf received 113 votes in his election as Interim President. Again these independent deputies
respect Magariaf s role in fighting the Qaddafi regime.
S. (Source Comment: This particularly sensitive individual stated in strict confidence that Magariaf sees
his role as establishing an efficient interim government, while overseeing the drafting of a new constitution and
election law. This individual believes that Magariaf is very interested in winning the presidency under this new
law. Besides meeting with Jail and Jibril, Magariaf is talking to liberal politicians including former Oil and
Finance Minister Ali Tarhouni, and the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood's (MB) Justice and Construction
Party (ICP), including Mohamed &swan.)
6. This individual adds that Jalil believes Magariaf will face a very difficult period as he addresses the
many issues left unresolved by the NTC and the interim regime of Prime Minister Abdel Rahman el-Keib. Jail
has been highly frustrated by el-Keib's inability to disarm the many militia units left over from the 2011
revolution against Qaddafi. At the same time he has advised Magariaf to move quickly in replacing el-Keib's
cabinet while deciding which ministers to retain. The new interim government is facing a problem of
lawlessness and attacks against foreigners, including representatives of the Egyptian Government; this at a time

when the new Muslim Brotherhood government of Egypt is reaching out to increase business and diplomatic
contacts between the two countries. According to a sensitive source, Libyan military intelligence officers
believe these attacks are the work of Qaddafi loyalists, while former NTC officials fear that they may be carried
out by dissident Islamist groups, frustrated with the results of the national elections, which many of them
boycotted.
7. (Source Comment: An extremely sensitive source stated in confidence that Libyan Military
Intelligence officers reported to Jalil and later Magariaf that a series of bombings in Tripoli and Benghazi
appear to be the work of Qaddafi loyalists looking to create tension between the Libyan and Egyptian
Governments. These attacks included the car of an Egyptian diplomat, which was blown up near his home in
Benghazi, a day after several deadly bomb attacks in the capital Tripoli. At the same time, a homemade bomb
exploded under the vehicle of the Egyptian consulate's first secretary Abdelhamid Rifai in one of the Tripoli's
most affluent neighborhoods. No one was hurt during this attack. Earlier in August, three car bombs exploded
near the Ministry of Interior in Tripoli, killing two people and wounding three others. This sensitive source
added that security officers arrested 32 members of what they describe as an organized network of Gaddafi
loyalists linked to the attacks. During this period, the Red Cross suspended its activities in Benghazi and
Misrata after one of its compounds in Misrata was attacked with grenades and rockets. In late July seven
Iranian relief workers associated with the Libyan Red Crescent were kidnapped by tribal troops still loyal to the
Qaddafi family. Security officials have no word on the whereabouts of these relief workers.)
8. According to this source, while the Cairo Declaration received a positive reception among Libyan
political and business leaders, it also created a drastic increase in the number of Libyan's applying for Egyptian
visas under the new, simplified process. This workload has created a backlog of applications, and in mid-
August, a group of Libyan nationals frustrated with the Egyptian visa process attacked the interior of the
Egyptian consulate in Tripoli. These Libyan applicants were angry about the time it was taking to receive visas
to enter Egypt and were demanding that the staff work past their stated hours of operation. A sensitive source
noted that a number of Libyans destroyed the furniture in the main waiting room and attacked the consulate.
The Magariaf Government has assured the Egyptian ambassador that additional security personnel will be
assigned to guard the Embassy, at least until the visa backlog is reduced.

This is about Sri Lankan Govt and the Tigers...
I have a good source.
This was shared to me at my and Karen's Derby Party yesterday (can you
believe the 50 to 1 odds winner?).
There was a meeting held with Geitner asked for and led by IMF... They
told him you were intruding into his domain by ordering/telling IMF to
suspend funding to Sri Lakan Govt.

My take is that the people on the ground both with World Bank and IMF
believe the Tigers need to be completely defeated and any collateral
damage inflicted on private people by SL govt in process is ok... They
also believe Tigers are better at propaganda than SL govt...
I have no idea what reality is... I know all about the conflict because
there's been so much written over time but no idea of reality on ground.
My point is that IMF/World Bank is hoping to get Geitner to intervene
and they recently played to his sense of who is US point person on
IMF... So, that's what I know. I'll keep my ears open.

Internet can help free US reporters in NKorea: Clinton
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Monday urged women students to use the Internet to campaign for the release
of two American women journalists held in North Korea. Clinton urged graduates of Barnard College, a women's
university in New York City, to show their opposition to Pyongyang's detention of the two journalists who are due to go
on trial on June 4.
"We have two young women journalists right now imprisoned in North Korea and you can get busy on the Internet and
let the North Koreans know that we find that absolutely unacceptable," Clinton told the graduation ceremony.
Clinton was highlighting the new media tools that women can use to fight injustice around the world.
North Korea announced last Thursday that it had set a June 4 trial date for the two journalists — Euna Lee, a Korean-
American, and Laura Ling, a Chinese-American — but gave no details of the charges against them.
Clinton said afterward that the announcement of a trial date is "a signal that there can be" a resolution of the case soon,
even though she said the pair should be released immediately and the charges against them are "baseless."
The North has previously said they would go on trial for "hostile acts" and illegally entering the country. Their trial would
be held "on the basis of the confirmed crimes committed by them," it has announced.
While working on a story about refugees fleeing the hardline communist North, the pair were detained March 17 along
the narrow Tumen River which marks the border with China.

The 31-Year-Old in Charge of Dismantling G.M. By DAVID E. SANGER
WASHINGTON — It is not every 31-year-old who, in a first government job, finds himself dismantling General Motors
and rewriting the rules of American capitalism.
But that, in short, is the job description for Brian Deese, a not-quite graduate of Yale Law School who had never set foot
in an automotive assembly plant until he took on his nearly unseen role in remaking the American automotive industry.
Nor, for that matter, had he given much thought to what ailed an industry that had been in decline ever since he was
born. A bit laconic and looking every bit the just-out-of-graduate-school student adjusting to life in the West Wing —
"he's got this beard that appears and disappears," says Steven Rattner, one of the leaders of President Obama's
automotive task force — Mr. Deese was thrown into the auto industry's maelstrom as soon the election-night parties
ended.
"There was a time between Nov. 4 and mid-February when I was the only full-time member of the auto task force," Mr.
Deese, a special assistant to the president for economic policy, acknowledged recently as he hurried between his desk at
the White House and the Treasury building next door. "It was a little scary."
But now, according to those who joined him in the middle of his crash course about the automakers' downward spiral,
he has emerged as one of the most influential voices in what may become President Obama's biggest experiment yet in
federal economic intervention.
While far more prominent members of the administration are making the big decisions about Detroit, it is Mr. Deese
who is often narrowing their options.
A month ago, when the administration was divided over whether to support Fiat's bid to take over much of Chrysler, it
was Mr. Deese who spoke out strongly against simply letting the company go into liquidation, according to several
people who were present for the debate.
"Brian grasps both the economics and the politics about as quickly as I've seen anyone do this," said Lawrence H.
Summers, the head of the National Economic Council who is not known for being patient whenever he believes an
analysis is sub-par — or disagrees with his own. "And there he was in the Roosevelt Room, speaking up vigorously to
make the point that the costs we were going to incur giving Fiat a chance were no greater than some of the hidden costs
of liquidation."
Mr. Deese was not the only one favoring the Fiat deal, but his lengthy memorandum on how liquidation would increase
Medicaid costs, unemployment insurance and municipal bankruptcies ended the debate. The administration supported

the deal, and it seems likely to become a reality on Monday, if a federal judge handling the high-speed bankruptcy
proceeding approves the sale of Chrysler's best assets to the Italian carmaker.
Mr. Deese's role is unusual for someone who is neither a formally trained economist nor a business school graduate, and
who never spent much time flipping through the endless studies about the future of the American and Japanese auto
industries.
He lives a dual life these days. He starts the day at a desk wedged just outside of Mr. Summers's office, where he can
hear what young members of the economic team have come to know as "the Summers bellow." From there, he can
make it quickly to the press office to help devise explanations for whytaxpayers are spending more than $50 billion on
what polls show is a very unpopular bailout of the auto industry.
Several times a day he speed-walks to Treasury, taking a shortcut through the tunnel under the colonnade, near the
kitchens. The other day he talked about how sharply perceptions of the industry's future changed after Mr. Obama's
election.
"At the first meeting with Rick Wagoner," he said, referring to G.M.'s recently deposed chief executive, "they were in a
very different place. He said publicly that bankruptcy was not a viable option. It's been a long process getting everyone
to look at the options differently."
In fact, from before Inauguration Day, few in Mr. Obama's circle saw any other choice. Every time Mr. Deese ran the
numbers on G.M. and Chrysler, he came back with the now-obvious conclusion that neither was a viable business, and
that their plans to revive themselves did not address the erosion of their revenues. But it took the support of Mr.
Rattner and Ron Bloom, senior advisers to the task force charged with restructuring the automobile industry, to help
turn Mr. Deese's positions into policy.
"The president's instruction to us was that we had to come up with a solution that would work on a commercial basis,
that didn't involve indefinite federal financing," Mr. Deese said. "But we didn't want liquidation, which would have even
worse effects. So the question was how do you design a very substantial restructuring, and do it fast."
Mr. Deese's route to the auto table at the White House was anything but a straight line. He is the son of a political
science professor at Boston College (his father) and an engineer who works in renewable energy (his mother). He grew
up in the Boston suburb of Belmont and attended Middlebury College in Vermont. He went to Washington to work on
aid issues and was quickly hired by Nancy Birdsall, a widely respected authority on the effectiveness of international aid
and the founder of the Center for Global Development.
But he wanted to learn domestic issues as well, and soon ended up working as an assistant for Gene Sperling, who 17
years ago in the Clinton White House played a similar role as economic policy prodigy. Eventually, Mr. Deese headed to
Yale for his law degree. But his e-mail box was constantly filled with messages from friends in Washington who were
signing up to work for the Obama or Hillary Rodham Clinton campaigns. Mr. Deese chose Senator Clinton's.
"He was pretty quickly functioning as the top economic policy staffer through her campaign," Mr. Sperling said. "He
could blend the policy needs and the political needs pretty seamlessly." On the day that the Clinton campaign ended,
Mr. Deese left her concession speech and received a message on his BlackBerry from a friend in the Obama campaign
urging him to sign on immediately to Mr. Obama's team.
He resumed his policy work there, and found himself stuck in Chicago — unable to fly to Washington with his dog — as
the economic crisis deepened. Finally, one night, he decided to get into his car with his dog and just started driving back
to Washington. Tired, he pulled over to catch some sleep in the car.

"I slept in the parking lot of the G. M. plant in Lordstown, Ohio," he recalled. The giant plant, opened during G.M.'s
heyday in the mid-1960s, is where the Pontiac 65 is produced. Under the plan Mr. Deese worked on when he arrived in
Washington, Pontiac will disappear.
"I guess that was prophetic," he said, shaking his head.

International Development.

I hope you can enlist Hilary's support (and please give her my personal best). We need, for many reasons, to have the
US protest and condemn this outrageous boycott and to oppose the anti-Semitism inherent in it; cf Durban. The
organizers of the festival must be convinced to reverse themselves. This, because of the inherent wrongness of it and
that if it succeeds, it will encourage and motivate those who fomented the boycott to other, probably even worse,
action. For example, there is in effect or pending (I am not certain which) a UK-Israeli treaty on film production; we
should cut off at the pass any attempts to derail it.
Our Embassy in London does not yet have our Ambassador. The charge d'affaires is Robert Lebaron who I hope will

compare Durban.
This is truly appalling and serious and I earnestly solicit your assistance with the Secretary, and through you my earnest

Edinburgh film festival bows to pressure from Ken Loach over Israeli boycott
Mike Wade
A row threatened to engulf the Edinburgh International Film Festival yesterday after it bowed to pressure from the
director Ken Loach and returned a £300 grant it had received from the Israeli Embassy.
Sir Jeremy Isaacs, the former chief executive of Channel Four, accused the festival's organisers of making "an appalling
decision" and called on them to rescind it. Describing Loach's intervention as an act of censorship, he said: "They must
not allow someone who has no real position, no rock to stand on, to interfere with their programming."

The grant was intended to enable Tali Shalom Ezer, a graduate of Tel Aviv University, to travel to Scotland for a
screening of her film, Surrogate.
After days of protest against the award from pro-Palestinian organisations, Loach, an outspoken opponent of Israel's
policies in Lebanon and Gaza, urged filmgoers on Monday to boycott Edinburgh.
"The massacres and state terrorism in Gaza make this money unacceptable," he said. "With regret, I must urge all who
might consider visiting the festival to show their support for the Palestinian nation and stay away."
The intervention brought an immediate capitulation from the organisers. In a statement the festival said it accepted that
Loach spoke "on behalf of the film community, therefore we will be returning the funding issued by the Israeli Embassy".
Sir Jeremy said that he was disgusted both by Loach's actions and by the capitulation of the festival organisers. "Ken
Loach has always been critical of censorship of his own work, albeit it was many years in the past. The idea that he
should lend himself to the denial of a film-maker's right to show her work is absolutely appalling," he said. He was
"equally horrified" that festival organisers should accept that Loach was speaking on behalf of all British film-makers.
Sir Jeremy worked closely with Loach in the 1980s when, as chief executive of Channel Four, he commissioned a number
of controversial documentaries from him. One, A Question of Leadership, was made in 1981 but never broadcast,
leading to accusations of political censorship from Loach. The irony of the director's present position was all the more
obvious, given the spirit of the Edinburgh festival, Sir Jeremy said.
"It must be good for cinemagoers at an international film festival to see films by Jews, Arabs, Israelis and Palestinians, to
the benefit of all," he said.
"I have admired the Edinburgh International Film Festival for many years and would like to think that this appalling
decision will be rescinded."
Loach's acclaimed new film Looking for Eric has made him the toast of the Cannes Film Festival. It is, uncharacteristically,
a comedy, although its lead character is an authentic Loach creation — a Mancunian postman who goes off in search of
his idol, the footballer Eric Cantona.
Ezer's film makes no reference to war or politics. It is a romance set in a sex-therapy clinic. It woni the audience award at
an international women's film festival in Israel recently.
Lord Janner of Braunstone, a Labour peer and former chairman of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said that he was
disappointed by the festival's decision. "By banning the Israeli Embassy from supporting a film-maker the festival is
helping to exclude Israelis from British cultural life, something that is clearly unfair."
Last night a spokesman for the EIFF said that although it had returned E300 to the Israeli Embassy, the festival itself
would fund Ms Shalom-Ezer's travel to Edinburgh out of its own budget

Here is the situation as I understand it.
The film festival returned funds that it had received from the Israeli Embassy, after protests from some UK film figures
(Ken Loach) and Palestinian solidarity groups.
The Israeli director is now being funded directly by the festival.
The organizers issued a sort of apology today.
We have not been able to locate any State Dept response to similar episodes in the past (Israeli academics disinvited to
a British conference).

The Settlements Facts •
By Daniel Kurtzer
Sunday, June 14, 2009
Faulty analysis of the Israeli settlement issue is being passed off as fact. Charles Krauthanuner's June 5 column,
"The Settlements Myth," is one example.
Here are the facts: In 2003, the Israeli government accepted, with some reservations, the "road map" for peace,
which imposed two requirements on Israel regarding settlements: "GO! [Government of Israel] immediately
dismantles settlement outposts erected since March 2001. Consistent with the Mitchell Report, GOI freezes all
settlement activity (including natural growth of settlements)."
Today, Israel maintains that three events -- namely, draft understandings discussed in 2003 between Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon and U.S. deputy national security adviser Stephen Hadley; President George W. Bush's
April 14, 2004, letter to Sharon; and an April 14 letter from Sharon adviser Dov Weissglas to national security
adviser Condoleezza Rice -- constitute a formal understanding in which the United States accepted continuing
Israeli building within the "construction line" of settlements. The problem is that there was no such
understanding.
The first event the Israelis cite is the 2003 discussions on a four-part draft that included the notion that
construction within settlements might be permitted if confined to the already built-up areas of the settlements.
The idea was to draw a line around the outer perimeter of built-up areas in settlements and to allow building
only inside that line. This draft was never codified, and no effort was made then to define the line around the
built-up areas of settlements. Nonetheless, Israel began to act largely in accordance with its own reading of
these provisions, probably believing that U.S. silence conferred assent.
Second, President Bush's 2004 letter conveyed U.S. support of an agreed outcome of negotiations in which
Israel would retain "existing major Israeli population centers" in the West Bank "on the basis of mutually
agreed changes. . . ." One of the key provisions of this letter was that U.S. support for Israel's retaining some
settlements was predicated on there being an "agreed outcome" of negotiations. Despite Israel's contention that
this letter allowed it to continue building in the large settlement blocs of Ariel, Maale Adumim and Gush
Etzion, the letter did not convey any U.S. support for or understanding of Israeli settlement activities in these or
other areas in the run-up to a peace agreement.
In his 2004 letter to Rice, Weissglas addressed the issue of the "construction line," saying that "within the
agreed principles of settlement activities, an effort will be made in the next few days to have a better definition
of the construction line of settlements in Judea & Samaria." However, there never were any "agreed principles
of settlement activities." Moreover, the effort to define the "construction line" was never consummated: Israel
and the United States discussed briefly but did not reach agreement on the definition of the construction line of

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762349 Date: 06/30/2015
settlements. Weissglas's letter also promised "continuous action" to remove all the unauthorized outposts, but
Israel removed almost none of them.
Throughout this period, the Bush administration did not regularly protest Israel's continuing settlement activity.
But this is very different from arguing that the United States agreed with it. In recent days, former senior Bush
administration officials have told journalists on background that no understandings existed with Israel regarding
continued settlement activity.
Commentators also focus on the Obama administration's reiteration that a freeze must include the "natural
growth" of settlements. Krauthammer says that this "means strangling to death the thriving towns close to the
1949 armistice line. . . It means no increase in population. Which means no babies." This is nonsense. No one
suggests that Israelis stop having babies. Rather, the blessing of a new baby does not translate into a right to
build more apartments or houses in settlements. The two issues have nothing to do with each other. Israelis, like
Americans, move all the time when life circumstances -- children, jobs, housing availability -- change.
The pattern of population growth in the territories actually undercuts the natural-growth argument. Since 1993,
when Israel signed the Oslo Accords, Israel's West Bank settler population has grown from 116,300 to 289,600.
The numbers in East Jerusalem increased from 152,800 to more than 186,000. This goes far beyond the natural
increase of families already living in the settlements. Inserting the provision of "natural growth" in official
documents started with the 2001 Mitchell Report and the 2003 "road map," reflecting recognition that the
concept was being abused as a justification for expanding settlements. The Obama administration is pursuing
policies that every administration since 1967 has articulated -- that settlements jeopardize the possibility of
achieving peace and thus settlement activity should stop. This does not diminish the Palestinians'
responsibilities, especially their commitment to stop violence and terrorism and uproot terrorist infrastructure.
President Obama emphasized this in his Cairo speech. But Palestinian failures in no" way justify Israeli failure to
implement their road map commitments with respect to settlements and outposts. It is time for Israel to freeze
all settlement activity and dismantle the unauthorized outposts.

Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.

Kyrgyzstan rejects Obama "cooperation" offer
U.S. President Obama has sent a personal appeal to Kyrgyzstan proposing ways to discuss "expanding cooperation".
Kyrgyzstan will not reverse its decision to close a U.S. military air base which is used to supply American troops for
Afghanistan occupation, Kyrgyz Foreign Minister Kadyrbek Sarbayev said on Thursday. U.S. President Barack Obama
has sent a personal appeal to Kyrgyzstan proposing ways to discuss "expanding cooperation".
But Bakiyev's office said in a statement it had received a letter from Obama praising bilateral relations. "Moreover,
Barack Obama expressed hope to further strengthen various forms of cooperation between the United States and
Kyrgyzstan," the statement said without mentioning the air base issue. "The decision to annul all agreements on the
Manes military air base has been taken and there is no turning back on this," he told the 24.kg news agency.

While it has improved, it has also grown in length. It is now just a bit shorter than your Senate confirmation

Tom backgrounded them yesterday in the briefing room, not certain but don't think he put down any groundwork on
this specifically.
But in terms of setting expectations it would be a combo of a few overt and not overt things:
- Seeing what Admin/For Pol Members of Congress are on TV today and the shows tomorrow, all we need is one person
to float it.
- We have flight time tomorrow when Tom & Jake can do it on background or OTR.
- There's one blogger that folks loosely follow, I know how to get her something through a 3rd party.
- I have to talk to a few of our guys today like Matt Lee on misc stuff, and I'm sure he'll ask me something about the OAS
where I can easily say the folks in WHA are real pessimistic. And our travelers traffic info among themselves. The best
thing to put out there would be the notion that there are those who don't think you should go. If you don't, you don't.
But if you do, you chose to be direct, to make a principled stand.
Shouldn't be too tough, because the notion of Cuba being voted in is something they will WANT to believe, it'll make
good copy. And it makes it easier to explain any decision/outcome

Below is the statement of very impressive Palau reps at the end of a session of required meetings on the next phase of
free association aid. FYI only, the Palauans were insulted by the nature and depth of the response to their proposal as
well as the content and the overall approach. They are even privately questioning the relationship. (This hasn't affected
their intent to take the Uighurs.) I will send a few further thoughts.
At the conclusion of yesterday's meeting, the Palau delegation caucused to discuss its reaction to the response of the
United States delegation to the proposals that it made in June in Washington D.C., and expanded upon in subsequent
communications.
While the Palau delegation has agreed to respond to certain additional questions raised by the United States delegation
on specific elements of the Palau proposal, and further has agreed to participate in certain working groups on specific
issues, the Palau delegation was deeply disappointed with the response of the United States delegation. The United
States delegation did not seriously respond, as required by the Compact, to the operational requirements of the
Government of Palau or to Palau's comprehensive and considered plans to achieve economic advancement and self-
sufficiency.
In light of the foregoing, the Palau delegation has determined that it must now return to Palau to discuss with President
Toribiong the next steps that Palau needs to take regarding the Compact. Thank you.

As the conversation with these two ministers unfold, you might make the point that we have come a LONG way
on Cuba so far -- and it would be really unfortunate to jam or embarrass President Obama after all the steps he's
taken, especially since what we are seeking is an entirely reasonable result.
Agreeing to lift the 1962 sanction is a BIG step.

As the conversation with these two ministers unfold, you might make the point that we have come a LONG way on Cuba
so far -- and it would be really unfortunate to jam or embarrass President Obama after all the steps he's taken, especially
since what we are seeking is an entirely reasonable result.
Agreeing to lift the 1962 sanction is a BIG step.

In other news, one of the major loyalist paramilitaries announced its full disarmament today -- we're getting out a

I addressed this with Lippert when we last had an issue.
Our identified point of contact is Sarah Farnsworth and we talk to her regularly. I will call and find out what happened
but this meeting was confirmed. They are not telling us when things get canceled and I think we need another contact
there if sarah is too overwhelmed.

OK. Went through it. It's not too much shorter, but I think it's tighter here and there. Made slight change at
end to try to tie in with how it started to bring full circle.
An area where you could save time and space (but I didn't try to change it) would be to shorten the parts where
you talk about Israel and Palestine and about Iraq and Afghanistan - it seems to me that those are tactical
discussions of an existing issue, and somewhat removed from the more abstract and strategic policy outline
she's otherwise aiming at here.
By the way, the phrase "global network of diverse partnerships" seems to be absent now. I kind of liked it on
several levels, but I presume it met some objection along the way...

evening. President Zelaya addresses the General Assembly tomorrow morning at 11:00 am, so USUN needs to be
instructed this evening.
The bureaus are happy to co-sponsor, as long as the resolution stays substantively the same. The draft text is below:

Jake, when you can, I think I speak for the group when I say that we'd like and After Action Report on last night's date
with Dr. Senkler - especially curious if your plan to transition from the initial expanded group to a more restricted
bilateral meeting worked as planned.
And while I'm writing, here is about the most straightforward piece about HRC ever written in the NY Times - with this
classic line: "...a Liberian man with a long wooden horn followed her around most of the visit, blowing out loud funny
noises whenever she said something striking."
Clinton Ends Africa Tour, Vowing to Stay Involved
By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN
The New York Times
Published: August 15, 2009
SANTA MARIA, Cape Verde - After a grueling seven-nation, 11-day trip, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton
wrapped up her Africa tour on Friday by reaffirming her promise to renovate American relations with the continent.
"I leave Africa after this remarkable trip even more committed," Mrs. Clinton said before leaving Cape Verde.
"I have seen the joy and energy Africans have, evidenced not just by the boogieing, but by the hard work and
perseverance," she said, referring to a recent comment from her husband, former President Bill Clinton, that she knew
how to "boogie" with African dancers.
"And we've seen the worst humanity can do to itself," she added, presumably referring to Congo, where Mrs. Clinton
met victims of a brutal civil war that just does not seem to end.

Mrs. Clinton seemed satisfied that she had accomplished her mission: strengthening American relations with crucial
allies on the continent, like Nigeria and South Africa, and sending a message of "tough love," as she called it, to nations
like Kenya and Congo.
Over all, she said, the United States wants to work more closely with African nations as a partner, not simply as a patron
or dispenser of aid. In exchange, she said, African leaders must deliver democracy and good government.
Mrs. Clinton vowed to stay on top of Africa, even after she gets back to Washington, closely monitoring the issues she
addressed on her tour. She also pointed to Cape Verde, a set of palm-studded islands best known for their beaches and
enormous tourist hotels, as an example of what good leadership can do.
"This is possible," she said. "You create not just economic growth but a sense of human dignity and possibility."
Kenya. South Africa. Angola. Congo. Nigeria. Liberia. And finally Cape Verde. Mrs. Clinton saw with her own eyes some of
Africa's most promising countries - and some of its most troubled ones. In Kenya, she pushed for the government to
prosecute perpetrators of the postelection violence last year. In South Africa, the big issue was Zimbabwe and how the
South African government should do more to help ease the crisis there.
In Angola, the theme was good governing practices and oil, a strategic concern of the United States given the many
inroads China has made there and elsewhere in Africa in its hunger for natural resources. In Congo, Mrs. Clinton was
passionate about the need to end the nation's rape epidemic.
"The secretary's visit to the heart of the world's deadliest war zone in eastern Congo was a potential game-changer for
that conflict," said John Prendergast, a founder of the Washington-based Enough project. "Her commitment to
addressing root causes such as the conflict minerals that power our electronics industry was a refreshing contrast to the
usual disaster sympathy tourism of visiting dignitaries."
"Now," he added, "comes the hard part: making good on the promises and living up to the high expectations
engendered by her visit."
In Nigeria, Mrs. Clinton pressed for electoral changes. In Liberia, she praised the country's president, Ellen Johnson
Sirleaf, the only woman in Africa to be elected head of state.
The Liberian visit had a special warmth, almost like a meeting of long-lost cousins. Liberia was founded in the 19th
century by freed American slaves, and the country's flag, the people's names and even the police uniforms with plastic-
brimmed hats were all reminiscent of the American versions. Mrs. Clinton received possibly her most exuberant
welcome there, and a Liberian man with a long wooden horn followed her around most of the visit, blowing out loud
funny noises whenever she said something striking.
"I love that - the horn - I want to take that guy with me wherever I go," she said.
In Cape Verde, Mrs. Clinton seemed to have few bones to pick. For once, she said, she had a cheat sheet on a country
that included a list of far more positives than negatives. The country has fewer than 500,000 people and has escaped the
turmoil that has engulfed so much of Africa. The all-inclusive, poolside buffet resorts here feel like something found in
Cancun or the Bahamas.
Mrs. Clinton called Cape Verde "a model of democracy and economic progress in Africa."
On Friday, just as she had at every stop, she started her speech by saying, "I bring you greetings from President Obama."
She called him a "son of Africa" and said that under the Obama administration, the United States was determined to
help Africa reach its promise.

Subject: Palau offended by US positions
Below is the statement of very impressive Palau reps at the end of a session of required meetings on the next phase of
free association aid. FYI only, the Palauans were insulted by the nature and depth of the response to their proposal as
well as the content and the overall approach. They are even privately questioning the relationship. (This hasn't affected
their intent to take the Uighurs.) I will send a few further thoughts.
At the conclusion of yesterday's meeting, the Palau delegation caucused to discuss its reaction to the response of the
United States delegation to the proposals that it made in June in Washington D.C., and expanded upon in subsequent
communications.
While the Palau delegation has agreed to respond to certain additional questions raised by the United States delegation
on specific elements of the Palau proposal, and further has agreed to participate in certain working groups on specific
issues, the Palau delegation was deeply disappointed with the response of the United States delegation. The United
States delegation did not seriously respond, as required by the Compact, to the operational requirements of the
Government of Palau or to Palau's comprehensive and considered plans to achieve economic advancement and self-
sufficiency.
In light of the foregoing, the Palau delegation has determined that it must now return to Palau to discuss with President
Toribiong the next steps that Palau needs to take regarding the Compact. Thank you. .

I spoke with both Kurt and Jeff about Jim's paper on Dai, which Huma has. Both were very impressed but had a number
of substantive thoughts.
They would cast the point in a different way,
which they are thinking through.
Kurt says that he will talk to Jim and then perhaps provide his own thoughts in a paper to you.
Meanwhile, I have asked Derek to do something resembling "debate on a page," to distill the key points and objectives
into a single short document that can serve as a cribsheet and help you avoid the crushing burden of the paper in the
binder.
We are prepared to keep refining and improving the paper thru the weekend.

Subject: Freedom of Expression - UN Human Rights
Jake,
I wanted to update you on two aspects of our work leading up to the September session at the UN Human
Rights Council where the U.S. will be a full member for the first time: 1) freedom of expression (addressed in
this email) and 2) human rights strategy at the UN (in a second email on high side).
First, I'd like to let you know about the successful next step in a strategy we are pursuing at the UN Human
Rights Council to begin to change the dialogue on Freedom of Expression. We think we have developed a
well-balanced text that we can move forward to adoption in the UN HRC's September session. This work
contributes to our long-term effort to improve this UN body. Progress on this issue would help us later as we
address the even more difficult issue of the "defamation of religions" about which the Secretary expressed
interest in a Monday senior staff meeting.
An 10-DRL-L-NEA group has been working together to implement the strategy that involves reaching
agreement with the Egyptians on a text that we will roll out late next week with countries in the OIC
(Organization of the Islamic Conference) and the WEOG (Western European and Other Group, our regional
group at the UN).
Experts in L, DRL, 10, and NEA agree that the text protects all USG red lines and offers us a workable
compromise that can secure genuine cross-regional consensus when presented in the Human Rights Council in
September, hopefully avoiding a divisive vote on this issue. US and Egyptian teams also agreed to the
possibility of further cooperation in the UNGA to come to a soft landing on defamation of religions if Cairo and
Washington first succeed in passing the FoE resolution by OIC/WEOG consensus.

REF: A. STATE 86734

1.(SBU) This is an action request, see paras 4 - 6.
2.(SBU) On August 14, the USG and Colombian government
provisionally agreed ad referendum to the text of a
bilateral Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA) (septel).
We expect the final agreement may be signed in Bogota in
about a month, following a final review by both sides. As
noted in reftels, the DCA would permit the United States
access to several Colombian military bases and facilitate
effective bilateral cooperation on security matters in
Colombia. It would not/not authorize establishment of any
U.S. bases or ports, nor would it result in an overall
increase in the number of U.S. military personnel or

Jaime Bermudez met in Washington to discuss the DCA,
including the importance of coordinating our public
affairs and diplomatic strategies (septel to follow).
There is some concern that the upcoming Union of South
American Nations (UNASUR) summit would become a regional
referendum on the DCA. Colombian President Alvaro Uribe
will attend the summit provided that a full range of
regional security matters can be discussed, not just the
DCA. In this context, we are reaching out to selected
UNASUR members to ask that they raise other regional
security issues beyond the DCA.
4. (SBU) Action requested for Santiago, Asuncion, and
Lima: that you find an opportunity prior to the August 28
summit to raise the importance of discussing the full
range of regional security topics during the summit, and
not merely the DCA, with appropriate high levels of host
government.

UNASUR member states deliver the attached letter from the
Secretary to host governments in advance of the August 28

6. (U) Begin text:
Dear Madam/Mr. Minister:
I wanted to take a moment to write to you and your
colleagues about the upcoming summit of the Union of South
American Nations (UNASUR), scheduled for August 28 in
Bariloche. UNASUR provides an important forum to address
the issues and challenges that affect the region. The
United States supports the formation and effective
functioning of regional groups such as UNASUR. They
promote stability, cohesion, and leadership on key issues,
and ensure the best possible communication between
nations.
As you know, our common neighbor,
Colombia, has faced an ongoing threat from an unholy
alliance of terrorist groups funded by the insidious
illegal narcotics trade. These terrorists have threatened
the security of average Colombians and sought to overthrow
by violence and corruption successive,
democratically-elected Colombian governments. The actions
of these groups also threaten the security of other
countries in the hemisphere, sometimes directly, in many
ways indirectly. Over the last decade, Colombians have
beat back this threat, to the benefit of us all. My
country is proud of the role we have been able to play in
this effort.
This battle is far from won. Our governments and people
are collectively forced to find ways to protect ourselves
and our institutions from such threats. I am certain
these very issues will be addressed at the upcoming
summit, including the recently concluded Defense
Cooperation Agreement (DCA). We understand the
sensitivities associated with U.S. military activities in
the hemisphere and the questions your government may have
regarding the scope and extent of this agreement. I hope
the efforts made in the last few weeks by both my
government and the Colombian government have helped
address those questions.
I would like to take this opportunity to make several key
points about the DCA. First, this agreement is a
bilateral agreement with Colombia to deepen our
cooperation on security challenges within Colombia,
permitting U.S. access to specified agreed Colombian

facilities to undertake mutually agreed activities on
Colombian territory. It is a bilateral agreement that
does not pose any threat or risk for the citizens of other
nations. On the contrary, our mutual efforts to combat
drug trafficking benefit the security of the region as a
whole. The agreement does not permit the establishment of
U.S. bases in Colombia. It will not result in an increase
in the U.S. military presence in Colombia, and we do not
seek any such increase. Activities undertaken at or from
Colombian bases by U.S. persons will be coordinated in
advance by Colombian authorities. All activities will be
based on full respect for the principles of sovereignty,
territorial integrity of states, and
non-interventionism.
We are committed to being as forthcoming as possible in
addressing concerns about this bilateral agreement with
nations in the region, and we have endeavored to do so in
recent weeks through a variety of mechanisms. As concerns
or questions arise, I hope that you will feel free to
reach out to us to seek clarification.
The UNASUR summit provides a unique opportunity for the
organization to address a range of security issues that
affect the hemisphere, and I salute your leadership for
deciding to discuss these matters. The security
challenges affecting our hemisphere, and your nations in
particular, are pressing and grave. Our firm belief is
that a collective and collaborative approach to these
matters is essential. It is our commitment to work with
UNASUR nations to help address these concerns.
Sincerely yours,
Hillary Rodham Clinton

Subject: Demarche on UNGA redlines
FYI: We will send today for your review and approval a demarche describing the circumstances in which the U.S. would
walk out of speeches at the UN General Assembly and asking countries to join us in the walkout. Note that we are
differing from past practice when we simply did not have anyone in the U.S. seat during speeches by certain countries.
This year an appropriate-level individual will be behind the U.S. placard for all speeches and will remain unless these
redlines are crossed.
This demarche is going out to EU member state capitals, as well as Oslo, Reykjavik, Ottawa, Canberra, Wellington, Tokyo,
Seoul, Buenos Aires, Bogota, San Jose, and Montevideo. USUN asks that our posts deliver the demarche in advance of an
EU political directors meeting on this issue in New York Monday morning our time.
The background portion of the cable, which discusses EU internal dynamics on this issue, is classified, but the
unclassified talking points will come to you for your review.

Re: Berlin speeches
Below are my notes for speeches in Berlin. The themes I stress are these: the importance of Berlin and the
Brandenburg Gate as symbols of freedom; the weight of history (always felt by Germans); the contribution of
the US and the salience of the Western alliance; the meaning of 1989 to today and especially the continuity of
the Western alliance; and segue from past to future.
What I have not done here but might be added are references to Angela Merkel (a courageous woman from the
east who embodies the highest values of the West); and specific policies. Those can be fitted in.
So, some ideas and language:
Twenty years ago the wall fell. Here, in Berlin, the moment when tens of thousands of citizens tore it down with
hammers and picks and bare hands is called "Die Wende," a phrase that means more than simply a change but a
turning point in history. It was not only a turning point for Germany and Europe but also for the United States
because the wall—the reason for its construction and the reason for its destruction—is central to our common
history—and to our common future.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765211 Date: 07/31/2015
Richard von Weizsaecker said, "As long as the Brandenburg Gate is closed, the German question will remain
open." Today I can say with finality, the German question is closed, because the Brandenburg Gate is wide
open! The gate is open, Europe is open, and our future together is open.
In the forty years from the Berlin airlift to the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Atlantic partnership proved itself the
most successful alliance for freedom in history. That alliance was, is and shall be the crowning achievement of
American foreign policy. And the German — American relationship has always served as its foundation. Our
alliance represents the reconciliation of former enemies, an inspiration to other peoples and continents
devastated by war and hatred, and it must never be taken for granted.
In the twenty years since the fall of the wall we have created architecture for an enduring peace. Instead of a
wall we have built a gateway to the future. President Kennedy said in 1963 that in the future free men
everywhere will say, "Ich bin ein Berliner." Today Berlin has gained a new and even more powerful meaning.
Forever into the future, the opening of this Gate will be the symbol of the return of the dream of freedom, not
only to Berlin and Germany, but to the entire world.
The Gate, we must remember, was not built as a symbol of freedom. And each of the tyrannies that used the
Gate as a symbol believed it represented their eternal power. The Gate was first erected as a symbol against the
French Revolution; then it became a symbol of the imperial ambitions of Napoleon who marched his army
through. It was a symbol of Prussian militarism and monarchy. It was seized by the Nazi Party as the symbol of
its 1000 year rule. And then it became a symbol of the Communist totalitarianism that built a wall to separate
the people of Berlin as though freedom could be contained in only one part of the city. Here, in Berlin, the Cold
War was coldest.
We celebrate the fact that the wall that marred this proud city was taken down by the world's most enthusiastic
wrecking crew. The United States always believed in the freedom of Berlin because we believed in the future of
freedom. The courageous citizens of East Germany, Poland and other nations of the Communist bloc
demonstrated their dedication to free and peaceful solution of conflicts through their stand against dictatorship.
America stood resolutely as an ally at every moment of this struggle and moved swiftly to help the peoples of
Europe reunite after 1989.
We celebrate the steadiness of purpose, the restraint and respect for ultimate goals that allowed the Cold War to
end in peace. For how the victory was won was essential to the triumph. 1989 was special. It was that rarest of
historical events: a revolution that did not descend into violence. As a result the Gate survives not as a
cautionary monument to history's darkest moments but to its brightest. Today we celebrate the revolution of
1989, the turning point that transformed the Brandenburg Gate into the symbol of the hope of democracy and
the promise of freedom.
Berliner Luft, the air of Berlin, has always been unique. I can feel and smell the spirit of freedom in your
streets. The great American poet Carl Sandburg called Berlin the Chicago of Europe. Chicago is where I was
born and raised. I can sense the same energy, openness and dedication to hard work in both great cities. Another
Chicagoan, President Barack Obama, was drawn to Berlin last July, a city that he said made him feel like a
citizen of the world and a citizen of the future.
I was very proud to visit our new Embassy at the Brandenburg Gate, located exactly where the Wall used to
run. Our presence here will forever underscore our determination that the spark of freedom from this city in
1989 will help light the torches of freedom throughout the world.
The revolution of 1989 did not mark the end of history. Having made history together, we are summoned to
secure freedom for future generations. As vital at the beginning of the 21' century as it was in the last half of
the 20th, the Western alliance is called to new tasks. The dreams of 1989 reached far—and have farther to
reach. Old hatreds and conflicts—in the Balkins, the Caucauses, in the Middle East, East Asia, and Africa—still

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765211 Date: 07/31/2015
simmer. We have much to demonstrate what we have learned from the last century. Without freedom, without
the rule of law, without the opportunity for people to support themselves and their families — without basic
human rights-- anger, aggression and violence will prevail.
Today we are faced with difficult and often dangerous conflicts arising not from conflicts between nations but
within them, conflicts exploited by zealots who make the false claim that violence will purify the world and
open the gates of heaven. Once zealots tried to use this Gate to symbolize that message. But through the
courage and determination of the people of Berlin and their stalwart allies, this Gate now stands for a true
revolution of the spirit. The long twilight struggle to tear down this wall to make Europe whole and free inspires
us, in this new century, to help other peoples gain the same measure of security, respect and progress.
We need Berlin more than ever today. We need your courage, your fortitude, your commitment to the rights of
men—and women—we need your example. We are hardly at the end of the history of the West. Standing here,
where a wall once stood but is no more, in the light from the Gate, we have learned from history's deepest
lessons. Our alliance, linked by shared struggle, dedicated to the ideals of freedom and democracy, strong from
the world we have built, now faces a new world of challenges. And we are ready to meet and conquer them. We
know it has been done before. We are free men—and women—and proud to say, We are all Berliners.

the torches of freedom throughout the world.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765213 Date: 07/31/2015
The revolution of 1989 did not mark the end of history. Having made history together, we are summoned to secure
freedom for future generations. As vital at the beginning of the 21st century as it was in the last half of the 20th, the
Western alliance is called to new tasks. The dreams of 1989 reached far—and have farther to reach. Old hatreds and
conflicts—in the Balkins, the Caucauses, in the Middle East, East Asia, and Africa—still simmer. We have much to
demonstrate what we have learned from the last century. Without freedom, without the rule of law, without the
opportunity for people to support themselves and their families – without basic human rights-- anger, aggression and
violence will prevail.
Today we are faced with difficult and often dangerous conflicts arising not from conflicts between nations but within
them, conflicts exploited by zealots who make the false claim that violence will purify the world and open the gates of
heaven. Once zealots tried to use this Gate to symbolize that message. But through the courage and determination of
the people of Berlin and their stalwart allies, this Gate now stands for a true revolution of the spirit. The long twilight
struggle to tear down this wall to make Europe whole and free inspires us, in this new century, to help other peoples
gain the same measure of security, respect and progress.
We need Berlin more than ever today. We need your courage, your fortitude, your commitment to the rights of men—
and women—we need your example. We are hardly at the end of the history of the West. Standing here, where a wall
once stood but is no more, in the light from the Gate, we have learned from history's deepest lessons. Our alliance,
linked by shared struggle, dedicated to the ideals of freedom and democracy, strong from the world we have built, now
faces a new world of challenges. And we are ready to meet and conquer them. We know it has been done before. We
are free men—and women—and proud to say, We are all Berliners.

Just following up on a few items.
First, see below on Nagorno-Karabakh.
Third, on QME, Gates and Barak are meeting the week of UNGA and we are holding until then if you are comfortable
with that.
Fourth, Declan Kelly is going to be in Belfast Monday and Tuesday with Lou Susman. I will be there Tuesday for all of the
official meetings. Declan and I will stay Tuesday night after Lou leaves and have dinner with a broad cross-section of
folks.
Fifth, I'm working with Holbrooke's and Lew's shops on the materials for Af/Pak, and we'll have a concept paper over
the weekend on the UNGA curtain raiser.
Sixth, Mike Fuchs and I met with Team WHA on Mexico, following up on Carlos' memo. Mike is working with WHA to
ensure that we create a productive agenda and outcomes for the Merida meeting you will participate in at UNGA.
(SBU) Reports about an alleged lethal incident along the line of contact in Nagorno-Karabakh remain
unconfirmed. The potential implications on the peace process are not yet clear. At the moment, regional
leaders are responding cautiously and the impact on other regional processes does not appear
significant. The Armenian Ministry of Defense denied any unusual activity along the line of contact; the
Azerbaijan Ministry of Defense told media that incidents are frequent along the line of contact. Embassy
Yerevan reports that it is customary to deny reports of sniper incidents along the line of contact, but that an
incident of this magnitude would be difficult to cover up. Embassy Baku notes that President Aliyev is in
Kazakhstan and local authorities could be waiting for his return before deciding on how to proceed. Neither of
our Embassies have been able to confirm local media reports.

Brazil signals recognition of Honduran election
(AP) –40 minutes ago
RIO DE JANEIRO —A top Brazilian official has signaled that Latin America's largest nation may recognize the Honduran candidate who won
last weekend's post-coup presidential election.
Dilma Rousseff is chief of staff for Brazilian President Luiz !neck) Lula da Silva. Rousseff says the Central American country's Nov. 29 election
should be considered separately from the June 28 coup that ousted ex-President Manuel Zelaya.
Previously, the government had said it would not recognize the election unless Zelaya was returned to office and allowed to serve out his term,
which ends Jan. 27.
Rousseff told Brazilian television late Friday from Germany that the coup "is one thing" and "discussing the election" another.
She says "this new process" — the election — "has to be considered."

Got a readout from Rich. We still have work to do on the cables, which we'll do at our session with Eikenberry
tomorrow. The July 2011 date was a trouble spot too -- but there is no excuse for that and that got mostly sorted by the
end.
Everything else was good.
My sincere apologies for missing elements of prep today -- I had to deal with some personal stuff that unfortunately
interfered.
Rich and I have organized a session for tomorrow to nail things down with Karl.

Subject Guinea/Madagascar
There are a number of different possibilities for how the decision on the Guinea/Madagascar credentials may go
tomorrow. (It is Zambia and Tanzania bringing the challenge on behalf of the AU.) I was under the impression that we
would not have to vote on the potential credentials challenges. We may have to.
We may have to vote on a motion to *deny* them credentials and exclude them. For the moment, the guidance is to
vote to credential all countries — including these two — as is customary, while conducting outreach with Tanzania,
Zambia, and the AU to exnlain that WP have our own imnpratives hut ma cunnnrt thp fart that they are taking a
principled stand.
We may have to vote on a motion to *defer* decision, which would allow them to be seated and vote but would not
formally grant credentials. For the moment, the guidance is to potentially support such a motion — this was the practice
with respect to South Africa between 1983 and 1994. Everyone is in the same place on this.
Ultimately, however, the whole thing may die of its own weight. This is probably the most likely outcome.

We initialled the text of an Open Skies Agreement with Japan at about 10 tonight. I owe enormous thanks to so many of
you for a true team victory. From Secretary Clinton on the seventh floor to my tireless secretary in EEB, Tucker
Richmond Stewart, we pulled together to make a bit of aviation history and, much more important, to do something
good for our consumers, communities, and national economy.
I was able to contact the offices of about ten key Senators and Members of Congress before the signing, with a focus on
those who, with a strong Delta presence at home, had expressed concerns about proceeding. I stressed that we'd
negotiated provisions that offer Delta assurances of fairness and the potential to grow. I also emphasized that the
decision to proceed was taken only after careful consideration at very senior levels of State, DOT, and White House.
Thanks, again, to all for your support.
John Byerly
With help I'll make more calls next week and will arrange briefings for all who are interested.

Really good editorial here. Really worth reading.
This Week in Copenhagen
December 12, 2009
Editorial
We didn't expect much from the first week of the global warming conference in Copenhagen. Countries need to
do a little posturing before getting down to the hard work, which is supposed to start on Monday. But the
belligerent talk from China seemed to go well beyond the usual positioning.
The best hope is that the talks will produce an interim understanding under which industrialized countries would
commit to fairly precise targets for reduced emissions, and others, like China, to broader but measurable goals.
The industrial countries would be expected to help poorer countries shift to less-polluting forms of energy.
That would set the stage for a legally binding deal in 2010. But there is no chance of even an interim agreement
without the enthusiastic participation of China, the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. China's absence would
give other developing countries — and the United States Senate — an excuse to do less than needed.
Beijing's recent pledge to slow the growth in emissions seemed like a positive shift in attitude. Then on
Tuesday, in a surprising show of defensiveness, China's top negotiator, Su Wei, said the greatest burden rested
with the industrialized countries and jumped on the United States, Japan and the European Union for not being
aggressive enough. Another Chinese official urged Washington to do "some deep soul-searching" and improve
its proposal.
Todd Stern, the chief American negotiator, responded correctly: With emissions in many industrialized
countries peaking or declining, just about all of the growth in greenhouse gases is expected to come from the
developing world between now and 2030, half from China. Rich nations must still reduce emissions sharply,
Mr. Stern said, but "there is no way to solve this problem by giving the major developing countries a pass."

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766084 Date: 08/31/2015
China has also been demanding that rich nations contribute hundreds of millions of dollars a year to help poor
countries address the threat of climate change. Again Mr. Stern was blunt. Washington is prepared to help those
who need it, but given China's huge reserves and revved-up economy, he said he could not envision "public
funds, certainly not from the United States, going to China."
The most positive development has been a pledge by the European Union to contribute $10.5 billion over the
next three years to help poorer countries deal with climate change. The United States has said that it will make a
contribution but has not said how big it will be.
Transparency is another difficult issue that must be resolved, at least in principle, this week. There is no point in
setting targets, or threatening penalties for noncompliance, unless countries are required to report emissions
accurately. Transparency has never been one of Beijing's virtues, and emerging countries generally need aid to
create sophisticated monitoring systems.
Copenhagen's broadest challenge is finding an equitable way to distribute the burden of confronting climate
change. Despite some differences, the industrialized nations have pretty much agreed to trim their emissions by
15 percent to 20 percent from 2005 levels in the next 10 years, and by 80 percent by midcentury. And all seem
to be willing to make expensive investments to get there. President Obama will need help from Congress, no
sure thing.
A host of developing countries — including India, Brazil, Indonesia — have put broad goals on the table,
though in some cases they seem more aspirational than real. But the bottom line is that the hope for a
meaningful deal is vanishingly small if China doesn't sign on.

I've asked Todd to identify the specific areas where he thinks progress can be made through discussions on Thursday.
At a high level, I think leaders' conversations on Thursday will begin to narrow gaps on the big issues -- transparency,
funding, inscribing commitments, etc -- IF (and it's a big if) those gaps are narrow-able. If they're not, then
Thursday/Friday will be days of trying and failing ... but at least trying.
Todd's view is that there is not enough time Friday for top-level meetings to close the deal; that two days are required.
You would be our head of delegation for the first, POTUS for the second.

Will do. Below is the formal statement that was released in the PM's name:
Today, my cabinet authorized a policy of restraint regarding settlements which will include a suspension of new permits
and new construction in Judea and Samaria for a period of ten months.
My cabinet authorized this far reaching step because of our deep desire for peace.
We hope that this decision will help launch meaningful peace negotiations to reach a historic peace agreement that will
finally end the conflict between the Palestinians and Israel.
We are committed to working closely with the United States to advance peace and security in the region.
We have been told by many friends that once Israel takes the first step towards peace, the Palestinians and the Arab
world would respond positively with steps of their own to create a virtuous cycle of goodwill.
Well, the government of Israel is taking a very big and difficult step toward peace today.
I hope that the Palestinians and the Arab world will seize this opportunity to work with us to forge a new beginning and
a new future for our children and for their children.
Since the day our government was sworn in eight months ago, we have been calling for direct negotiations with the
Palestinians.
During that time, we have taken many concrete actions to improve daily life for the Palestinians and to create a climate
in which political negotiations would have the best chance to succeed.
We have dismantled hundreds of roadblocks and checkpoints, extended the hours of operation on the Allenby Bridge
and removed bureaucratic obstacles to Palestinian economic development.
These actions have helped spur a surge, a boom, in the Palestinian economy. At the same time, the security
environment has improved thanks both to the efforts of the IDF and to the efforts of better trained PA security forces.
Now we wish to add to this improved economic and security climate meaningful political negotiations.
I have already said that we will not build new settlements and that we would not expropriate additional land for existing
settlements.
I said we would also restrain settlement activity, and that's exactly what we decided to do today.

Israel has taken a far reaching step for peace. It's time for the Palestinians to do the same.

Will do. Below is the formal statement that was released in the PM's name:
Today, my cabinet authorized a policy of restraint regarding settlements which will include a suspension of new permits
and new construction in Judea and Samaria for a period of ten months.
My cabinet authorized this far reaching step because of our deep desire for peace.
We hope that this decision will help launch meaningful peace negotiations to reach a historic peace agreement that will
finally end the conflict between the Palestinians and Israel.
We are committed to working closely with the United States to advance peace and security in the region.
We have been told by many friends that once Israel takes the first step towards peace, the Palestinians and the Arab
world would respond positively with steps of their own to create a virtuous cycle of goodwill.
Well, the government of Israel is taking a very big and difficult step toward peace today.
I hope that the Palestinians and the Arab world will seize this opportunity to work with us to forge a new beginning and
a new future for our children and for their children.
Since the day our government was sworn in eight months ago, we have been calling for direct negotiations with the
Palestinians.
During that time, we have taken many concrete actions to improve daily life for the Palestinians and to create a climate
in which political negotiations would have the best chance to succeed.

We have dismantled hundreds of roadblocks and checkpoints, extended the hours of operation on the Allenby Bridge
and removed bureaucratic obstacles to Palestinian economic development.
These actions have helped spur a surge, a boom, in the Palestinian economy. At the same time, the security
environment has improved thanks both to the efforts of the IDF and to the efforts of better trained PA security forces.
Now we wish to add to this improved economic and security climate meaningful political negotiations.
I have already said that we will not build new settlements and that we would not expropriate additional land for existing
settlements.
I said we would also restrain settlement activity, and that's exactly what we decided to do today.
I promised to enable normal life to continue for the three hundred thousand Israeli citizens, our brothers and sisters,
who live in Judea and Samaria.
That is why this suspension will not affect construction currently underway.

Subject FW: Irish Times: North's leaders clash on devolution
See the story below. Consensus recommendation is that you call PR and MM tomorrow or Wednesday. Because we
expect them both to go to the press after they speak with you, we believe it would be best for you to keep the calls at a
very high level. Essentially:
O Two months have passed since your trip to Belfast and you're checking in;
• You're concerned about the news reports;
O You understand that there are substantive differences and frayed nerves, but you want to encourage all parties
to take positive actions and avoid unhelpful ones;
• You remain prepared to assist in any way — you are personally invested in seeing them work through to the
completion of this process;
• Declan is hard at work, but his efforts are hampered by the lack of progress and the public conflict
You would be mostly in listening mode and wouldn't engage substantively on the issues that are dividing them — parades
(Sinn Fein doesn't want to concede anything on parades without a date for devolution) and a date (DUP doesn't want to
set a date until they get progress on parades).
If you're amenable, we-can move forward and schedule the calls.
Thanks,
Jake

FYI. Kamala
North's leaders clash on devolution
The North's leaders Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness clashed in public today as the split at the heart of
the power-sharing government deepened.
The clash came as Taoiseach Brian Cowen lead a team of Government ministers in a session of cross-Border
talks with members of the Northern Ireland administration.
As the pair appeared before the cameras at a press conference their private disagreement over the devolution of
policing and justice powers to the Stormont Assembly deepened when Mr McGuinness accused his counterpart
of raising roadblocks to a deal.

As the men stood side-by-side in front of the media, a visibly angry Mr Robinson effectively reprimanded his
opposite number accusing him of bringing private details into the public domain.
The temperature rose as Mr McGuinness continually shook his head in disagreement as Mr Robinson spoke.
The Sinn Fein deputy leader hit out at Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) calls for a scrapping of the Parades
Commission, which rules on Orange Order parades, and said it could not be a pre-condition to a deal on the
transfer of policing and justice powers.
Mr McGuinness: "I move forward against the backdrop of the agreements that I made with Peter Robinson 13
months ago where we agreed an over-30 step approach to the transfer of powers on policing and justice.
"I have to say at no stage in that process was the issue of issues being used as pre-conditions for the transfer of
power for policing and justice mentioned."
In a reference to a DUP letter to the Prime Minister demanding 'confidence building' measures for unionists
before a deal, Mr McGuinness added: "At no stage were people contemplating sending, on solo runs, letters to
Prime Ministers which effectively I had not seen, was not made aware of and was completely surprised by."
Mr Robinson hit back by claiming republicans had already backed reform of parades, but had now opted to
delay the measures as a tactic.
The First Minister, who glanced at his adviser and became visibly angry as Mr McGuinness spoke, added: "I
regret the tone of the latter remarks.
"I don't think that it is helpful for us to be going into the finer details of these matters, but nobody is in any
doubt that the issue of parades was moving forward and was held back."
The exchanges were seen as a public demonstration of the two leaders' long-running private dispute.
Mr McGuinness is already on record as having said that he has not been able to build an adequate relationship
with Mr Robinson, despite having enjoyed a good working relationship with his predecessor as DUP leader, Ian
Paisley.
The North-South Ministerial Council, first formed under the Belfast Agreement of 1998 is marking its tenth
anniversary, but proceedings today were overshadowed by fears for the future of the Stormont Assembly.
Today's meeting in Limavady, Co Deny, brought together ministers from North and South, who announced
progress on a series of cross-Border projects.

China sees no chance of climate deal - source
Thu Dec 17, 2009
Print I Single Page
By Krittivas Mukherjee and Pete Harrison
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - China has told participants in the U.N. climate change talks that it sees no possibility of
achieving an operational accord this week, an official involved in the Copenhagen talks said on Thursday.
Dozens of heads of state are descending on the Danish capital to address the December 7-18 conference, and had hoped
to sign on Friday a new pact to tackle global warming.
The official, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters the Chinese had instead suggested issuing "a short political
declaration of some sort," but it was not clear what that would say.
The official said negotiations were continuing to try to reach a breakthrough that would still allow an operational
agreement to be signed. The official said the sticking point for China appeared to be a process issue.
U.S. President Barack Obama has called for an "operational accord" -- essentially a political agreement with teeth that
can get countries working to cut or curb their greenhouse gas emissions while a more formal and binding treaty is
hammered out in 2010.
Some ministers warned that slow, often stalled talks during the summit meant it was staring at failure.
"We may not get there on the substance, it is quite possible we'll fail on the substance, but at least let's give it a try,"
said Britain's energy and climate minister Ed Miliband.
"At the moment the problem is we're not giving it a try."
Developed and developing nations are at odds over who should cut emissions, how deep the cuts should be, and how
much funding should be provided to poor countries to help them shift to greener growth and adapt to a warmer world.
While the overall picture is bleak, there has been some progress in areas critical to reaching a deal.
Africa dramatically scaled back its expectations for climate aid from rich nations, and Japan pledged about $11 billion
(6.8 billion pound) in public funds to 2012 to help poor countries adapt to a warmer world and cut their emissions.
Talks on a U.N.-backed system to pay poorer nations to curb deforestation have advanced, and the United States
pledged $1 billion in short-term funds to conserve tropical forests.

A major sticking point between the world's top emitters, the United States and China, has been the question of how
they will prove they are sticking to emission-curbing plans.
On Tuesday, China's climate change ambassador warned developed countries against using climate change as an excuse
to set up trade barriers. Yu Qingtai said rich nations should not think that slapping carbon tariffs on imports from
countries with different emissions control regimes would substitute for reaching a global deal to tackle warming.

A/S Valenzuela's Trip to South America: Valenzuela in Argentina Chile's El Mercurio reports that the visit of A/S
Valenzuela resulted last night in another misunderstanding between Washington and Buenos Aires because of
statements by the US official regarding the management of the Argentine economy. Controversy arose over statement
by Valenzuela during a restricted meeting with the local press in which he echoes the concerns of American
businessmen in that country regarding "judicial insecurity" and the management of the economy. Valenzuela, also
indicated that has been noted "change" in the investment climate for US businesses and reminded those present that
"in 1996 there was a great deal of enthusiasm regarding investment" in Argentina. The Argentine Foreign Ministry
responded in a communiqué that the government "has not received complaints from US business with interests and
investments in the country." Interior Minister Florencia Randazzo lamented that "some officials revert to old practices"
when there is the expectation of a new period in US foreign policy." Argentina's Clarin carries the same story titled
"Official Anger with Obama's Envoy Because He Spoke about Judicial Insecurity" with the Interior Minister's riposte
"Argentina is living in a period of complete judicial and institutional guarantees" and the nation "has left behind the
period in which an official of another country can tell ours what guarantees should exist to benefit its own
interests." INFOBAE.com adds that Minister of Justice Julio Alak described Valenzuela's statements as "unprecedented
and unjustified."

WASHINGTON — U.S. Senator George LeMieux (R-FL) today released the following statement regarding his
decision to allow the nomination of Tom Shannon to move forward. Mr. Shannon is nominated to be the next
U.S. ambassador to Brazil.
Senator LeMieux stated:
As a senator from Florida, the gateway to Latin America, it is incumbent upon me to focus on U.S. policy as it
relates to the Western Hemisphere. It is my assessment that U.S. foreign policy in the hemisphere stands at a
critical juncture. Our actions in the region signal to all countries where we stand on our commitment to
respecting democracy, human rights and the rule of law. Our policy in Latin America cannot be transactional.
We must insist on human rights and other democratic institutions including the rule of law. Fortifying
democratic institutions and pursuing respect for human rights is the cornerstone of United States' foreign policy
in Latin America.
It was because of these concerns that I placed a hold on the nomination of Tom Shannon. This allowed more
time for me to evaluate Mr. Shannon's record and to ask specific questions of Mr. Shannon and State
Department officials.
Two countries that represent the direction of the foreign policy commitments of the United States are Honduras
and Cuba — Honduras, having just emerged from a constitutional process that resulted in the removal of its
president and elections, and Cuba, where a dictatorial regime continues to oppress its people and violate their
most basic human rights. In these two areas, the United States must be resolute — demonstrating through action
our insistence on democracy and respect for the rule of law.
During this process I have discussed my concerns for the region with Secretary Clinton. I am grateful for her
appreciation of the unique responsibility I have to the region as a Senator from Florida. I am confident
Secretary Clinton shares my concern about a reverse of the progress of democracy and the rise of authoritarian
strongmen in Latin America. I have received sufficient commitments from Secretary Clinton that the
Administration's policy in Latin America, and specifically in Honduras and Cuba, will take a course that
promotes democratic ideals and goals.
As a result of these discussions with Secretary Clinton and other State Department officials, I am pleased to
report several concrete examples of this commitment.

In Honduras, the U.S. will continue to normalize relations with that country's government and President-elect
Lobo. Counter-narcotics cooperation will resume, and visa procedures will be normalized.
In Cuba, the U.S. will reopen the process for non-profit organizations to apply for pro-democracy grants, the
practice of including members of the Cuban pro-democracy movement in events at the U.S. Interests Section
will be restored, Title W of the Helms Burton Act will be enforced, and the awarding of Cuba Democracy
Assistance grants will be done in a fair and transparent manner.
Ensuring our neighbors in the hemisphere recognize our commitment to democracy, human rights and the rule
of law is fundamental. Leaders in nations that seek to destabilize the region are paying close attention to U.S.
actions and the way in which we carry out our policies in Latin America. I look forward to a continuing
dialogue on hOw we can strengthen U.S. relations with the nations of the Western Hemisphere.

Jake
In the past 48 hours, the political situation in Pakistan has entered a new phase. The Supreme Court ruled the NRO
illegal and paved the way for prosecution of several government officials, most notably Interior Minister Rehman Malik.
Malik has been summoned before the Court and the Defense Minister (along with 247 other officials) was barred from
traveling to China on an official visit. Vali Nasr has been following the fast-moving and still unclear developments
closely.
In addition, the Supreme Court has opened the door to new petitions to be filed, questioning
Zardari's eligibility to have run for president in the first place. The Court could use those petitions to force Zardari from
office in the near future. It is clear that Zardari's fate will be decided by the military, which has been gaining prominence
and will be in an even stronger position after this shake-up.
In the past two days Gilani has come to Zardari's defense, suggesting the two have reached an agreement over
transfer of power from president to prime minister.

We spent two hours with the Burmese this afternoon. Kurt laid out our position, and stressed that the Burmese had an
opportunity if they were willing to move, but that the window wouldn't stay open forever.
It was a substantive meeting. I don't think we could have been clearer about our position. As expected, burmese
weren't in a position to make any commitments, but said they'd take it back to the senior leadership. They focused on
the ethnic insurgencies as a source of instability.
Tone was good, and I think Kurt did a very good job laying out our points -- clear, firm, diplomatic.

September 11, 2009 Contact: Senator Levin's Office
Phone: 202.224.6221
Senate Floor Speech - Surge the Afghan Army
Remarks as prepared for delivery
Today we mark a solemn anniversary. Eight years ago this morning, our nation was attacked by terrorist extremists
motivated by hatred and bent on destruction. It is always appropriate to remember the shock of that day, the innocent
lives lost, and the efforts our nation has made since that day to ensure that Afghanistan, the nation that hosted those
terrorists, cannot again become a safe haven for terrorists seeking to attack us. But today is an especially appropriate
occasion to take stock of those efforts, and consider how best to continue them.
I recently returned from a trip to Afghanistan, where I was joined by my colleagues Senators Jack Reed and Ted
Kaufman. The situation in Afghanistan is serious. Security has deteriorated. But if we take the right steps, we can ensure
that Afghanistan does not revert to a Taliban-friendly government that could once again provide a safe haven for al
Qaeda to terrorize us and the world.
The Obama administration's new strategy, focusing on securing the Afghan population's safety and partnering with the
Afghan security forces in that effort, is an important start at reversing the situation in Afghanistan. The change in
strategy has led our forces, in the words of General McChrystal's Counterinsurgency Guidance, to "live, eat and train
together [with the Afghan security forces], plan and operate together, depend on one another, and hold each other
accountable....and treat them as equal partners in success." The Guidance goes on to say that the success of the Afghan
security forces "is our goal."
To achieve that goal we should increase and accelerate our efforts to support the Afghan security forces in their efforts
to become self-sufficient in delivering security to their nation — before we consider whether to increase U.S. combat
forces above the levels already planned for the next few months. These steps include increasing the size of the Afghan
Army and police much faster than presently planned; providing more trainers for the Afghan Army and police than
presently planned; providing them more equipment than presently planned; and working to separate local Taliban
fighters from their leaders and attract them to the side of the government as we did in Iraq.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766340 Date: 07/31/2015
While the security situation in Afghanistan has worsened, we still have important advantages there. The Afghan people
hate the Taliban. Public opinion polls show support for the Taliban at about 5%. In addition, the Afghan army is highly
motivated and its troops are proven fighters.
Despite those advantages, we face significant challenges. General McChrystal believes, and I agree, that we need to
regain the initiative and create a momentum towards success. General McChrystal worries, and rightly so, about the
perception that we have lost that initiative, and the impact of that perception on the Afghan people, their government,
al Qaeda and the Taliban. By contrast, if we can dispel that perception, we have a chance to convince local and lower-
level Taliban fighters to lay down their arms and rejoin Afghan society.
I believe the most effective way to retake the initiative in Afghanistan is with a series of steps to ensure that
Afghanistan's army and police have the manpower, equipment and support to secure their own nation.
First, we should increase troop levels for the Afghan army and police faster than currently planned. There are
approximately 90,000 troops in the Afghan army now, and that number is scheduled to go up to 134,000 by October of
2010. The Afghan police are scheduled to reach a level of 82,000 by the same time. For a long time, many of us have
urged the establishment of a goal of 240,000 Afghan troops and 160,000 Afghan police by 2013. The Afghan Minister of
Defense has strongly supported those numbers. It now appears that our government and the Afghan government are
prepared to accept those goals. But the need for additional Afghan forces is urgent. I believe it both possible and
essential to advance those goals by a year, to 2012.
Our own military in Afghanistan has repeatedly pointed to a need for more Afghan forces. In one sector of Helmand
province we visited last week, our Marines outnumbered Afghan soldiers by 5 to one. A Marine Company commander in
Helmand province told the New York Times in July that a lack of Afghan troops "is absolutely our Achilles heel."
What do we need to do to increase the size of the Afghan army and police? According to Afghan Defense Minister
Wardak, there is no lack of Afghan manpower; we've been assured it is available.
But we will need significantly more trainers. We asked General Formica, who is in charge of the American effort to train
Afghan security forces, whether such an increase is possible. He indicated he would make an assessment of what would
be necessary in order to meet the earlier timetable. In the meantime, we should also press our NATO allies with much
greater forcefulness to provide more trainers. If our NATO allies are not going to come through with the combat forces
they have pledged, at least they could provide additional trainers.
Larger Afghan security forces will also require more mid-level Afghan officers. In addition to supporting efforts to
graduate more Afghan officers from army academies, we should consider the recommendation of Defense Minister
Wardak that previous mid-level officers who fought the war against the Soviets return to service on an interim basis.
Minister Wardak emphasized that those men are well qualified and well motivated, and while they may not be trained in
the most current tactics, they nonetheless could temporarily meet the need of the enlarged army while the new group
of officers is trained. A larger Afghan force will need supporting infrastructure, such a barracks. While the available
infrastructure may not be the most modern, it is adequate and exists in sufficient amounts.
Larger Afghan security forces will require additional equipment. There must be a major effort to transfer a significant
amount of the equipment that is coming out of Iraq to the Afghan army and police. Such a significant commitment to
equip the Afghan security forces would also help demonstrate U.S. determination to take the initiative and create
momentum in the right direction. There is an enormous amount of equipment coming out of Iraq; our military is calling
it one of the greatest transfers of military goods in the world's history. A significant part of it could be transferred to the
Afghan forces, increasing their capability without weakening our own readiness. And yet there does not seem to be that
kind of a crash effort in place to do that. We need to obtain on an urgent basis a list of the basic equipment needs of the
Afghan forces and a list of how those needs could be met in a major program to transfer equipment leaving Iraq.
Rapidly expanding Afghanistan's military and police forces would address one of the major problems and risks we now
face there. General McChrystal told us he worries that waiting until 2013 for a larger Afghan force creates a gap in
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766340 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766340 Date: 07/31/2015
capabilities that brings significant risk of failure. But by accelerating the training and equipping of Afghan forces by a
year, we address his concern. Depending on additional capability from Afghan, rather than U.S., forces, also addresses a
major problem of public perception in Afghanistan. The larger our own military footprint there, the more our enemies
can seek to drive a wedge between us and the Afghan population, spreading the falsehood that we seek to dominate a
Muslim nation.
Finally, we should make a concerted effort to separate the local Taliban from their leaders. In Iraq, large numbers of
young Iraqis who had been attacking us switched over to our side and became the "Sons of Iraq." They were drawn in
part by the promise of jobs and amnesty for past attacks, and in part by the recognition that the status quo was creating
horrific violence in their own communities. In their own interests and the interests of their nation, they switched sides
and became a positive force.
That same prospect exists in Afghanistan. Afghan leaders and our military say that local Taliban fighters are motivated
largely by the need for a job or loyalty to the local leader who pays them and not by ideology or religious zeal. They
believe an effort to attract these fighters to the government's side could succeed, if they are offered security for
themselves and their families, and if there is no penalty for previous activity against us.
General McChrystal himself has emphasized the potential of such re-integration to accomplish the same result as was
achieved in Iraq. Here is what General McChrystal said on July 28th:
"Most of the fighters we see in Afghanistan are Afghans, some with foreign cadre with them. But most we don't see are
deeply ideological or even politically motivated; most are operating for pay; some are under a commander's charismatic
leadership; some are frustrated with local leaders. So I believe there is significant potential to go after what I would call
mid- and low-level Taliban fighters and leaders and offer them re-integration into Afghanistan under the constitution."
But this "game changing" possibility was apparently not factored into General McChrystal's assessment. There is no plan
yet to put in place a Sons of Iraq approach in Afghanistan. It is urgent that we lay out the steps that need to be taken to
involve local and national Afghan leaders in that effort. They alone can accomplish this crucial job, but first we and our
Afghan allies must draft such a plan on an urgent basis. And the potential positive impact of such a plan should be taken
into account as we consider the need for any additional U.S. military resources.
Afghanistan's people are grateful for our aid, but also eager to assume responsibility for their future. In a tiny village in
Helmand Province, we were invited to meet with the village elders at their council meeting, their shura. One hundred or
so men sat on the floor and chatted with us about their future and their country's future. When asked how long the
United States should stay, one elder said: "Until the moment that you make our security forces self-sufficient. Then you
will be welcome to visit us, not as soldiers but as guests."
Helping Afghanistan achieve self-sufficiency in their security is everybody's goal. On that there is little difference of
opinion, in Afghanistan's village councils or in the corridors of this Capitol.
Can we help Afghanistan reach self-sufficiency in security fast enough? Can we get there in a way that regains the
initiative and creates the momentum we need? Can we encourage those lower level Taliban to abandon an insurgency
headed by terrorists whose fanaticism they don't share?
I believe we can, by supporting a far more rapid growth in the Afghan Army and police; by providing more trainers more
quickly; by a rapid infusion to Afghan units of equipment no longer needed in Iraq; and by rapidly adopting a plan for the
re-integration of lower level Taliban fighters into Afghan society. In other words, we need a surge of Afghan security
forces.
Our support of their surge will show our commitment to the success of a mission that is clearly in our national security
interest, without creating a bigger U.S. military footprint that provides propaganda fodder for the Taliban.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766340 Date: 07/31/2015
I believe that taking those steps on an urgent basis, while completing the previously planned and announced increase in
U.S. combat forces, provides the best chance of success for our mission: preventing Afghanistan from again being run by
a Taliban government which harbors and supports Al-Qaeda, whose goal is to inflict additional catastrophic attacks on
the United States and the world. And we should implement these steps before considering an increase in U.S. ground
combat forces beyond what is already planned by the end of this year.

Gordon Brown called Lou Susman a short while ago. Brown believes you should make a call to McGuinness this morning
around 830 am (Declan and I agree that if you call McG you also must call Robinson). Brown proposes to speak with you
at 820 or so to bring you up to speed before those calls.
The current situation is that Brown and Cowen are in Belfast, and met with Robinson, McGuinness, and other parties
until 330 in the morning Belfast time. They have now resumed today. The sticking point is parades. Robinson wants the
current parades commission abolished because it gives Republicans too much say. McGuinness refuses to allow the
parades issue to be tied to the devolution issue.
The key message to McGuinness is to keep working this thing through -- not to take any drastic action that would bring
down the assembly or collapse the process.
Declan agrees that this is the moment to make calls.
If you agree we can have the ops center set up the Brown call as well as the other two.
We'll get you some more background before the calls, but talking points will be fluid and shaped in large measure by
Brown's report.

Calls to Brown and Northern Ireland Political Leaders
PM Brown has asked to brief you on ongoing negotiations convened by the UK and Irish
governments yesterday with FM Peter Robinson and dFM Martin McGuinness and their
respective teams, which lasted until 3:30 a.m. in the morning and resumed at 9:00 a.m. today.
Sinn Fein and the DUP are apparently not yet meeting face to face at Hillsborough but using the
two governments as go betweens. On-site observers have characterized the current atmosphere
between the two parties as "poisonous."
B6
were invited to Hillsborough yesterday night. However, these
parties tell us that this was only an informational exercise and they have yet to be included in
any substantive meetings.
Outstanding Issues: The obstacle to progress seems to be centered on the parades issue and
setting of specific dates for devolution. Robinson and the DUP are insisting on the abolishing
of the Parades Commission, an independent panel despised by the Orange Order as restricting
their desire to parade through nationalist areas, and the adoption of a new process relying on
local councils to refer potentially contentious parades to an OFM/dFM selected panel. Sinn
Fein and SDLP are both concerned that this will politicize decision-making on parades and
PSNI involvement.
In late December, the UK government renewed the Parades Commission's mandate until
December 2010, so it is expected that any new process would not be implemented until after the
summer 2010 parading season.

Outcomes: If McGuinness resigns (likely along with the other SF ministers) thereby collapsing
the current Executive, the Northern Ireland Act provides for seven calendar days for a new
Executive to be formed. Failing that, the Assembly cease to operation and Secretary of State
Woodward is supposed to schedule new elections though he is not required to do so within a
certain timeframe. (Technically, it would take at least five weeks to organize new Assembly
elections.) B1

Statement by the Secretary
On the Restoration of Democratic and Constitutional Order In Honduras November 27, 2009
The United States remains committed to help restore the democratic and constitutional order in Honduras in the wake
of the June 28 coup d'etat that removed President Zelaya and led to the suspension of Honduras from the Organization
of American States. As part of that effort, it is essential for both parties in Honduras to implement the measures they
agreed to in the Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord, including the formation of a government of unity and national
reconciliation and the December 2 congressional vote on President Zelaya"s restitution. These are vital elements of the
Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord, and the Honduran people and the international community expect an expeditious
determination. We look forward to the Congressional deliberations getting underway as announced.
The November 29 national elections are another critical step in the restoration of the democratic and constitutional
order in Honduras. The electoral process -- launched well before June 28 and involving legitimate candidates
representing parties with longstanding democratic traditions from a broad ideological spectrum -- is conducted under
the stewardship of the non-partisan Supreme Electoral Tribunal, which was also selected before the coup. The electoral
renewal of presidential, congressional and mayoral mandates, enshrined in the Honduran constitution, is an inalienable
expression of the sovereign will of the citizens of Honduras. We wish the Honduran people well as they choose their
new leaders on Sunday, and we urge all sides to exercise their rights peacefully.
The holding of a free, fair and transparent election is necessary but not sufficient for Honduras to reestablish the
democratic and constitutional order. In order to help achieve that objective, we will continue, along with others in the
region, to support the step-by-step implementation of the Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord as a democratic way forward for
the Honduran people. The president-elect who emerges from an election deemed free and fair will have a unique
opportunity to promote that vital mission.

Photo is gorgeous (and there are 20 more online, some are really great)
The article is good, just way too short, so it became very matter of fact, didn't include a lot of the great stuff he saw that
day. They cut what he turned in in half.
But for this readership, that length is probably perfect. It supposedly gets seen by 70 million people. 69 million
probably never open it up and just see it in their Sunday paper, so the cover is the ballgame. Story is basically an excuse
for the cover. And the cover is a homerun.
In the end, I firmly believe it will be the totality all these in-depth projects like Vogue, National Geographic, Nightline,
Time - which I know are annoying - that are going to create a collage documenting your success, especially in terms of
style and work ethic, which I believe is what people are most interested when it comes to their perception and approval

Dear Todd, thank you for this - and for our cooperation throughout. No, it has not been easy and I sense also a bit of the
struggle you have been thorugh in your end. And it is not over yet. You will need to get your legislation done - and we
shall have to transform a fragile Copenhagen Accord into a strong working instrument for global action on climate
change. All to be accomplished before June.
I look forward to be part of this drive and to be cooperating with you and your team in this regard. May be useful to
touch base early in January to assess way ahead.
Meanwhile, I want to assure you how much also I have come to appreciate the way you have been going about all of
this. In a world and through some intense months, weeks and days where not everybody has always played cards
openly, I have felt you to be one relayable force with an integrety and credibility that I never had reason to question.

Next time, I shall bring a book - as a token of friedship! 1.4(B)

Here's the update, pieced together from various sources:
Starting at around 3 pm Friday, Adams and McGuinness returned to Hillsborogh to meet with Robinson and Arlene
Foster. The four talked privately for several hours and then asked for the draft papers to review. The discussion
continued until around 1 am when the parties left Hillsborough. (Foster's presence is apparently very helpful. Her
relationship with the SF leaders is much more positive and direct, treating them as equal colleagues.)
Woodward and Irish FM Martin will meet with Adams and Robinson separately this afternoon to assess where the talks
are. The talks last night/early morning ended more positively and if that is still the case there may be a decision to push
on today to see if agreement can be reached. It is equally possible that the two ministers and DUP/SF will decide to
wind up today and resume on Monday.
Brown and Cowen have spoken this morning and will speak again late this afternoon.
The issue is still parades. Robinson needs some certainity of change on parades. It is important for him politically within
the DUP, but also externally since this has become a symbol of whether he has achieved something or compromised too
much. Adams and SF have moved very far from their original positions on parades, adding that Robinson has also
moved.
The DUP linkage of the timeframes for devolution and parades is not Robinson's goal but DUP deputy party leader Nigal
Dodds. Logistically, such a linkage would be impossible without delaying devolution given that the parades framework
requires consultation, legislation, and implementation.
The role of Justice Minister and his/her relationship to the Executive has been agreed. Other issues, such as Irish
language act, N-S bodies, etc, while symbolic and emotive for SF and the nationalists community can be dealt with.

On Mexico, consensus is that a call is worthwhile, but we will get you an updated call sheet that accounts for intervening

Subject: Call from Sam Lewis
I would like to keep this close hold please:
Former Panamanian VP/FM Sam Lewis just called to say he and former President Torrijos have been talking informally to
Presidents Colom, Funes and Ortega. He said all three are concerned about finding a way forward in Honduras and that
they realize elections must be part of the picture. They think the president-elect of Honduras will have a chance to
pursue national reconciliation, including a unity government. They also said the region needs better mechanisms to
head off coups and wondered about amending the IADC.
I told Sam about our step by step package approach and the vital role of elections in that package. Keep an eye out for
our statement today, I added. We have always believed in changing the Honduran dynamic one move at a time -- he
agreed. I noted that many Hondurans have talked of an eventual national dialogue to address social inclusion. Sam said
Pathways could be a great vehicle for Honduras in that regard, and I said we were already looking at the Honduran
chairmanship of Pathways Working Group One as an opportune way forward.
In the short run, I said, it would be important for Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua to avoid negative statements
about the elections and to say positive things after Monday if the vote goes smoothly.
Sam agreed to pass that message and said he would stay in touch.

Looks like tomorrow will be a down day and then they'll reconvene Monday to try to bang out the last details and

Interesting observations from DecIan:
Foster was a critical component in the talks apparently. However there is already speculation that PR may use this
moment to try to come back early and resume position of FM given that the other investigations have been delayed
pending the outcome of the police investigation. He went to London with his family yesterday to visit his wife, who is in
a clinic there apparently.
Empey still not on board apparently so the "community confidence" round may be used to put pressure on him to do so.
Our intervention on Thursday night/Friday morning was seen as a very important moment/catalyst. That, coupled with
the jobs losses that day and the fact that the radio and tv phone-in lines and newspapers were full of commentary
supporting what we said, seems to have made people realize, that they couldn't lose the moment.

Madame Secretary:
Per our earlier conversation and within the boundaries of unclassified email, there are three objectives we can achieve
regarding the country we
discussed:
1)Enable broad communication between resistance organizers and participants without significantly increasing risk for
individuals;
2) Circumventing government-imposed firewalls that expediently enable individuals to transmit text, image and video
documentation of what is happening on the ground; and
3) Identify and make viral symbolic content that will move global opinion.
All of my and Jared's ideas which you saw reflected in the memo from last week are executable from anywhere between
24 hours to a couple months.
There are not any technological barriers to execution, but as I discussed with Jake, some take us well past the
boundaries of what has been allowable to date in our current policy framework.
That said, we are ready and willing to take action as soon we have a "go" order. I am happy to review specific content
from the memo with you or others offline.
Separately, I wanted to share some key activities following up on your Internet Freedom speech, which has reverberated
globally. Here is what we are doing to maintain forward momentum:
1)With your blessing, we will build a new architecture of States who share our principles of Internet freedom and are
committed to not just espousing those principles, but collaborating in measurably reducing the number of States that
countervail the freedoms you outlined in your speech.
2) Jared and I met with Stanford President John Hennessy last week and we will work through Stanford to indirectly
launch an innovation competition for the best apps and programs that provide tools for circumvention of politically
motivated censorship.
'3) Maria Otero and Bob Hormats will co-chair a session in which we are hauling in the major, relevant technology
companies. There may be some squealing, but we want to ensure that the private sector understands our values and
make more carefully considered decisions about the deals they cut with foreign governments. In these meetings, we will

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766858 Date: 08/31/2015
also look for the private sector to contribute resources (financial, engineering, hardware, etc.) in support of your
Internet Freedom objectives. Finally, we intend to build an industry-led coalition with a set of standards that have real
teeth and accountability.
4) We will be deploying our Civil Society 2.0 team to work with local stakeholders in key environments on capacity
building that will enhance their ability to address the key issues you articulated in your Internet freedom speech.
There are other activities which I can detail separately and will review with Cheryl and Jake.
My best,
Alec

Argentina's La Nacion comments that the greatest lesson of events in Honduras "has been the worldwide reaction in the
name of respect for constitutional order." The paper says the military acted badly but was reacting to Zelaya's own
unconstitutional behavior, and notes that "the US was among the first to understand the complexity of the Honduran case
and the difficulties in treating it as a derivation of a classic military coup. It was also the US that was the first to announce
that it was ready to work with the Lobo government to strengthen Honduran democracy..."

Blair's guy said you ok'ed releasing today. If so, we'll pull the trigger. It is pasted below:
Statement by the Secretary
This Administration has, from the beginning, worked to bring about comprehensive peace in the Middle East, including a
two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. On that issue our approach has been three-fold: (1) to help build the
economy and capacity to govern of a Palestinian state; (2) to renew political negotiations to enable the earliest possible
establishment of that state; and (3) to achieve these in a manner that ensures the security of Israel and of the
Palestinians.
Consistent with Prime Minister Fayyad's plan for a future Palestinian state, Tony Blair, as the Quartet representative, will
intensify his partnership with Senator Mitchell in support of the political negotiations. In his role as Quartet
Representative Tony Blair will continue, with full support by and coordination with Senator Mitchell, to mobilize the
efforts of the international community: (1) to build support for the institutional capacity and governance of a future
Palestinian State, including on the rule of law; (2) to improve freedom of movement and access for Palestinians; (3) to
encourage further private sector investment; and (4) to bring change in the living conditions of the people in Gaza.

Subject Pinera-Insulza
See the report below: Pinera has announced his support.
I had a long conversation with Craig a little while ago. He spoke with a number of people in Chile, including his close
friend,
According to Craig, Pinera had made the calculation that it would be politically untenable to dump Insulza. Apparently
there is a coalition leadership in the lower house, and Insulza's party, Concertacion, controls the upper house. So he had
no choice.
That said, Craig believes that his clear message had an impact on what Pinera told Insulza. He apparently gave his
support with two conditions: (1) don't interfere in Chilean politics, and (2) take the democratization agenda seriously
and don't carry the ALBA countries' water.
Craig also said that Arturo had been effective in making clear that the jury was out on Insulza in Washington -- that had
an impact on the Pinera government and reinforced their second message to him.
Bottom line: Craig said we couldn't have talked Pinera off of this, but we helped drive a stronger set of conditions on
Pinera's support.

Shaun just called, 7:50 pm EST, to relate the latest sequence and to tell you that after near breakdown of negotiations
on Monday they are back on track (maybe). Robinson went into his assembly on Monday thinking he could pull off the
deal, but was shocked to discover the degree of opposition, centering partly on Reg Empey (UUP). (Cameron has tried to

forge an alliance of UUP, elements of DUP and the Tories, on the agenda at the secret country house meeting last week.)
But tonight, Wednesday, Shaun has got Robinson and McGuiness to agree to all points, pushing past the previous
sticking point on the Minister of Justice and relation to the Executive. The matter now rests with Robinson and his ability
to sell it tomorrow. He has told Shaun and Gordon he believes he can do it. He needs 75 percent of his party. So, the
perils of peace continue.

Subject: U.N. Rejects 'Militarization' of Afghan Aid (NYT, Nordland)
By ROD NORDLAND
Published: February 18, 2010 KABUL, Afghanistan -Senior United Nations officials
in Afghanistan on Wednesday criticized NATO forces for what one referred to as
"the militarization of humanitarian aid," and said United Nations agencies would
not participate in the military's reconstruction strategy in Marja as part of its
current offensive there. "We are not part of that process, we do not want to be
part of it," said Robert Watkins, the deputy special representative of the
secretary general, at a news conference attended by other officials to announce
the United Nations' Humanitarian Action Plan for 2010. "We will not be part of
that military strategy." The American commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley A.
McChrystal, has made the rapid delivery of governmental services, including
education, health care and job programs, a central part of his strategy in Marja,
referring to plans to rapidly deploy what he has referred to as "a government in
a box" once Marja is pacified. Mr. Watkins did not specifically criticize the
Marja offensive, saying, "It is not the military that will be delivering the
services, they will be clearing the area so the government can deliver those
services." However, the United Nations would not be participating, he said. Wael
Haj-Ibrahim, head of the United Nations' Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs here, said the military should not be involved in providing
health care or schools. "If that aid is being delivered as part of a military
strategy, the counterstrategy is to destroy that aid," Mr. Haj-Ibrahim said.
"Allowing the military to do it is not the best use of resources." Instead, he
said, the military should confine itself to clearing an area of security threats
and providing security for humanitarian organizations to deliver services. "The
distribution of aid by the military gives a very difficult impression to the
communities and puts the lives of humanitarian workers at risk," Mr. Watkins
said. Last month, eight leading humanitarian organizations working in
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767257 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767257 Date: 08/31/2015
Afghanistan, including Oxfam and ActionAid, issued a joint report that was highly
critical of the International Security Assistance Force, as the American-led NATO
force is known, because of "the international militaries' use of aid as a
'nonlethal' weapon of war." They maintained that this violated an agreement
between international forces and the United Nations that the military's primary
role should be to provide security and, only when there is no other alternative,
to provide limited developmental and humanitarian assistance. The agencies
maintain they are able to work in conflict areas of Afghanistan when local
residents see them as independent and not connected with the military, and this
approach puts that at risk. "Military-led humanitarian and development activities
are driven by donors' political interests and short-term security objectives and
are often ineffective, wasteful and potentially harmful to Afghans," a statement
by Oxfam said. The United Nations officials expressed the same concern, though
more diplomatically, and one official, who did not want to be quoted by name
because of the political sensitivity of the issue, said the United Nations had
repeatedly raised those concerns with the international forces without success.
The American military refers to its strategy, first enunciated in Iraq in 2006,
as "clear, hold and build." Previously there were insufficient foreign and Afghan
troops in Afghanistan to pursue that strategy systematically because they were
unable to hold large areas for long periods of time. The offensive in Marja is
intended as a showcase where the strategy can work, and the coalition says it has
adequate forces now to do that. "Clear, hold and build, it's short-sighted for
two reasons," the United Nations official said. "Territory changes hands in a
conflict, and if the services are associated with a particular group, it will be
destroyed." That has happened often with projects like schools and clinics around
the country. The officials were particularly critical of NATO's planned "civilian
surge," bringing in more government-financed aid workers involved in projects
like the country's provincial reconstruction teams, which are located in each
province and designed to provide fast-track development and aid services in their
areas. These reconstruction teams are NATO groups run by various allied
countries, including Canada in Kandahar, and Britain in Lashkar Gah, and they
primarily disburse development and aid money locally in each province.Many of the
reconstruction teams, the official said, see their role as providing services in
exchange for intelligence-gathering and political activity directed against the
insurgents. He declined to identify any that operate under that premise, although
he added that not all did so. In many parts of the country, only nongovernmental
organizations are able to operate safely because of the security situation, and
they fill the gap in governmental services. Because the reconstruction teams are
run by foreigners and are associated with their countries' militaries, they need
to go out with heavy security, and aid groups worry that locals begin to
associate all aid workers with the military. Oxfam said the military "was going
way beyond its remit" in Afghanistan, citing an American Army counterinsurgency
manual that defines humanitarian aid as a "nonlethal weapon."A statement issued
Wednesday by the international forces emphasized the military's new, population-
centered approach to fighting the insurgents. "The conduct of Operation Moshtarak
is visibly demonstrating that the force has changed the way it operates and that
it is working with and for the people of Afghanistan," the statement said,
referring to the Marja offensive. It also suggested the military phase of the
operation could be protracted. "The insurgents are tactically adept, have
resilience and are cunning, so continued tactical patience on the part of the
combined force is important. Mining is significant in areas, and the combined

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767257 Date: 08/31/2015
force must be very deliberate in its movement in order to minimize local Afghan
and combined force casualties." The United Nations' Humanitarian Action Plan has
a proposed budget of $870.5 million, a substantial increase over previous years,
because the increased level of NATO military activity has led to increased needs
for services in many parts of the country, according the United Nations.

DUP has gone behind closed doors at Stormont and the smart money is on them emerging at some point supporting the
deal.
There was movement today on the ancillary issue of government support for the Presbyterian Mutual Society, a savings
and loan that lost a lot of money and whose investors didn't get the same financial crisis protections as those in other
institutions. DUP members are pointing to that as enough of a carrot to change their posture on the policing and justice
deal.
Brown and Cowen are poised to go to NI tomorrow. Will keep you posted.

Robinson and McG have confirmed to speak with you.
In his remarks, Brown indicated that you would host an investment conference this spring. Declan believes this is much
too soon. We might try to steer it to you meeting with Robinson and McG this spring — ie in a few weeks time -- with an
eye toward an investment conference once it is well prepared.
I think we are okay waiting an hour to do the statement, but we'll work to get excerpts out. Kamala announced that you

Northern Ireland agrees power-sharing deal
Gordon Brown hails historic deal which will see justice and policing powers be devolved to Stormont from 12 April

Justice and policing powers will be devolved to Northern Ireland <http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/northernireland> 's
power-sharing government from 12 April in a historic deal agreed by the main parties that "opens a new chapter" after
decades of violence, Gordon Brown said today.
Standing alongside his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, at a press conference at Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast, the
prime minister said the "inspirational" agreement between Sinn Fein <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/sinn-fein>
and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/dup> was a foundation for lasting peace.
The deal — finally agreed to by the DUP <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/feb/05/northern-ireland-dup-ulster-
deal> last night and described as a final piece in the jigsaw after a long search for peace — comes after two weeks of
round-the-clock negotiations and brings an end to fears that the power-sharing government might collapse.
It will see policing and justice powers devolved from Westminster to the assembly within weeks and includes new plans
on overseeing parades.
Brown, who travelled to Belfast this morning, said the agreement had been possible because of "a new spirit of mutual
co-operation and respect".
The deal meets a key Sinn Fein demand and prevents the republican party from walking out of the power-sharing
executive. In return, the DUP has secured reforms to the way loyalist marches are handled in Northern Ireland, including
the abolition of the Parades Commission, a body most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists.
A cross-community vote will now be held in the Stormont assembly on 9 March before the policing and justice powers
are devolved from London on 12 April.
Brown told reporters: "The achievements have been as great as they are inspirational. This moment and this agreement
belongs to the people of Northern Ireland, all of the people, and now more than ever before so does their future ... This
is the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years of
talks, weeks of stalemate."
Cowen praised both unionists and nationalists for making "fair and balanced compromises" to bridge the divisions and
said the quality of the negotiations meant that the "devolved institutions can and will work".
The Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, said the deal would further isolate republican dissidents who have
launched three separate gun and bomb attacks against police stations in the province over the last 10 days. The deal
would "absolutely" make Northern Ireland a safer place, he said.
The DUP leader, Peter Robinson, said the agreement "will be more enduring because of the time spent" in forming it.
Referring back to the Belfast Agreement of 1998 <http://www.nio.gov.uk/the-agreement> when negotiations bore fruit
at the 11th hour, the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, described the current deal and the rescue of power-sharing as
"yet another very good Friday".
Jeffrey Donaldson told the Guardian the DUP's 36-strong assembly team was now unanimously in favour of the deal.
But the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) has yet to officially back the package which will allow the assembly to set up
legislation to change the way parades are judged.

A UUP spokeswoman said members wanted to see the proposed agreement before giving their response to the two
governments. "We have not had sight of this agreement and until we do we will not be signing up to it," she said.
The talks, which centred on Hillsborough Castle, outside Belfast, are the longest set of continuous negotiations held in
the near 20-year peace process. Sinn Fein had accused the DUP of stalling on the transfer of policing powers for the last
three years and it was feared that failure to find agreement could see the collapse of the power-sharing government led
by the two parties.
The agreement finally came near midnight at Stormont's parliament building. Earlier in the evening Sinn Fein had said
the basis of a deal was on the table and it was giving the DUP leadership the time to persuade its party to accept it.
Robinson emerged from a meeting of party colleagues to confirm that he had secured unanimous support for the
proposals. Earlier in the week up to 14 DUP assembly members had opposed a proposed deal because it did not give
unionists enough concessions.
Robinson said he would now look to gain the support of the community and the smaller assembly parties for the deal.
"We have a basis upon which we can go forward and recommend it [the deal] to our party, to the other parties in
Northern Ireland and to the community.
"An essential element of the Democratic Unionist Party's manifesto is the requirement for community confidence; we
believe this can be the basis for gaining that confidence."
However the leader of the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), Jim Allister, questioned why the 14 DUP rebels had
changed their minds.
"The deal hasn't changed, only the snowmen of the DUP, who melted once the heat came on," Allister said.
The DUP now faces a struggle to ward off the TUV threat in the forthcoming general election. Allister will portray the
deal as a sell-out of unionist principles and a sop to republicanism.

Justice and policing powers will be devolved to Northern Ireland <http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/northernireland> 's
power-sharing government from 12 April in a historic deal agreed by the main parties that "opens a new chapter" after
decades of violence, Gordon Brown said today.
Standing alongside his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, at a press conference at Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast, the
prime minister said the "inspirational" agreement between Sinn Fein <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/sinn-fein>
and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/dup> was a foundation for lasting peace.
The deal — finally agreed to by the DUP <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/feb/05/northern-ireland-dup-ulster-
deal> last night and described as a final piece in the jigsaw after a long search for peace — comes after two weeks of
round-the-clock negotiations and brings an end to fears that the power-sharing government might collapse.
It will see policing and justice powers devolved from Westminster to the assembly within weeks and includes new plans
on overseeing parades.
Brown, who travelled to Belfast this morning, said the agreement had been possible because of "a new spirit of mutual
co-operation and respect".
The deal meets a key Sinn Fein demand and prevents the republican party from walking out of the power-sharing
executive. In return, the DUP has secured reforms to the way loyalist marches are handled in Northern Ireland, including
the abolition of the Parades Commission, a body most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists.
A cross-community vote will now be held in the Stormont assembly on 9 March before the policing and justice powers
are devolved from London on 12 April.
Brown told reporters: "The achievements have been as great as they are inspirational. This moment and this agreement
belongs to the people of Northern Ireland, all of the people, and now more than ever before so does their future ... This
is the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years of
talks, weeks of stalemate."
Cowen praised both unionists and nationalists for making "fair and balanced compromises" to bridge the divisions and
said the quality of the negotiations meant that the "devolved institutions can and will work".
The Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, said the deal would further isolate republican dissidents who have
launched three separate gun and bomb attacks against police stations in the province over the last 10 days. The deal
would "absolutely" make Northern Ireland a safer place, he said.
The DUP leader, Peter Robinson, said the agreement "will be more enduring because of the time spent" in forming it.
Referring back to the Belfast Agreement of 1998 <http://www.nio.gov.uk/the-agreement> when negotiations bore fruit
at the 11th hour, the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, described the current deal and the rescue of power-sharing as
"yet another very good Friday".
Jeffrey Donaldson told the Guardian the DUP's 36-strong assembly team was now unanimously in favour of the deal.
But the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) has yet to officially back the package which will allow the assembly to set up
legislation to change the way parades are judged.
A UUP spokeswoman said members wanted to see the proposed agreement before giving their response to the two
governments. "We have not had sight of this agreement and until we do we will not be signing up to it," she said.
The talks, which centred on Hillsborough Castle, outside Belfast, are the longest set of continuous negotiations held in
the near 20-year peace process. Sinn Fein had accused the DUP of stalling on the transfer of policing powers for the last
three years and it was feared that failure to find agreement could see the collapse of the power-sharing government led
by the two parties.
The agreement finally came near midnight at Stormont's parliament building. Earlier in the evening Sinn Fein had said
the basis of a deal was on the table and it was giving the DUP leadership the time to persuade its party to accept it.

Robinson emerged from a meeting of party colleagues to confirm that he had secured unanimous support for the
proposals. Earlier in the week up to 14 DUP assembly members had opposed a proposed deal because it did not give
unionists enough concessions.
Robinson said he would now look to gain the support of the community and the smaller assembly parties for the deal.
"We have a basis upon which we can go forward and recommend it [the deal] to our party, to the other parties in

The DUP now faces a struggle to ward off the TUV threat in the forthcoming general election. Allister will portray the

Northern Ireland agrees power-sharing deal
Gordon Brown hails historic deal which will see justice and policing powers be devolved to Stormont from 12 April

Justice and policing powers will be devolved to Northern Ireland <http://www.guadian.co.uk/uk/northernireland> 's
power-sharing government from 12 April in a historic deal agreed by the main parties that "opens a new chapter" after
decades of violence, Gordon Brown said today.
Standing alongside his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, at a press conference at Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast, the
prime minister said the "inspirational" agreement between Sinn Fein <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/sinn-fein>
and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/dup> was a foundation for lasting peace.
The deal —finally agreed to by the DUP <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/feb/05/northern-ireland-dup-ulster-
deal> last night and described as a final piece in the jigsaw after a long search for peace — comes after two weeks of
round-the-clock negotiations and brings an end to fears that the power-sharing government might collapse.
It will see policing and justice powers devolved from Westminster to the assembly within weeks and includes new plans
on overseeing parades.
Brown, who travelled to Belfast this morning, said the agreement had been possible because of "a new spirit of mutual
co-operation and respect".
The deal meets a key Sinn Fein demand and prevents the republican party from walking out of the power-sharing
executive. In return, the DUP has secured reforms to the way loyalist marches are handled in Northern Ireland, including
the abolition of the Parades Commission, a body most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists.
A cross-community vote will now be held in the Stormont assembly on 9 March before the policing and justice powers
are devolved from London on 12 April.
Brown told reporters: "The achievements have been as great as they are inspirational. This moment and this agreement
belongs to the people of Northern Ireland, all of the people, and now more than ever before so does their future ... This
is the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years of
talks, weeks of stalemate."
Cowen praised both unionists and nationalists for making "fair and balanced compromises" to bridge the divisions and
said the quality of the negotiations meant that the "devolved institutions can and will work".

The Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, said the deal would further isolate republican dissidents who have
launched three separate gun and bomb attacks against police stations in the province over the last 10 days. The deal
would "absolutely" make Northern Ireland a safer place, he said.
The DUP leader, Peter Robinson, said the agreement will be more enduring because of the time spent" in forming it.
Referring back to the Belfast Agreement of 1998 <http://www.nio.gov.uk/the-agreement> when negotiations bore fruit
at the 11th hour, the Sinn Féin president, Gerry Adams, described the current deal and the rescue of power-sharing as
"yet another very good Friday".
Jeffrey Donaldson told the Guardian the DUP's 36-strong assembly team was now unanimously in favour of the deal.
But the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) has yet to officially back the package which will allow the assembly to set up
legislation to change the way parades are judged.
A UUP spokeswoman said members wanted to see the proposed agreement before giving their response to the two
governments. "We have not had sight of this agreement and until we do we will not be signing up to it," she said.
The talks, which centred on Hillsborough Castle, outside Belfast, are the longest set of continuous negotiations held in
the near 20-year peace process. Sinn Fein had accused the DUP of stalling on the transfer of policing powers for the last
three years and it was feared that failure to find agreement could see the collapse of the power-sharing government led
by the two parties.
The agreement finally came near midnight at Stormont's parliament building. Earlier in the evening Sinn Fein had said
the basis of a deal was on the table and it was giving the DUP leadership the time to persuade its party to accept it.
Robinson emerged from a meeting of party colleagues to confirm that he had secured unanimous support for the
proposals. Earlier in the week up to 14 DUP assembly members had opposed a proposed deal because it did not give
unionists enough concessions.
Robinson said he would now look to gain the support of the community and the smaller assembly parties for the deal.
"We have a basis upon which we can go forward and recommend it [the deal] to our party, to the other parties in
Northern Ireland and to the community.
"An essential element of the Democratic Unionist Party's manifesto is the requirement for community confidence; we
believe this can be the basis for gaining that confidence."
However the leader of the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), Jim Allister, questioned why the 14 DUP rebels had
changed their minds.
"The deal hasn't changed, only the snowmen of the DUP, who melted once the heat came on," Allister said.
The DUP now faces a struggle to ward off the TUV threat in the forthcoming general election. Allister will portray the
deal as a sell-out of unionist principles and a sop to republicanism.

We commend the Honduran people for having exercised peacefully their democratic, sovereign and inalienable right to
select their leaders. The apparently large and enthusiastic turnout shows that given the opportunity to express
themselves, the Honduran people have viewed the election as an important part of the solution to the political crisis in
their country.
We look forward to continuing to work with all Hondurans and encourage others in the Americas to follow the lead of
the Honduran people in helping advance national reconciliation and the implementation of the Tegucigalpa-San Jose
Accord. Significant work remains to be done to restore democratic and constitutional order in Honduras, but today the
Honduran people took a necessary and important step forward.

Re: New developments on NI
Shaun regrets he cannot come here tomorrow. Here's the problem and the plan: Cameron is still quietly giving
encouragement to the Ulster Unionists, which, led by Reg Empey, are trying to scuttle the agreement somehow. So the
plan is for Shaunn to announce he will deliver a speech on Monday in the House of Commons presenting the
agreement—except that at the last second Gordon will step in on the floor for Shaun, requiring Cameron to respond,
theoretically forcing him to support the agreement. In his speech, Gordon will explicitly cite your role and support of the
US—among other things further cornering Cameron (and Empey). Shaun would like to speak with you soon depending
on how things are working out there, perhaps tomorrow (Sunday) or perhaps Monday (perhaps after Commons). Dinner
will be on a rain-check.

change. But if AM says no on Monday, Mitchell is open to changing it. If AM miraculously says yes, then they'll have the

They didn't admit they made a bad word choice - that's my interpretation.

Google's announcement on their blog:
A new approach to China
1/12/2010 03:00:00 PM
Like many other well-known organizations, we face cyber attacks of varying degrees on a regular
basis. In mid-December, we detected a highly sophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate
infrastructure originating from China that resulted in the theft of intellectual property from Google.
However, it soon became clear that what at first appeared to be solely a security incident--albeit a
significant one--was something quite different.
First, this attack was not just on Google. As part of our investigation we have discovered that at least
twenty other large companies from a wide range of businesses--including the Internet, finance,
technology, media and chemical sectors--have been similarly targeted. We are currently in the
process of notifying those companies, and we are also working with the relevant U.S. authorities.
Second, we have evidence to suggest that a primary goal of the attackers was accessing the Gmail
accounts of Chinese human rights activists. Based on our investigation to date we believe their attack
did not achieve that objective. Only two Gmail accounts appear to have been accessed, and that
activity was limited to account information (such as the date the account was created) and subject
line, rather than the content of emails themselves.
Third, as part of this investigation but independent of the attack on Google, we have discovered that
the accounts of dozens of U.S.-, China- and Europe-based Gmail users who are advocates of human
rights in China appear to have been routinely accessed by third parties. These accounts have not
been accessed through any security breach at Google, but most likely via phishing scams or malware
placed on the users' computers.
We have already used information gained from this attack to make infrastructure and architectural
improvements that enhance security for Google and for our users. In terms of individual users, we
would advise people to deploy reputable anti-virus and anti-spyware programs on their computers, to
install patches for their operating systems and to update their web browsers. Always be cautious
when clicking on links appearing in instant messages and emails, or when asked to share personal
information like passwords online. You can read more here about our cyber-security

recommendations. People wanting to learn more about these kinds of attacks can read this U.S.
government report (PDF), Nart Villeneuve's bloq and this presentation on the GhostNet spying
incident.
We have taken the unusual step of sharing information about these attacks with a broad audience not
just because of the security and human rights implications of what we have unearthed, but also
because this information goes to the heart of a much bigger global debate about freedom of speech.
In the last two decades, China's economic reform programs and its citizens' entrepreneurial flair have
lifted hundreds of millions of Chinese people out of poverty. Indeed, this great nation is at the heart of
much economic progress and development in the world today.
We launched Google.cn in January 2006 in the belief that the benefits of increased access to
information for people in China and a more open Internet outweighed our discomfort in agreeing to
censor some results. At the time we made clear that "we will carefully monitor conditions in China,
including new laws and other restrictions on our services. If we determine that we are unable to
achieve the objectives outlined we will not hesitate to reconsider our approach to China."
These attacks and the surveillance they have uncovered--combined with the attempts over the past
year to further limit free speech on the web--have led us to conclude that we should review the
feasibility of our business operations in China. We have decided we are no longer willing to continue
censoring our results on Google.cn, and so over the next few weeks we will be discussing with the
Chinese government the basis on which we could operate an unfiltered search engine within the law,
if at all. We recognize that this may well mean having to shut down Google.cn, and potentially our
offices in China.
The decision to review our business operations in China has been incredibly hard, and we know that
it will have potentially far-reaching consequences. We want to make clear that this move was driven
by our executives in the United States, without the knowledge or involvement of our employees in
China who have worked incredibly hard to make Google.cn the success it is today. We are committed
to working responsibly to resolve the very difficult issues raised.

A quick summary from Ibrahim; these comments were made prior to the FoLLow-Up Cty meeting,
which is now underway. -rw
In press statements this evening, NAR stressed that the PA and the PLO are committed to the
Arab position which will be developed in the meeting of the Arab Follow Up committee in
Cairo. In response to a question at the beginning of the meeting on President Abbas's
presentation to the committee, NAR said that the ideas that will be presented are not those
of President Abu Mazen but basically are about the US responses to the Palestinian questions
in relation to the role of Senator Mitchell in the 'proximity talks. He will also stress
that the Palestinian position will be the same as the Arab position.
He added that these ideas will be presented to the to the Arab Follow Up committee and we
shall see what the Arabs will say. And we will adhere to the Arab position completely
exactly as we did when we went to Annapolis and to Madrid peace conference. He said the
answer will be provided in the meeting. He went on to say that we have received some
responses from Washington to questions which President Abbas had raised. In response to a
question on whether the US answers constitute an appropriate ground to resume negotiations,
NAR said that the US wants to move the peace process forward and want to create a conducive
atmosphere to launch direct negotiations in the future. He said that the proposed proximity
talks essentially are based on Senator Mitchell continuing his trips between the Palestinians
and Israelis. As far as we are concerned, we shall abide by the Arab position. He also said

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767867 Date: 08/31/2015
we will not develop any position with respect to negotiations without Arab consensus whether
in terms of accepting or rejecting the US ideas.
With regards to resumption of direct negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis, WAR
said that there are no proposals (ideas) at present time to resume direct negotiations. He
said that the Arab and Palestinian position on this issue is clear; there needs to be a clear
TOR for negotiations and total cessation of settlement activities. He said that the PA
position in principle is not against negotiations. On the contrary its for negotiations that
do not waste time since the Palestinian national interest requires a solution as soon as
possible to create the independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as capital. WAR went on
to say that before talking about resumption of direct negotiations, there is a need to
clarify the basis of these negotiations and to know the fate of settlements and to what
extent will Israeli abide by freezing settlement activities.
With respect to Israeli provocations which seriously tamper with security and stability, WAR
said that Israel does not want a return to negotiations but wants to blame the Palestinians
by saying they don't want to enter negotiations. WAR went on to say 'It is imperative to take
away this pretext by exposing the real Israeli position to the international community and
the Us administration. He said we are ready to resume negotiations on clear basis but its
the Israeli side that places obstacles to avert meeting its commitments while blaming the
Palestinian side (as Israel is accustomed to doing).

Can you call Froman and discuss the cotton issue since I told the press--in response to a question--that I knew there
would be retaliatory actions announced next week and that a high level delegation would come from DC to make a
countervailing proposal w the hope of avoiding the imposition of the retaliation 30 days after they're announced. So
what are the odds of that working? Not high, I believe so this combined w refusal on Iran sanctions will lead to difficult
reactions from Congress toward Brazil. Then we have management problem on our hands.

Subject: RE: Insulza speech
On democracy, Insulza repeated his line from 2005 (actually taken from Condi Rice) that it was not enough to be elected
democratically; one had to govern democratically. He reviewed his own performance applying the Inter-American
Democratic Charter (IADC) over the past five years and concluded that the record was good. He conceded that he had
intervened too late in the Honduras case but said that was because Zelaya waited until too late to extend the invitation,
asserting that he cannot intervene without an invitation from the executive branch.
"The truth is that we did everything possible to restore democracy in Honduras," he said.
Insulza said the Honduras experience showed the OAS needs to develop "swifter and more flexible procedures" to allow
it to respond more preemptively. This would include mechanisms for the OAS to "make itself present in countries where
there are possible signs of instability."
Insulza committed to "unreserved support" for the OAS human rights mechanisms, while respecting their autonomy.
"Democracy is more than elections and includes such essential components as respect for human rights, freedom of
expression, separation and independence of the branches of government, respect for the rule of law and the democratic
institutional system, and transparency and honesty in government. It also establishes a link between democracy,
development, and equity," he said.
He talked about "modern multilateralism," modeled on the EU, as his vision for the OAS. "Modern multilateralism," he
said, eschews Cold War divisions and "we all work together to build on our common principles."
On the management side, Insulza claimed he had inherited a bad financial situation at the OAS and improved it.
Nonetheless, he said, "we need more resources." He committed to seek them from non-traditional sources such as OAS
observers, NG0s, the private sector and academia. He claimed his efforts to improve transparency and accountability
had been commended by external auditors.

Gibbs and Pi will/have deployed these:
• Some of the comments made yesterday by President Karzai are troubling and a cause for real concern.
• Together with our international partners, the United States is making great sacrifices and investing substantial
resources to defeat al Qaeda and its extremist allies, and to create opportunities for the Afghan people. As
President Obama has said, we have vital security interests in the region, and we are committed to helping
Afghanistan become strong, stable and prosperous.
• We would reiterate the commitments that both Presidents made during their visit last weekend. We are
discussing this with President Karzai and his Administration and we are seeking clarification of his remarks.

Subject: FW: Economist: The limits of freedom and faith
See the piece below on defamation of religion. Not bad.
http: I /www.economist.com/world/international/displavstorv.cfm?story id=15833005
Religion and human rights
The limits of freedom and faith
Mar 31st 2010
From The Economist print edition
Opponents of a bid by Muslim states to "protect religion" claim a small success
How dare you call us blasphemers?
IT DOES not happen often: Christian lobbyists, the sort who favour prayer in American classrooms and
crucifixes in Italian ones, lining up on the same side as secularists who battle to curb religion's role in the
public square. But in both those camps there has been some quiet satisfaction after a recent vote at the
United Nations. Not over the outcome, but over the slim margin of defeat.
On March 25th the Human Rights Council (HRC), a Geneva-based UN agency which often exasperates its
Western members, voted by 20 votes to 17, with eight abstentions, for a text that lists the "defamation of
religion" as an infringement of liberty. Nothing amazing there: the Organisation of the Islamic Conference
(OIC), which groups 56 mainly Muslim states (plus Palestine), has been working to push resolutions of
that kind through the General Assembly and other UN bodies since 2005. But the margin was the smallest
ever, and opponents think there could be a good chance of defeating a "defamation" motion next time one
comes around.
The OIC's idea is to establish the principle that faiths need protection, just as individuals do. It denies any
sinister intention (see article). And to some ears, the OIC's effort sounds like harmless UN-speak, but
nothing more. (The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, a congressionally
mandated body, has noted a logical flaw: defamation means harming the reputation of a living person or
entity: that implies that one can't defame an idea or a religious founder who is no longer, at least
physically, alive on earth.)
But critics of the OIC campaign, who include atheists, Christians and indeed some Muslims, say the
"defamation" idea is worse than hot air: far from protecting human rights, it emboldens countries that use
blasphemy laws to criminalise dissent. What encourages these critics is that more countries seem to be
coming around to their view. Mexico, Uruguay, Argentina, Zambia and South Korea voted against the
latest resolution. Brazil criticised the text but abstained.
Deeper still inside the UN's bureaucracy, another battle over religion rages—and the stakes could be even
higher. An "ad hoc committee" is mulling ways to amend or extend the UN convention on racial
discrimination. Certain states want language that would fuse the categories of race and faith; some want a
new convention, or a protocol to the existing one.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768055 Date: 08/31/2015
For secularists (in the broad sense of people, including believers, who oppose the idea of faith having
privileged access to power), all this is alarming. Non-binding resolutions against defamation are bad
enough; a UN treaty on race-plus-religion would have legal force, at least for its signatories, and give
heart to theocrats.
At the HRC's latest discussion of this effort in March, the Algerian who oversees the project was keen to
plough ahead. But countries like Switzerland, Japan, Mexico, Argentina and France retorted that it would
be better to enforce the existing UN norms than dream up new ones. Efforts to widen the racism accord
will resume, with a new chairman, late this year—but critics are relieved to have stalled it. Still, would-be
theocrats may now focus harder on adding to the racism charter, because they face a real risk of being
defeated over defamation, in the view of Roy Brown, Geneva spokesman for the International Humanist
and Ethical Union.
Meanwhile a Christian-inspired NGO, the European Centre for Law and Justice, has been denouncing the
abuse of blasphemy laws in many OIC member states. How fair is their point? It is an easy case to make,
for example, over Pakistan.
Some 41 complaints of blasphemy were registered by police in Pakistan last year, says that country's
independent Human Rights Commission. In theory, blasphemy is punishable by death—a penalty that has
been handed down but never carried out. Worst-hit by the law are minorities like Christians and Ahmadis,
a group whose claim to be Muslim is rejected by the Pakistani state. Although abuse of the law is less rife
now than in the 1980s, when an Islamist general tightened up the rules, the law is still invoked in disputes
(over property, say) that have nothing to do with faith.
"The most vulnerable people, that is religious minorities, continue to be charged with
blasphemy," said Ali Dayan Hasan, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, a campaign group.
"But are people convicted? No. Rarely. It is used as an instrument of political and social
coercion."
When convictions occur, they lead to long jail terms; and pre-trial detention can last for years. Pakistan's
parliament is revising the constitution but it has left intact the religious bits, despite a vow by the ruling
party to review the blasphemy laws. (Indonesia too has stepped back from a move to liberalise its
blasphemy regime.)
On Pakistani streets, the law has dire effects. In January 2009, in a village in Punjab province, five
Ahmadis, a labourer and four children, were charged with blasphemy. They had supposedly written
"Prophet Muhammad" on the wall of a mosque toilet. The children were behind bars for nearly six months
till the charge was quashed.
And last September a young Pakistani Christian was accused of throwing part of the Koran down a drain.
It seems that his real crime, however, was affection for a Muslim woman. A mob torched a church, and
many Christians had to flee. He was taken to jail, where he died a few days later. His family alleged
torture; the authorities claimed suicide. There was mayhem at the funeral and the country's Christians
(see picture) were appalled. In some places, it is not the "defamation" of faith that threatens rights but
measures that supposedly defend it.

Hi Jake,
You'll see that the Secretary's points for Ashton mention the idea of our sending an inter-agency expert team to Brussels
for the next few months to improve US-EU coordination on Iran sanctions prep. EU officials had been receptive, but
now the bureaucrats are saying this would be "counter-productive", and instead prefer more regular videoconferences.
Which is probably OK. Anyway, I just wanted you to know the background, in case it comes up in the Ashton meeting.

to the people. She said she personally wants to have a "high reputation" as a result of her democracy
efforts. MKA offered NDI's full assistance in organizing the elections Otunbayeva has pledged to hold in six
months. Otunbayeva expressed her appreciation, but did not make any specific requests. Interestingly,
Otunbayeva volunteered that Kyrgystan would keep Manas open. That is more forward leaning than what she
told our Charge yesterday; she told him that they would need to review the Manas agreement but would keep
it open pending that review. I thanked MKA for the readout and promised to pass it on to you. A memo and

Cuba leaders 'do not want' normal ties with US: Clinton
WASHINGTON, April 10, 2010 (AFP) - Cuba's leadership does not want to normalize ties with Washington because they
would "lose their excuses" for the country's economic stagnation, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Friday.
The United States maintains a decades-old trade embargo on the Americas' only one-party Communist regime, but
President Barack Obama took office last year offering to improve ties if President Raul Castro improved human rights.
Clinton however blamed Castro and his brother Fidel -- Cuba's leader from 1959 to 2008 -- for undermining
Washington's bid to improve relations.
Despite US efforts to "enhance cooperation," Clinton said that the Castro brothers "do not want to see an end to the
embargo and do not want to see normalization with the United States because they would then lose all their excuses for
what hasn't happened in Cuba in the last 50 years," Clinton said.
"I find that very sad, because there should be an opportunity for a transition" to democracy in Cuba," said Clinton, who
was answering a student's question during a visit to the University of Louisville in the state of Kentucky.
"The people of Cuba should have democratically elected leaders and a chance to chart their own future. But
unfortunately, I don't see that happening while the Castros are still in charge," the top US diplomat said.
Raul Castro officially became president in 2008 after his older brother was sidelined with serious health problems.
However Fidel, now 83, remains enormously influential in Cuban affairs.

Clinton also noted what she said was a growing acknowledgment from the international community that Havana was
cracking down on human rights.
"For the first time, a lot of countries that had done nothing but berate the United States for our failure to be more open
to Cuba have now started criticizing Cuba because they let people die," she said.
"Many in the world are now seeing what we have seen for a long time, which is a very intransigent, entrenched regime
that has stifled the opportunity for the Cuban people."
A leading political prisoner, Orlando Zapata, died in hospital February 23 after 85 days into a hunger strike protesting
Cuban prison conditions.
Two other Cuban dissidents -- cyber journalist Guillermo Farinas and doctor Darsi Ferrer -- are currently engaged in
hunger strikes demanding improved conditions.
According to the Cuban Commission on Human Rights (CCDHRN), an illegal but tolerated group on the island, there are
some 200 political prisoners in Cuba.
Raul Castro on April 4 vowed never to give in to the dissidents' demands, calling it "blackmail" organized by the United
States and Europe.
The Cuban president charged the United States and Europe with waging "an unprecedented publicity war" against
Havana allegedly supported by "major Western media."

Karl, Frank, Richard.,
I hope in the next few days we can focus on some of the themes in the following:
1. On 9 April, I had lunch in Kabul with expert on
Afghanistan now based at was on his way back B6
to Washington via a meeting in Paris with the French Political Director. He had just spend three
weeks in Kandahar and Gardez, his first visit since August last year. He came across as patriotic, but
deeply worried, speaking in a monologue, mostly in French.
OVERALL SITUATION
2. said that his assessment was that the overall situation had deteriorated sharply since his
last visit. The Taliban were stronger, and more confident, than ever. ISAF was inflicting heavy losses
on them, but the scale was as nothing compared with what the mujahideen had endured at the hands
of the Russians. Moreover, the change in rules of engagement — to prevent civilian casualties, and
fewer night raids — had been interpreted by the Taliban as signalling weakness on NATO's part. In
view, most of the East, and Kunduz, was effectively lost to the Taliban and their fellow
travellers. US forces in the East controlled the ground they occupied or passed over, but little more:
they were in a similar position to the Soviet Army. Moreover, the population did not want to back
them, and was resisting US attempts to set up tribal militias or implant US Special Forces in the
villages, did, however, acknowledge that he had heard that the US Marines in Helmand were
behaving much more sensitively towards the population than had been expected. But the situation in
Marjah was not good. Of course, the Marines held the ground, but violence would continue for
months or years. This did not offer the positive signal of momentum for which the Coalition had been
hoping.
KANDAHAR

3. aid repeatedly that he did not understand the strategy in Kandahar. The Taliban had
effectively penetrated, and largely controlled, a city of one million people. The ANP there were
largely Barakzai, and working for either or both of the Taliban or Ahmed Wali Karzai's network. AWK
was at the centre of a vast criminal enterprise: his brother-in-law was one of the largest drug
traffickers in the south. When I said that surely ISAF could gradually occupy the city, squeezing the
Taliban back and out, said he was not certain of that: he thought that there might well be quite
violent resistance from the Taliban. He was also dismissive of the ISAF strategy of "managing" AWK:
if the latter really did abandon his criminal ways, he would be dead. He would lose the protection of
his militias. In such situations, one could only move forward, or go into prison or exile: there was no
going back. AWK had just too many enemies to survive in Kandahar without the protection of his own
criminal networks, guess was that AWK would promise to be good, but in reality stick to his
old habits, and hope to profit from the action taken by ISAF against the Taliban. was
dismissive of efforts to empower Governor Weesa, who would not survive five minutes in Kandahar
without Western support and protection. Although Weesa came from the area, he had no power base,
and, with his Canadian nationality, was regarded by the Kandaharis as a foreigner.
4. was also sceptical as to whether ISAF could "shura" its way to success in Kandahar. On the
military side, he thought ISAF just couldn't generate the force densities necessary to control the city:
for example, he thought the Argandab would require getting on for 15,000 troops to control it
properly. The city of Kandahar would require some 10,000 fresh police, who were just not available.
NEXT STEPS
5. said he was worried about where the coalition was heading. The best that could be
expected was a messy stalemate in Kandahar, but the probability was, by the early autumn, an
outcome that would not look at all like success, wondered whether ISAF really did need to go
ahead with its plan to take Kandahar: in view, he was riding for a fall. I said that I did not see
how we could pull back now. The planners were well aware of the risks, but wanted to generate
positive momentum to enable a political process to take hold.
MAKING PEACE
6. said that, in his view, the only way out now was a negotiated peace with the Taliban and all
the other parties to the conflict. He thought that Pakistan would need to help Karzai and the
Americans open such a dialogue with the Taliban, but, sooner or later, both Pakistan and Karzai
would need to be moved to one side, and there would need to be direct talks between the Americans
and the Taliban. The Taliban would not make a final peace with Karzai, who had little credibility left.
Similarly, the senior Taliban leaders would need to be brought across the border into Afghanistan, to
get them out from under the control of the ISI. All this would need deception and trickery: for the first
time in his career, could see that diplomats were needed, in this case to finesse a delicate
process, involving multiple negotiations. Karzai would have to eased out, but gently and with plenty
of public respect.
7. said that there would need to be a cease-fire, and wondered why ISAF couldn't occupy the
high ground by being the first to offer such a move. There would also have to be frank discussions
about the withdrawal of foreign forces.
8. said that his main worry was that the Obama Administration would waste another year
ploughing on with a military campaign which could deliver stalemate at best, and a serious reverse at
worst. Then, with the 2011-12 Presidential election campaign getting going, the White House would
panic, handing the problem to Pakistan, and pull US troops out more quickly than the situation

merited. It was vital to get ahead of the curve, and start making preparations now for a messy
political process that could last months or years.
9. said that he had known from 2001 that the Western intervention in Afghanistan had been
fraught with danger. He had suspected then, and knew even more strongly now, that the Taliban
could not be defeated or even properly contained by military means. Once again, he was sick with
worry at the way things were going. He had thought that the Obama Administration had understood
that the solutions in Afghanistan were political, not military. He was trying to think how he and other
concerned experts could shock the Administration in getting a political grip on the situation: he was
considering a joint op-ed by a group of experts. The seriousness of the situation meant that such an
article would have to concentrate on essentials: much of the talk about counter-insurgency (in what
was an Afghan civil war) and development and governance was no more than "poetry".
10. I pointed out to the political difficulties for the US and other Western governments in
negotiating direct with the Taliban. Although the principle of a negotiated peace was accepted, more
or less, in Washington and London, there was a long way to go before politicians fully addressed
what that might involve. Hence the argument that we needed first to get on the front foot militarily. It
would help if the Taliban could be pinned down on politically neuralgic issues, such as women's rights
and social restrictions, said that, in a serious negotiation, he thought such undertakings could
be extracted from the Taliban: again, however, the sooner work started on that, the more chance of a
satisfactory result.
11. I told that much of this thinking coincided with the views expressed by the Foreign
Secretary in his article in The New York Review of Books of 29 April 2010 had missed the MIT
speech, as he had been in Kandahar). The UK election campaign meant that there was little that
could be done over the next few weeks, apart from making sure that incoming or returning Ministers
had the best possible advice. After the election, there was clearly a case for a good strategic
discussion between the British Prime Minister and the American President: we all needed to raise our
eyes from the urgent tactical preoccupations in the south to the really important strategic issues, of
harvesting political success from military progress.

Mon Apr 12, 2010 11:05pm 1ST
By Marc Frank
HAVANA (Reuters) - Communist Cuba is turning over hundreds of state-run barber shops and beauty salons to
employees across the country in what appears to be the start of a long-expected revamping of state retail services by
President Raul Castro.The measure marks the first time state-run, retail-level establishments have been handed over to
employees since they were nationalized in 1968.Barbers and hair dressers in telephone interviews from a number of
cities during the weekend said they would now rent the space where they work and pay taxes instead of receiving a
monthly wage.Those employees who do not wish to rent are being offered other jobs or retirement

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON
IRAQI NATIONAL ELECTIONS
I congratulate all the people of Iraq who participated in national elections today and over the past three days. There is
no better rebuke to the violent extremists who seek to derail Iraq's progress. Our thoughts and prayers are with the
families who lost friends and loved ones, and we salute the determination of the Iraqi people to reaffirm their
commitment to democracy and to charting their own future free of fear and intimidation.
Thanks to the efforts of the Iraq High Electoral Commission and the Iraqi Security Forces, which organized the voting and
ensured security at thousands of polling sites throughout the country, Iraqi men and women from all parts of the
country were able to go to the polls and choose their leaders freely.
I also would like to commend Ambassador Hill, General Odierno and all the U.S. civilian and military personnel who
supported this historic effort.
Iraqis have chosen a new government to lead their country at a critical time. In the coming months, we will work
together with Iraqi leaders as our partnership continues its transition to a primarily civilian focus, with the goal of
building a long-term, multidimensional relationship between our two nations - a relationship that will contribute to
stability in the Middle East and growing peace and prosperity in Iraq.

US civilians battle to help Afghanistan
By Matthew Green
Published: March 5 2010 22:43 I Last updated: March 5 2010 22:43
US State Department representative Christopher Harich (top left) and Kevin Melton
flank Haji Abdul Jabar as they discuss the restoration of a religious monument
Each morning this winter, Haji Abdul Jabar has packed a flask of home-brewed green tea for work. It's not frugality; he's trying to avoid
being poisoned. You can't be too careful: before leaving the house, he also straps a Smith & Wesson 9mm handgun into a holster
secreted in the depths of his robes. Seized with occasional fits of passion, Jabar has been known to whip out the gun during meetings.
He may be jumpy, but tactics like this are not entirely out of place in his line of work: as district governor, the 65-year-old has an
unenviable task — of wresting the Arghandab River Valley, one of the most dangerous places in Afghanistan, from the Taliban.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768432 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768432 Date: 08/31/2015
Viewed from the roof of Jabar's district headquarters, the sweep of the valley is at once beautiful - bleakly majestic - and charged with
menace. A distant range of low, dun-coloured hills defines the valley's opposite flank. Orchards of pomegranate trees, their branches
stripped bare by the cold, line the banks of a river meandering across the valley floor, dividing the east side of Arghandab from the
west.
The east is where Jabar's office is perched, and where US troops feel safer -
it's the west side they call "bad juju land". Insurgents use a strip of desert there
to infiltrate Kandahar, the birthplace of the Taliban in the mid-1990s, and the
pivot on which previous Afghan wars have turned. Roadside bombs hidden in
the lush vineyards last year turned Arghandab into a killing field. A battalion of
the 82nd Airborne Division deployed here in mid-December is hoping for better
luck, but a new showdown is coming. Stanley McChrystal, the Nato The district governor's office
commander in Afghanistan, has vowed to secure Kandahar. The Taliban want
It back.
One night, one of the insurgents called the governor's mobile. "He said, 'I'm going to kill you, you're working for the Americans,-says
Jabar, sitting on the carpet in his office. "I said, 'Do whatever you can do.' Then I abused him and hung up." Jabar normally cuts a
rather solemn figure. At this recollection, he laughed.
Jabar is not alone in his mission. Aside from the 2-508 battalion of the 82nd Airborne two Americans have arrived in Arghandab to help
out: 27-year-old Kevin Melton and 35-year-old Christopher Harich. They're part of the Obama administration's "civilian surge",
announced alongside a fresh build-up of US troops.
Working out of the whitewashed, two-storey district office, this unlikely trio aims to turn the tide of opinion in the district. They must do it
before spring, when the valley will come into leaf and the Taliban fighters return from Pakistan in time for the fighting season.
"Arghandab is the gate to Kandahar city," Jabar says. "If Arghandab is lost, Kandahar is also lost. It's the most important valley in
Afghanistan."
Haji Abdul Jabar and Kevin Melton of US Aid above the Arghandab Valley
Jabar, Harich and Melton have little in common but their beards. Melton, who grew up in the suburbs of Washington, is working for
USAid, the US governments development agency. Hard-driving and anxious to get results, Melton juggles a raft of plans for projects
from solar-powered lamps for villages, to schemes for hydroelectricity and renovating a shrine clinging to a nearby mountainside. His
past experience includes work in Sudan, but the challenge in Arghandab trumps anything he has previously attempted. "It feels like
there's no end to the day," he said. "It's physically, mentally, emotionally and intellectually exhausting."
Harich is a lawyer and a former marine from Louisiana who until recently worked as a policy adviser to the governor of West Virginia.
He now represents the US State Department in Arghandab. "I've no doubt in my mind that we're going to have a fight this summer," he
says. "When the Taliban come back in May, are they welcomed with open arms?"
Strapping on their khaki-coloured helmets and flak jackets and donning wraparound protective sunglasses whenever they leave the
base, Melton and Harich bear a distinct resemblance to the US soldiers who protect them.
Jabar, meanwhile, sports neck and wrist pouches containing Koranic charms to ward off the health risks caused by his high blood
pressure. (He takes advantage of the medic in the US military base adjacent to his office for regular check-ups.)
Both the Americans were lured by the challenge of participating in the US adventure in Afghanistan for a year. Sleeping in vacant
rooms in the district office and equipped with a V-Sat internet link to keep in touch with superiors in Kandahar city - but no shower -
they must figure out how to work with Jabar to build local government more or less from scratch. Harich aims to act as a "mentor",
helping Jabar as he works with the provincial government in Kandahar to assemble an administrative team to govern the district of
more than 55,000 people,

US Congress warns Cameron over danger of failed
Ulster police deal
Yes vote on Hillsborough agreement would see policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next
month
David Cameron has been given a stark warning from Washington that dissident terrorists will be "emboldened"
to intensify their attacks in Northern Ireland and millions of dollars of US investment will be threatened if he
fails to persuade the Tories' Ulster Unionist partners to endorse the final stage of the peace process.
In a sign of deep unease in Washington at the Tories' electoral pact with the UUP, a bipartisan group of US
Congress members have demanded Cameron must "aggressively" encourage his partners to endorse the deal in
a vote in the Northern Ireland assembly on Tuesday.
"At this defining moment in the peace process, it is crucial that all the political parties speak with one voice
about their shared future," the members of Congress wrote in a private letter to Cameron.
Without a unanimous vote, they said, the province's elected officials would be sending the wrong message to
the people they represent, and to the world.
"Dissidents are trying to destabilise the political institutions and turn the clock back ... These dissidents will
continue to be emboldened if they sense there is no political unanimity on the way forward ... The challenge of
bringing good jobs to Northern Ireland will be made more difficult if potential investors do not believe there is
political stability."
The letter by congressional leaders of the 41 million-strong Irish-American community has been passed to the
Guardian before the crucial vote on last month's Hillsborough agreement between Sinn Fein and the Democratic
Unionists.
A yes vote would see policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month in what the British
government has dubbed the final piece in the jigsaw of the 1998 Good Friday agreement.
The congressmen and women, whose views reflect the private misgivings of the US secretary of state, Hillary
Clinton, wrote to Cameron after learning that his electoral partners in Northern Ireland were voicing doubts
about endorsing the deal. Clinton is said to be alarmed that Cameron has either failed, or not bothered, to warn
the UUP of the dangers of obstructing the deal.
A Tory source said: "David Cameron has consistently made clear that we support the devolution of policing and
criminal justice powers ... We welcomed the agreement between the DUP and Sinn Fein. The final details are
for the parties in the executive, working as a four-party coalition, to decide. We hope that between now and
Tuesday any outstanding issues can be solved."

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768443 Date: 08/31/2015
The Hillsborough agreement was brokered last month under a system endorsed by the UUP when it was the
largest party in Northern Ireland. This says that any change must have the consent of 50% of both the nationalist
and Unionist communities and 50% of the assembly.
Sir Reg Empey, the UUP leader who was one of the architects of the Good Friday agreement, will meet his
party's executive tomorrow night to decide how to vote.
The deal could still be passed tomorrow without the support of the UUP because the DUP's 36 assembly
members account for more than 50% of the unionist bloc. But there are fears in Washington that a no vote from
the UUP, seen as a moribund force until Cameron breathed new life into it, would destabilise many members of
the DUP and undermine support for the devolution of policing and criminal justice powers.

UUP to vote against justice deal
Page last updated at 22:05 GMT, Monday, 8 March 2010 The Ulster Unionist Executive has endorsed the party's decision
to vote against the devolution of policing and justice powers to Northern Ireland.
The assembly is to vote on whether the powers should be devolved on Tuesday.
Earlier on Monday, the UUP accused Northern Ireland Secretary Shaun Woodward of political and emotional blackmail
ahead of Tuesday's vote.
Danny Kennedy said he had linked the vote to the anniversary of the murder of Constable Stephen Carroll.
The vote takes place exactly a year after the police officer was murdered by the Continuity IRA in Craigavon.
Mr Woodward said transferring justice powers on Tuesday would send an important message to those responsible for
his death and dissident republicans in general.
Bur Mr Kennedy, the UUP's deputy leader, said the secretary of state was guilty of "political and emotional blackmail"
and called on him to consider his position.
The UUP has been refusing to endorse the Hillsborough Agreement, insisting that matters such as education, parading
and "the dysfunctional nature of the current executive" must be addressed.
On Monday night, former DUP leader Ian Paisley said the UUP would be making a "colossal mistake" by not backing the
deal.
Mr Paisley was speaking to DUP members in Ballymena as he announced his retirement as MP for north Antrim.
The DUP selected his son, Ian Jnr, as its candidate in the forthcoming Westminster election at the same meeting.
Meanwhile,
It also suggested that 70% of unionists favour Northern Ireland politicians being in charge of policing issues, compared to
83% of nationalists.

Subject: Call From Qadhafi Staffer
Jeff,
Wanted to fill you in on a call I just received from key Qadhafi staffer Mabrouka al Sharef; she's the one who
initially flagged for us last week that there was GOL blowback to A/S Crowley's comments.
Sharef began by stating how much Libya valued the bilateral relationship with the US, how we had all worked for
years to improve things between our countries, "only to have it all ruined in one minute by your spokesman."
Sharef said she had sat in on meetings today with Qadhafi, PM Baghdadi, and Qadhafi chief of staff Bashir Saleh.
She said all were "angry and upset" that there had still been no apology from the USG for the "insult to the
Leader." I reviewed with her Crowley's March 5 comments, noting that he had clarified his remarks were off-hand
(I translated that in Arabic as "non-official.") I also briefed her on your and A/S Crowley's meeting with Aujali,
which she had clearly not yet heard about (which means Q most likely had also not been briefed on it). Sharef
said such a meeting was appreciated, but did not meet the Libyan demand for an apology. She said, repeatedly
throughout the conversation, "The Brother Leader is upset that no one from the USG has explained that this
spokesman was not speaking for them, and made clear that his comments were wrong, and apologized for them.
He expected behavior and words like this from Switzerland, not from the US." She noted that Q had remarked
that he had said nice things about President Obama during his meetings with people from the US Embassy ("You
reported that back to Washington, right"; I assured her we had), and was thus surprised that the USG responded
with "the words of gangsters!" Sharef repeatedly referenced NOC Chair Ghanem's meeting last Thursday with
the GM's from US oil companies: "We don't want to have to take measures against them, but such insults to the
Leader cannot stand. Why has the US not publicly distanced itself from Crowley and his comments?!" She

treated me to a lengthy detailing of Swiss criminality and violations of international agreements, and then said,
"But even the Swiss haven't said what your spokesman did!"
I reviewed again with her Crowley's March 5 comments, and noted that, as he is the spokesman for the State
Department, he is the correct person, in our view, to remark on the situation; it wouldn't be in keeping with USG
practice for someone other than the Department spokesman to comment (i.e. no distancing of the USG from
Crowley). I emphasized that the US was not involved, and did not want to be involved, in the Swiss-Libya dispute,
we just hope it is resolved soon. I stressed that the US values its relationship with Libya, and wants to continue
improving the relationship, and get past this unfortunate bad spot we currently are in. I asked if it would be
helpful if a senior USG official called Q to discuss issues of bilateral interest, and reinforce the importance of the
relationship. At first, she brushed off such an idea - "that won't be a public apology" - but at the end of our
conversation, returned to the idea, noting that it was interesting, and inquiring as to which USG official might
call. I said I didn't want to make any promises I couldn't keep; that I'd check with Washington and get back to her
with further details tomorrow. She reiterated that she liked the idea, and said we should discuss it further over
coffee tomorrow or Wednesday.
Sharef closed by mentioning that she "and most Libyans" are "hand in hand with the US ... we want a good
relationship with you, as we like you, you're not like the Europeans."
Appreciate your guidance as to whether I can discuss further details of possible call with Sharef tomorrow.
Thanks, and sorry our hosts are taking up so much of your time lately!,

Have you seen this story? I look forward to discussing.
Gates Says U.S. Lacks Strategy to Curb Iran's Nuclear Drive
By DAVID E. SANGER and THOM SHANKER
Published: April 18, 2010
WASHINGTON - Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has warned in a secret three-page memorandum to top White
House officials that the United States does not have an effective long-range policy for dealing with Iran's steady progress
toward nuclear capability, according to government officials familiar with the document.
Several officials said the highly classified analysis, written in January to President Obama's national security adviser, Gen.
James L. Jones, touched off an intense effort inside the Pentagon, the White House and the intelligence agencies to
develop new options for Mr. Obama. They include a revised set of military alternatives, still under development, to be
considered should diplomacy and sanctions fail to force Iran to change course.
Officials familiar with the memo's contents would describe only portions dealing with strategy and policy, and not
sections that apparently dealt with secret operations against Iran, or how to deal with Persian Gulf allies.
One senior official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the memo,
described the document as "a wake-up call." But White House officials dispute that view, insisting that for 15 months
they had been conducting detailed planning for many possible outcomes regarding Iran's nuclear program.
In an interview on Friday, General Jones declined to speak about the memorandum. But he said: "On Iran, we are doing
what we said we were going to do. The fact that we don't announce publicly our entire strategy for the world to see
doesn't mean we don't have a strategy that anticipates the full range of contingencies - we do."
But in his memo, Mr. Gates wrote of a variety of concerns, including the absence of an effective strategy should Iran
choose the course that many government and outside analysts consider likely: Iran could assemble all the major parts it
needs for a nuclear weapon - fuel, designs and detonators - but stop just short of assembling a fully operational weapon.
In that case, Iran could remain a signatory of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty while becoming what strategists call a
"virtual" nuclear weapons state.
According to several officials, the memorandum also calls for new thinking about how the United States might contain
Iran's power if it decided to produce a weapon, and how to deal with the possibility that fuel or weapons could be
obtained by one of the terrorist groups Iran has supported, which officials said they considered to be a less-likely
possibility.
Mr. Gates has never mentioned the memo in public. His spokesman, Geoff Morrell, declined comment on specifics in the
document, but issued a statement on Saturday saying, "The secretary believes the president and his national security
team have spent an extraordinary amount of time and effort considering and preparing for the full range of
contingencies with respect to Iran."

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768505 Date: 08/31/2015
Pressed on the administration's ambiguous phrases until now about how close the United States was willing to allow.
Iran's program to proceed, a senior administration official described last week in somewhat clearer terms that there was
a line Iran would not be permitted to cross.
The official said that the United States would ensure that Iran would not "acquire a nuclear capability," a step Tehran
could get to well before it developed a sophisticated weapon. "That includes the ability to have a breakout," he said,
using the term nuclear specialists apply to a country that suddenly renounces the nonproliferation treaty and uses its
technology to build a small arsenal.
Nearly two weeks ago, Mr. Obama, in an interview with The New York Times, was asked about whether he saw a
difference between a nuclear-capable Iran and one that had a fully developed weapon. "I'm not going to parse that right
now," he said. But he noted that North Korea was considered a nuclear-capable state until it threw out inspectors and,
as he said, "became a self-professed nuclear state."
Mr. Gates has alluded to his concern that intelligence agencies might miss signals that Iran was taking the final steps
toward producing a weapon. Last Sunday on the NBC News program "Meet the Press," he said: "If their policy is to go to
the threshold but not assemble a nuclear weapon, how do you tell that they have not assembled? I don't actually know
how you would verify that." But he cautioned that Iran had run into production difficulties, and he said, "It's going slow -
slower than they anticipated, but they are moving in that direction."
Mr. Gates has taken a crucial role in formulating the administration's strategy, and he has been known over his career to
issue stark warnings against the possibility of strategic surprise.
Some officials said his memo should be viewed in that light: as a warning to a relatively new president that the United
States was not adequately prepared.
He wrote the memo after Iran had let pass a 2009 deadline set by Mr. Obama to respond to his offers of diplomatic
engagement.
Both that process and efforts to bring new sanctions against Iran have struggled. Administration officials had hoped that
the revelation by Mr. Obama in September that Iran was building a new uranium enrichment plant inside a mountain
near Qum would galvanize other nations against Iran, but the reaction was muted. The next three months were spent in
what proved to be fruitless diplomatic talks with Iran over a plan to swap much of its low-enriched uranium for fuel for a
medical reactor in Tehran. By the time Mr. Gates wrote his memo, those negotiations had collapsed.
Mr. Gates's memo appears to reflect concerns in the upper echelons of the Pentagon and the military that the White
House did not have a well-prepared series of alternatives in place in case all the diplomatic steps finally failed. In fact,
just before Mr. Gates issued his warning, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, wrote an official
"chairman's guidance" to his staff saying that while any military option would have "limited results" against Iran's
nuclear facilities, preparations needed to be stepped up.
"Should the president call for military options, we must have them ready," the admiral wrote.
Administration officials testifying before a Senate committee last week made it clear that those preparations were under
way. So did General Jones. "The president has made it clear from the beginning of this administration that we need to be
prepared for every possible contingency," he said in the interview. "That is what we have done from day one, while
successfully building a coalition of nations to isolate Iran and pressure it to live up to its obligations."
At the same hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Lt. Gen. Ronald L. Burgess Jr., director of the Defense
Intelligence Agency, and Gen. James E. Cartwright, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and one of the military's
most experienced officers on nuclear matters, said that Iran could produce bomb-grade fuel for at least one nuclear
weapon within a year, but that it would probably need two to five years to manufacture a workable atomic bomb.

You'll be happy to know that the Secretary's video message was the subject of a great op-ed in today's Thai
Rath the leading newspaper in Thailand. They took exactly the line that we hoped they would — seeing her
message not as the U.S. intervening in politics, but, rather, as a very personal message from someone who
cares deeply about Thailand. The writer even referred to the Secretary's autobiography.
Thai Rath (leading Thai language daily), a commentary on Thai politics, April 16, referenced
Secretary Clinton's video statement calling for a peaceful solution to Thailand's political crisis: "I
would like to thank U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for making a request herself and on behalf
of President Obama for the two opposing parties to return to the negotiating table so as to end their
conflict. The short video message in which she mentioned Thailand was full of sincerity. She started
by saying that she was making this request as "a long-standing friend of the Thai people" She
referred to the Songkran festival which is the Thai New Year and said the opposing parties should
consider this an opportunity for a new round of talks. She emphasized that violence cannot bring
happiness and peace and that the opposing parties should talk in order to solve the problem. I
believe Mrs. Clinton said this with sincerity. I have read a book in which she wrote about her brief
visit to Thailand as First Lady several years ago and showed her goodwill toward the Thai people and
Thailand in the book. During her most recent visit to Thailand last year, Mrs. Clinton gave an
interview and expressed her opinion about Thai politics in the most amicable way. Normally, I do not
quite approve of the U.S. because I think it often meddles with other countries' affairs. But I
wholeheartedly agree with Secretary Clinton's request and would like to sincerely thank her for
it." (To see the video, click here. To read the original article in Thai, click here.)

Senator John Kerry: "The Global Health Initiative has rightly identified several core principles that should guide our
thinking.... I hope they will provide the underpinnings for strong bipartisan support going forward for advancing
global health and strengthening the fight against HIV/AIDS."
Bill Gates:
"I believe GHI is an important next step — indeed a natural progression — in U.S. efforts to address health challenges
around the world."
"I am pleased that the GNI will include an increased emphasis on family health and the myriad of interventions that,
when taken together and integrated in both approach and execution, make families healthier and societies more
productive."
"...the GHI aims for greater resources and a fresh approach to deploying resources in order to maximize health
outcomes in as short a time as possible. It seeks to concentrate resources in order to better achieve scale in selected
countries. And it utilizes targeted funding increases on diseases and conditions that have a devastating health and
economic impact on countries yet are entirely preventable or treatable. These are laudable goals."
"I'm pleased that the Global Health Initiative aims to build off of and improve successful American platforms such as
PEPFAR and PMI, and that it will enable a more integrated approach to health both here in Washington, D.C., and on the
ground — where we lose patients if we can't address their needs comprehensively."
"Yet 9 million children dying unnecessarily each year is still 9 million too many. I believe that a combination of
interventions, as suggested by the approach of the Global Health Initiative, can cut this figure in half again in well under
15 years."

UNAMA MANDATE RENEWAL & RUSSIAN DISCUSSION
On March 22 the Security Council renewed the UNAMA mandate by unanimous consent, but not without a short delay
at the request of Russian PermRep Churkin, who called for last-minute consultations prior to the adoption of the
mandate. Churkin took the floor in closed consultations to "begin an interactive dialogue" highlighting the drug problem
caused by Afghanistan's unabated poppy cultivation, noting it fuels domestic corruption and finances the Taliban.
Churkin's "dialogue" was triggered by a front-page Sunday New York Times article titled, "U.S. Turns a Blind Eye to
Opium in Afghan Town."
Following the adoption of the UMAMA mandate, the Russian Perm Rep took the floor in the chamber and noted Russian
support for the new UNAMA mandate which has "satisfactory language in all regards.' Churkin emphasized that the
Afghan-led policy of national reconciliation can not contradict past Council resolutions, including the sanctions regime,
and reminded that all who join the reconciliation program must lay down arms, pledge to uphold the Afghan
constitution and break ties with terrorist organizations. Churkin reminded Members that drugs represent a "direct
threat to international peace and security" and noted that "recent media reports" state that ISM has "given up" on
eradication. He called for ISAF to be "active and robust" in combating drugs.

Dear Cheryl —
It's our understanding that the review of the terrorist list undertaken at the beginning of the year is reaching
completion, imminently. Jim asked me to shoot you a note that this continues to be a very important issue for him and
Bill Delahunt. The list needs to be purged of political manipulation — and quite frankly, the current status quo with Cuba
needs to be broken, not further reinforced — for the sake of Alan Gross, those on the island needing space to voice their
views, and indeed, all of us outside who know change is coming.
It's time to do something bold and constructive — and in our very best interests —

Dear Cheryl —
Attached please find a letter regarding the review of terrorist lists currently taking place within the Obama
Administration. The letter cites Cuba as a nation that should be purged from such lists, including the State Sponsors of
Terrorism list, as an example for the need of a thorough, robust and judicious review and updating of these lists.
Can you please ensure that the Secretary and other relevant State Department officials are made aware of this letter?

Marshall Fund (Ron Asmus), and Ambassador Holbrooke has attended every year. His presence
this year consists of two things: 1) bilat meetings including those with EU High Rep
Catherine Ashton, Codel Casey, Nato Sec Gen Rasmussen, Ambassador Daalder, and Ambassador
Kennard (some with Mullen); and 2) an internationally televised BBC discussion on Afghanistan
and Pakistan with Admiral Mullen. The panel will be shown live and broadcast on BBC World

From Ben Smith today:
Schumer: Obama's 'counter-productive' Israel
policy 'has to stop'
New York Senator Chuck Schumer harshly criticized the Obama Administration's attempts to exert pressure on
Israel today, making him the highest-ranking Democrat to object to Obama's policies in such blunt terms.
Schumer, along with a majority of members of the House and Senate, signed on to letters politely suggesting the
U.S. keep its disagreements with Israel private, a tacit objection to the administration's very public rebuke of the
Jewish State over construction in Jerusalem last month.
But Schumer dramatically sharpened his tone on the politically conservative Jewish Nachum Segal Show today,
calling the White House stance to date "counter-productive" and describing his own threat to "blast" the
Administration had the State Department not backed down from its "terrible" tough talk toward Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
Schumer, a hawkish ally of Israel since his days as a Brooklyn Congressman, described "a battle going on
inside the administration" over Middle East policy.
"This has to stop," he said of the administration's policy of publicly pressuring Israel to end construction in
Jerusalem.
"I told the President, I told Rahm Emanuel and others in the administration that I thought the policy they took to
try to bring about negotiations is counter-productive, because when you give the Palestinians hope that the
United States will do its negotiating for them, they are not going to sit down and talk," Schumer told Segal.
"Palestinians don't really believe in a state of Israel. They, unlike a majority of Israelis, who have come to the
conclusion that they can live with a two-state solution to be determined by the parties, the majority of
Palestinians are still very reluctant, and they need to be pushed to get there.
"If the U.S. says certain things and takes certain stands the Palestinians say, 'Why should we negotiate?"
Schumer said.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768665 Date: 08/31/2015
Schumer described the recent confrontation over construction in Jerusalem as a "kerfuffle."
"Israel apologized and when Biden left, and Biden is the best friend of Israel in the administration
[and] everything was fine," Schumer said. "But then what happened is the next day Hillary Clinton
called up Netanyahu and talked very tough to him, and worse they made it public through this
spokesperson, a guy named Crowley. And Crowley said something I have never heard before, which is,
the relationship of Israel and the United States depends on the pace of the negotiations."
Schumer was referring to State Department spokesman PJ Crowley's description of Clinton's conversation with
Netanyahu, in which he said that Clinton "made clear that the Israeli government needed to demonstrate not just
through words but through specific actions that they are committed to this relationship and to the peace
process."
"That is terrible," Schumer said today. "That is the dagger because the relationship is much deeper than the
disagreements on negotiations, and most Americans—Democrat, Republican, Jew, non-Jew—would feel that. So
I called up Rahm Emanuel and I called up the White House and I said, 'If you don't retract that statement you
are going to hear me publicly blast you on this," Schumer said.
Schumer said the White House had backed off that statement, but that now "many of us are pushing back, some
of the Jewish members will be meeting with the President next week or the week after, and we are saying that
this has to stop."
"You have to show Israel that it's not going to be forced to do things it doesn't want to do and can't do. At the
same time you have to show the Palestinians that they are not going to get their way by just sitting back and not
giving in, and not recognizing that there is a state of Israel," Schumer said. "And right now there is a battle
going on inside the administration, one side agrees with us, one side doesn't, and we're pushing hard to make
sure the right side wins and if not we'll have to take it to the next step."
The full transcript of Segal's interview with Schumer is after the jump.
Chuck Schumer Interview with Nachum Segal 4/22/10
Nachum Segal: Straight to what has become one of the most concerning issues in the Jewish Community
certainly, and for anybody in the United States, and anywhere in the world who cares somewhat, or more,
about Israel. There is a perception that the White House and Jerusalem are not enjoying the same type of
relationship that the White House and Jerusalem have enjoyed in the past. Need we be concerned?
SCHUMER: Well of course we should be concerned, and the thing we should most be concerned about, of
course, the threat to Israel...I mean it always changes but it's always there it seems to be the fate if Israel and
it seems to be the fate of the Jewish people. Right now what are the threats? I would rank them in this order:
Greatest threat- Nuclear Iran, obviously as Netanyahu has said that's an existential threat. Second greatest
threat- SCUDs in Syria these are rockets
that can go four or five hundred miles and carry a bigger payload and could be launched by Hezbollah and hit
any part of Israel far more damaging and devastating than the katyusha rockets. And third actually is what
everyone is focused on, which is the disagreements
between the United States and Israel, very real, on how to sit down and negotiate with the Palestinians. The
irony is Nachum, on the first two, if you talk to the Prime Minister if you talk to the Israeli military, US-Israeli
cooperation continues strong and
hand in glove. Both the US and Israel greatly fear a nuclear Iran, and there are very serious discussions going on
as to how to deal with it. We in the Congress Senator Lieberman and myself, Senator Bayh, are working up our
sanctions bill, which even if the
UN sanctions are weak we could have unilateral sanctions by the United States, for instance, if you cut of

gasoline. Iranians do not produce their own gasoline, and by the way the Iranian people are ready to rebel and
overthrow this regime, and if we would
squeeze them economically that could happen.
SEGAL: If in fact all this is true, and let's assume there is no reason not to believe that it's true, that in fact
Israel and the United States continue the same cooperation level they have had in the past, and we
know that when it comes to serious matters, especially military matters, it's been great cooperation, Why
wouldn't the President of the U.S. want that perception to be out there? Why would he want to alienate so many
who care about Israel.
SCHUMER: Nachum this is the question I talked to Rahm Emanuel about, and the President about this week. I
told the President, I told Rahm Emanuel and others in the administration that I thought the policy they took
to try to bring about negotiations is counter-productive, because when you give the Palestinians hope that the
United States will do its negotiating for them, they are not going to sit down and talk. Palestinians don't really
believe in a state of Israel,
they, unlike a majority of Israelis, who have come to the conclusion that they can live with a 2-state solution to
be determined by the parties, the majority of Palestinians are still very reluctant, and they need to be pushed to
get there. If the U.S. says
certain things and takes certain stands the Palestinians say, "Why should we negotiate?" So that's bad and that
should change and we are working on changing it. But the other two are very good, according to both the Israeli
government and the Israeli military
and the U.S. government. But we should make that known, why don't they? I asked them to do just that, I said
we should make it public because it will, at least, give people, who are supportive of Israel, Jew and non-Jew
alike, a little bit of solace.
SEGAL: That I agree with. But then you see the Gates memo which has become its own sort of entity out there,
and you wonder about what type of support the United States could give Israel if, god-forbid, they were
attacked by Iran.
SCHUMER: I do think that this administration, like previous ones, realizes a nuclear Iran is devastating and is a
very bad thing. By the way, not just for Israel but for the whole Middle-East and for world peace and
I think they're working strenuously to avoid it. They are having more success in this area than the previous
administration, they are trying to get some of the Europeans, and even the Russians and Chinese to impose
sanctions, but we are moving in the Senate
and the house to achieve any unilateral action that the U.S. can take. If we tell any major oil company that if
they sell gasoline to Iran, directly or indirectly, they can't sell any oil product in the U.S., then they will stop
selling gasoline to Iran and
the Iranian economy will have real problems. This will, at the very minimum, divert the leadership from their
nuclear strategy and could bring down the regime. This is important and good. Let's talk about the bad. Let's
talk about, what I'm sure your listeners
are most aggravated about, is what's happened in the last while in Israel. Let me say this: things were going
pretty well, until a couple of months ago, for this reason—the Netanyahu administration, with money from the
U.S., had gotten the PA on the west bank
to have their own police force and have them come down on the terrorists , for their own self interest not to
protect the Jewish people. It has worked, not only are there fewer killings of Jews on the Israeli side of the
fence, but there are many fewer in
the other side because there is a Palestinian police force and they have put those terrorists in line. As a result
Israel has been able to take down 27 of the checkpoints and as a result of that there is some economic growth in
the west bank. Its growing at
7-8%, Netanyahu brags that -- when he came here I spent a lot of time with him – That there are multiplex
theatres in places like Ramallah and Janeen. At the same time that is happening, there is prosperity with the
more moderate Palestinian Authority in the

west bank, and Hamas in Gaza is being squeezed and people there are doing very badly. Not only because Israel
has blocked off the border and not let anything into Gaza, and I support Israel in doing that, and it may be tough
on the Palestinian people, but
when they vote for Hamas they are going to have to suffer the consequences. But also because Egypt is
preventing all the tunnels from going under the Gaza-Egyptian border, not so much because they want to help
Israel but they don't want the terrorists infiltrating
from Gaza into Egypt. So the Palestinians were beginning to see those who talked about living in coexistence
with Israel, and not terrorism, and not wiping it out, such as the PA on the west bank would do better, and those
who talked about destroying Israel,
and shooting rockets into it were doing horrible.
SEGAL. I don't think the checkpoint and open highway point is one we are going to agree on Senator. But I
want to move to another hot point which is Syria, it seems, and I'm not sure how many people would consider
these confirmed reports or not and I'm sure you know more about this than I do, but Syria is making sure that
Hezbollah, north of Israel is being armed with SCUD missiles at this point. And you know that Washington is
making efforts to try and strengthen the
diplomatic relationship with Syria. Do you think that's outrageous?
SCHUMER: I do, and think that's stopped. They are working very hard to put pressure on the Syrians both
diplomatic and then maybe economic, to stop this and it's intolerable and that has to change. Let me just finish
this dialogue about Israel for a minute. All we have to do is leave things alone, and you might get the
Palestinians more willing to sit down and actually discuss peace because they would see the contrast. When
Biden was in Israel and there was this kerfuffle
over settlements which is in Israeli Jerusalem 5 minutes from downtown and should never have been an issue to
begin with, but they probably shouldn't have made the announcement when Biden was there. But Israel
apologized and when Biden left, and Biden is
the best friend of Israel in the administration everything was fine. But then what happened is the next day
Hillary Clinton called up Netanyahu and talked very tough to him, and worse they made it pubic through this
spokesperson, a guy named Crowley.
And Crowley said something I have never heard before, which is, the relationship of Israel and the United
States depends on the pace of the negotiations. That is terrible. That is the dagger because the relationship is
much deeper than the disagreements
on negotiations, and most Americans—Democrat, Republican, Jew, non-Jew--would feel that. So I called up
Rahm Emanuel and I called up the White House and I said, "If you don't retract that statement you are going to
hear me publicly blast you on this."
Of course they did retract it. Now what's happened, and many of us are pushing back, some of the Jewish
members will be meeting with the President next week or the week after, and we are saying that this has to stop.
You have to have, in terms of the negotiations,
you have to show Israel that it's not going to be forced to do things it doesn't want to do and can't do. At the
same time you have to show the Palestinians that they are not going to get their way by just sitting back and not
giving in, and not recognizing
that there is a state of Israel. And right now there is a battle going on inside the administration, one side agrees
with us, one side doesn't, and we're pushing hard to make sure the right side wins and if not we'll have to take
it to the next step.
SEGAL: You know Senator Schumer, the perception among New York state residents, and I'm one of them as
you know, is there likely is no one closer in the Senate to the President than you.
SCHUMER: That's not quite true, but I have an ear and frankly I spent time on the phone just yesterday talking
to him about this, and telling him that I didn't quite understand the United States policy, because even
if the goal is to bring about talks of peace, it was counter-productive because it's encouraging the Palestinians
not to sit down.

SEGAL: More than % of the Senate, including a lot of democrats, signed the letter to Sec. of State Clinton
rebuking the administration for these confrontational stances toward Israel. Were you surprised that names
like Kerry, Dodd, Durbin, Leahy and Reid were not included in that letter?
SCHUMER: well I think Senator Reid signed the letter, some didn't sign but the majority of both parties signed.
And we'll have other letters and other meetings to keep pushing that. I think you can say there are a
handful of people who are not sympathetic to Israel in the Senate of each party, but 90% of the Senate is
overwhelmingly in support of Israel. And one of my jobs, as you know is to rally those forces to do strong poll
work for this year (couldn't hear this
part perfectly). Believe me I think the policy has to change, and I'm working hard to make it change and I think
it will. Every administration at the beginning has this view even Ronald Reagan, the best friend Israel ever had,
do you remember his first 2 years?
When George Schultz wanted to sell AWACs to Saudi Arabia? Every administration has this idea to talk tough
to Israel and make nice to the Arabs and the Palestinians and that's the way to bring about peace. It's counter-
productive, it's actually the
opposite. The only way the Palestinians will sit down and talk is if they know Israel and the United States are as
close as could be. And each administration learns it. Schultz had to learn it and Reagan had to learn it. Clinton
did it in the early years and
later became a very good friend of Israel. George Bush the first did it and never got over it, (SEGAL laughing
muffles SCHUMER). We are at a crucial moment here and I am hopeful that administration will see the right
way to go. I am working on it. I don't believe
that have made any definitive decision, and as I have said on both Iran on Syria there is close cooperation, you
can check with your Israeli contacts Nachum and they will confirm that. So we just have to get this third part
right and I'm working hard to do
it and I'm optimistic that that can happen.
SEGAL: Good to hear that. Finally Senator, just for our own curiosity, just like the most recent justice
appointed to the Supreme Court, will the next one also be a New Yorker?
SCHUMER: I don't know. I would like it to be, I recommended the first one. I have 3 criteria for Supreme
Court Justices: they should be legally excellent, they should be moderate as is typical of my politics I don't
want too far right or far left, and diversity, which means different ethnic groups and everything else. Luckily in
terms of Jewish people we have good representation in terns of the Supreme Court. That will continue. One
thing I want to assure your listeners
Nachum, my name as you know comes from a Hebrew word. It comes from the word shomer, which mean
guardian. My ancestors were guardians of the ghetto wall in Chortkov and I believe Hashem, actually, gave me
name as one of my roles that is very important in the
United States Senate to be a shomer to be A. a shomer for Israel and I will continue to be that with every bone
in my body for of the other is against me.
SEGAL: can I ask you one other favor Senator? To be a shomer against the value-add tax?
SCHUMER: I am against it. I'm not sure it's needed but I will be a shomer against it.
SEGAL: always a pleasure Senator, thanks so much for joining us.
SCHUMER: Nachum, nice to see you and I hope you readership continues to go in peace and prosperity.

U.S. Revises Tack on Mideast Arms
Washington, Egypt Discuss Plan to Rid Region of Nuclear Weapons, in Effort to Steal Iran's Thunder at U.N. Conference
By JONATHAN WEISMAN, JAY SOLOMON and JOE LAURIA
The U.S. is negotiating with Egypt a proposal to make the Middle East a region free of nuclear weapons, as the U.S. seeks
to prevent Iran from derailing a monthlong U.N. conference on nuclear nonproliferation that begins Monday.
U.S. officials familiar with the move call it an important step in assuring countries that Washington—criticized by some
for its silence about Israel's undeclared nuclear arsenal—will equitably address weapons proliferation across the region, as
Iran seeks to shift focus away from its own nuclear program.
Washington also reassured Israel it won't foist a nuclear-free zone on the region until all parties agree to it and significant
progress has been made on Mideast peace.
The U.N. conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which is held every five years, is expected to begin with a
bang Monday with an address by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has condemned the West for its refusal
to disarm and for tacitly accepting Israel's nuclear capability.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will follow the Iranian leader in the afternoon.
The U.N. talks come at a time when Iran is believed to be heading toward a nuclear capability and the U.S. and allies have
been pressing for new, tough Security Council sanctions to curb Tehran's program.
"The Iranians are clearly intending to spoil the party," said a senior U.S. official involved in the nuclear diplomacy. The
official highlighted the importance of raising Mideast nuclear-free zone issues.
The designation of the region as a zone free of weapons of mass destruction was a nonbinding agreement that emerged
from a 1995 U.N. review of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, a 1970 pact to limit the spread of nuclear weapons. That 1995
agreement was pivotal because it won the indefinite extension of the treaty, but no action on the zone has been taken
since.
Senior Obama administration officials said Friday the White House is willing to significantly advance a Mideast nuclear
weapons-free zone, and would support a conference on the subject at a future date. U.S. officials said talks with Egypt
would resume in New York in the coming month. Such a zone is envisaged to include Israel, the Arab states, Iran and
Turkey.
"We've made a proposal to them [Egypt] that goes beyond what the U.S. has been willing to do before," said the senior
U.S. official involved in the nuclear diplomacy.
U.S. officials stressed, however, that they didn't believe that would happen without first achieving major advances in
Arab-Israeli peace talks.
"We are concerned that the conditions are not right unless all members of the region participate, which would be unlikely
unless there is a comprehensive peace plan which is accepted," said Ellen Tauscher, undersecretary of state for arms

control and international security. She said the U.S. has also discussed the zone with the Arab League and other members
of the Nonaligned Movement.
The diplomacy could raise new tensions between President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu if Washington is seen backing away from its commitment to Israel. Israel has voiced concerns that the U.N.
conference could turn into an international forum to corner Israel. Mr. Netanyahu backed out of a nuclear-security
conference in Washington in March due to such concerns.
An Israeli official said Friday that his government supports a Middle East freeze of WMD and nuclear weapons, but that
"it should be the culmination of a process that begins with bilateral and individual peace agreements between all the
countries in the region."
The U.S. and Israel have been locked in a monthslong spat over Mr. Obama's calls for a complete freeze in building new
Jewish housing in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. U.S. officials have grown increasingly confident in recent days that
ties between the U.S. and Israel have stabilized. Mrs. Clinton said Friday that the Mideast peace process will get on track
next week, though not the U.S.-brokered direct talks involving Israeli and Palestinians that the Obama administration
wants to see.
Egypt's latest proposal calls for Israel's disarmament "as soon as possible." It also called for Israel's nuclear program to be
placed under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.'s atomic watchdog. That proposal won't
be accepted, U.S. officials said.
The Egyptian working paper demands NPT signatory states release "all information available to them on the nature and
scope of Israeli nuclear facilities and activities, including information pertaining to previous nuclear transfers to Israel."
U.S. officials indicated no such demands could be made on Israel.
Arms-control analysts familiar with the talks say the U.S. is likely to propose creating a U.N. envoy given the task of
calling a conference of Middle East nations to press forward on the nuclear weapon-free zone.
"They are desperate to buy off Egyptian objections," said Henry Sokolski, executive director of the Non-Proliferation
Education Center and a critic of the Obama administration's arms-control approach.
Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, an advocacy group, said the U.S. acceptance of a
special envoy is a significant shift. A U.S. official refused to say whether the envoy proposal, first floated by Russia, was
part of the U.S. offer.
The last NPT conference in 2005 ended in collapse. But U.S. officials said they have been laying the groundwork for this
conference for nearly a year.
The White House wants rules to ensure that a country that withdraws from the treaty doesn't escape inspections and
sanctions. They also want more power for U.N. inspectors and more backing for multinational facilities that could help
nations develop peaceful nuclear power.

The word from Ramallah is quite positive. IF there are no announcements this week, we anticipate that the Arab League

Given the Israelis' warning, this is a real If.
Karl/Frank will go in today to walk Karzai through the particulars of the visit - the only thorny part is that it has dropped
from 4 to 3 days. But it has all the same elements, plus a dinner with Biden.
Did you see reports that Iran has dropped out of the running for the UNSC? Trying to confirm.
Andrew S. will be sending you a long memo that responds to DOD's pooling proposals - it conveys a desire to work
together with DOD on this and offers some alternative ideas. He also canvassed the building on other topics and will
send a list up for your book tonight. He and I agreed that the list should just be for reference and that your approach of
having informal conversation on the big topics is the right one.

Lugar: No more money for development banks until reform
Posted By Josh Rogin Wednesday, March 10, 2010
In the wake of the global financial crisis, a slew of multinational development banks are asking for large amounts of new
capital to both replenish and in some cases expand their resource pools, and much of the burden will fall on the United
States.
This creates a unique opportunity for the Obama administration to press these organizations to implement long-awaited
reforms, according to the Senate's top Republican on foreign relations, who has a big say in whether and how the
Congress doles out the funds.
"As the world struggles to emerge from the worst economic crisis since World War II, it is an appropriate time to ask
whether the [International Financial Institutions] are performing optimally and doing the jobs they should be doing,"
reads a newly released report by the staff of Sen. Richard Lugar, R-IN, "The crisis should not be used as an excuse to win
increases that could not otherwise be justified. As the requests for capital are negotiated with the international donor
community, there is a window of opportunity for significant reform."
The report, which is the culmination of six years of research, including half a dozen hearings when Lugar was committee
chairman, outlines several dozen recommendations for what the Obama administration, Congress, and the banks can do
to update their relevance.
"Does the world really need the IMF, World Bank, African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development, and Inter-American Development Bank today? Can they be changed to better
address our needs? How should we re-design them?" the report asks.
"Such questions are particularly timely because nearly all the IFIs have sought, or will soon seek, major new infusions of
money from their donors, including the taxpayers of the United States."
The Asian Development Bank has already asked the Obama administration for new funds, and the administration has
requested in its new budget $533 million in direct money and $12.8 billion in borrowing authority for the ADB.
A committee staffer told The Cable that Lugar wants to see progress on reform before he would support authorizing the
money.
"We want to make sure that before the American taxpayer puts more money in there that things are fixed," the staffer
said. "It's not possible for them to do everything, but they could certainly make progress."
The reforms the administration could press for in the short term include pressing the banks to focus more on
development goals rather than the structure and size of loans and "work with the other donor countries to step back
and slow down the process," the staffer said.

Congress is also concerned that the Obama administration might not be interested in pressing for these reforms,
considering that Obama issued a signing statement in June indicating he did not feel bound to follow congressional
direction on such international negotiations.
Negotiations between several banks and the Treasury Department are ongoing. The U.S. side is led by Scott Morris,
deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury's Office of International Development Finance and Debt.
The issue will next surface at the end of March when the Inter-American Development Bank convenes its annual
meeting in Cancun.

Also, I just saw on the schedule I was expected to speak for only 12 minutes. I think the speech as written is longer but I
haven't seen the final draft. Is there a teleprompter?
I also don't yet have any briefing materials. Will I get them tonight or tomorrow morning?

Prime Minister Vladimir Putin played the eco-warrior in Russia's Arctic on Thursday, helping scientists track endangered
polar bears and calling for a cleanup of the region.
Putin traveled to Franz Josef Land, an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean off the northwest coast of Russia's mainland in his
latest display of adventuring prowess to highlight the country's guardianship of the resource-rich region.
Wearing a bright red coat and cap, the 57-year-old premier kneeled at the head of a tranquilized polar bear to attach a
satellite-tracking collar, then helped elevate the beast for weighing. The images were broadcast nationally.
Putin helped measure the bear and roll it onto its side.

On his departure, he shook its paw and uttered the words: "Be well."
"The paw is heavy. This is the master of the Arctic, you can feel that straight away," Putin said.
Of a total 25,000 polar bears remaining in the wild, about 6,000 are in Russia's Arctic territory, Russian news agencies
quoted officials as saying.
Putin also called for "a general cleanup of the Arctic," ordering the removal of thousands of barrels of fuel buried in the
snow that had been left unused by a Soviet-era military base.
He has been spearheading Russia's re-emergence as a regional power, including the country's claims over the Arctic's
formidable natural resources. Some 90 billion barrels of oil and one-third of the world's undiscovered natural gas lie
hidden in the Arctic region, the U.S. Geological Survey estimates.
"Geopolitically, Russia's deepest interests are linked to the Arctic," Putin said. "Here Russia's security and defense
capabilities is provided for. Here there are vitally important transport communications."
Canada, the U.S., Russia and Denmark have competing claims before a United Nations commission regarding extend
their undersea boundaries into areas previously blocked by Arctic ice.
Moscow dramatically staked its claim to the region by dropping a flag on the ocean floor at the North Pole in 2007.
Since then, all four countries have agreed to cool their rhetoric and allow scientists to finish their surveys.
Putin adores the media spotlight when it accentuates his macho side. He has been photographed fishing bare-chested in
Russia's Altai region, and was shown on television diving into an icy river and swimming the butterfly stroke.
He has also tackled predators in the wild before, shooting a tiger with a tranquilizer gun and releasing leopards.

Jake, Huma: Could you let the Secretary know that I met with Chairman Reyes this afternoon at his request, to talk
about Tuesday's trip to Mexico and the High Level Group. He indicated he might be speaking with the Secretary very
soon on this. He was very pleased with the Secretary's leadership of such a high level delegation, the support for
President Calderon's efforts, and the attention Mexico and the border is now getting, and had spoken yesterday with
Secretary Napolitano. He stressed that he thinks we should be doing more for Mexico (he mentioned only wanting to
get funding for Mexican improvements to ports of entry). I ran intc going in as I was
leaving, expressed some frustration at Mexican positions during yesterday's meeting, but was extremely
grateful for the US participation and the Secretary's leadership. We agreed to get together very soon to review "action
items" coming out of the meeting.

Google to shut China search engine
By Richard Waters in San Francisco and Kathrin Hille in Beijing
Published: March 12 2010 20:11 I Last updated: March 13 2010 02:16
Google has drawn up detailed plans for the closure of its Chinese search engine and is now "99.9 per cent"
certain to go ahead as talks over censorship with the Chinese authorities have reached an apparent impasse,
according to a person familiar with the company's thinking.
In a hardening of positions on both sides, the Chinese government also on Friday threw down a direct public
challenge to the US search company, with a warning that it was not prepared to compromise on intemet
censorship to stop Google leaving.
The signs that Google was on the brink of closing Google.cn, its local search service in China, came two
months after it promised to stop bowing to censorship there. But while a decision could be made very soon, the
company is likely to take some time to follow through with the plan as it seeks an orderly closure and takes
steps to protect local employees from retaliation by the authorities, the person familiar with its position said.
Google is also seeking ways to keep its other operations in China going, although some executives fear that a
backlash from the Chinese authorities could make it almost impossible to keep a presence in the country.
When the search giant first promised to end censorship in response to what it claimed were a series of cyber-
attacks mounted from inside China, many China-watchers warned that its public defiance of Beijing would
provoke a stern response.
On Friday, Li Yizhong, minister for industry and information technology, said: "If [Google] takes steps that
violate Chinese laws, that would be unfriendly, that would be irresponsible, and they would have to bear the
consequences."

One person close to the search company, meanwhile, said that its senior executives remained "adamant" about
ending the censorship. The company has also ruled out keeping the search service going by handing majority
control, or even the entire business, to a local player, this person said.
Google's executives have made it clear that they still hope to stay in the country, whatever the fate of
Google.cn. "It's very important to know we are not pulling out of China," Eric Schmidt, Google's chief
executive, told the Financial Times at the time. "We have a good business in China. This is about the censorship
rules, not anything else."
The company's other operations, which pre-date the launch of Google.cn four years ago, include its research
centre in Beijing and a sales force that sells advertising on the Chinese-language Google.com search service,
based outside China, to advertisers inside the country.
Mr Li encouraged Google to continue its operations in the country. "[Google] has taken 30 per cent of the
Chinese search market.
"If you don't leave, China will welcome that, if you don't leave, it will be beneficial for the development of the
internet in China."

-Does this work for you?
Statement by the Secretary
Murders in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico
Today the men and women of the Department of State are mourning the murder of three people connected to the
United States Consulate General in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. One American consulate employee was killed along with her
husband, and the husband of a Mexican employee was also killed. I offer my deepest sympathies to the family, loved
ones and colleagues of these victims. The safety and security of our personnel and their families in Mexico and at posts
around the world is always our highest priority. I have spoken with our Ambassador in Mexico and we are working with
the Government of Mexico to do everything necessary to protect our people and to ensure that the perpetrators of
these horrendous acts are brought to justice.
These appalling assaults on members of our own State Department family are, sadly, part of a growing tragedy besetting
many communities in Mexico. They underscore the imperative of our continued commitment to work closely with the
Government of President Calderon to cripple the influence of trafficking organizations at work in Mexico. This is a
responsibility we must shoulder together, particularly in border communities where strong bonds of history, culture,
and common interest bind the Mexican and the American people closely together.

Subject: Quartet statement
Below is the final text of the Quartet statement, which Lavrov, Ban, and Ashton have now agreed to release *without a
call.* Sounds like your discussion with Lavrov did the trick:
The Quartet re-affirms that the current situation in Gaza, including the humanitarian and human rights situation of the
civilian population, is unsustainable, unacceptable, and not in the interests of any of those concerned. The Quartet
reiterates its call for a solution that addresses Israel's legitimate security concerns, including an end to weapons
smuggling into Gaza; promotes Palestinian unity based on the Palestine Liberation Organization commitments and the
reunification of Gaza and the West Bank under the legitimate Palestinian Authority; and ensures the unimpeded flow of
humanitarian aid, commercial goods and persons to and from Gaza, consistent with United Nations Security Council
resolution 1860 (2009). The Quartet declares its readiness to work closely with Israel, the Palestinian Government and
international donors in order to achieve sustainable economic development on the basis of the full implementation of
the Agreement on Access and Movement of 2005 and in the broader perspective of the two-state solution.
Consistent with these objectives, the Quartet and the Quartet Representative have worked with Israel, as well as
consulting the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, and other concerned parties, to effect a fundamental change in policy in
Gaza. The new policy towards Gaza just announced by the Government of Israel is a welcome development. The Quartet
notes that the elaboration of further details and modalities of implementation will be important in ensuring the
effectiveness of the new policy. Full and effective implementation will comprise a significant shift in strategy towards
meeting the needs of Gaza's population for humanitarian and commercial goods, civilian reconstruction and
infrastructure, and legitimate economic activity as well as the security needs of Israel. The Quartet will continue to work
with Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and other concerned parties to ensure these arrangements are implemented as
quickly as possible. The Quartet affirms that much work remains to achieve fully the solution stated above, and, in
consultation with the concerned parties, it will monitor closely the implementation of the policy in all its aspects. It will
actively explore additional ways to improve the situation in Gaza, encourage involvement of the PA at the crossings and
promote greater commerce between the West Bank and Gaza.
The Quartet stresses the importance of United Nations and other international interventions, as well as the work of local
non-governmental organizations, to be expanded in Gaza to meet urgent civilian needs, and calls on all parties to fully
enable this work.
The Quartet recognizes that Israel has legitimate security concerns that must continue to be safeguarded, and believes
efforts to maintain security while enabling movement and access for Palestinian people and goods are critical. The
Quartet commits to work with Israel and the international community to prevent the illicit trafficking of arms and
ammunition into Gaza. It urges all those wishing to deliver goods to do so through established channels so that their
cargo can be inspected and transferred via land crossings into Gaza. The Quartet emphasizes that there is no need for
unnecessary confrontations and calls on all parties to act responsibly in meeting the needs of the people of Gaza.
The Quartet also calls for an end to the deplorable detention of Gilad Shalit in advance of the fourth anniversary of his
capture on June 25; it further condemns the violation of Hamas' international obligation to provide him access by the
International Committee of the Red Cross and demands that Hamas immediately remedy the situation.
The Quartet also reiterates its support for proximity talks toward the resumption, without pre-conditions, of direct
bilateral negotiations that resolve all final status issues as previously agreed by the parties. The Quartet believes these

negotiations should lead to a settlement, negotiated between the parties within 24 months, that ends the occupation
which began in 1967 and results in the emergence of an independent, democratic, and viable Palestinian state in the
West Bank and Gaza, living side by side in peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours.

Subject: Ajad speech
Here's a basic summary:
It focused on citing the illegitimacy of US nuclear and nonproliferation policy, and on highlighting that it is the nuclear
weapons states which are to blame for both proliferation and global instability. The speech suggested that US
nonproliferation efforts are a cynical attempt to divert attention from our aim to keep nuclear weapons for ourselves
and that even things like the Nuclear Summit are nothing more than such a veil. The speech made several pointed
attacks on the USG, from the USAF's security issue a few years ago to our use of nuclear weapons in WWII (making us
"the most hated" in history) to allegations of support for terrorism (including that only states who have and have used
nuclear weapons could support nuclear terrorism). The speech offered 11 "proposals", most of which were previewed
in Tehran press today. These include legally binding NSAs, suspension of IAEA membership for those who threaten with
nuclear weapons, disarming all US nuclear bases, support for a ME w/o nuclear weapons and restructure of the UNSC.
The US del walked out -- with many partners -- in response to this speech.

Hi Jake,
You'll see that the Secretary's points for Ashton mention the idea of our sending an inter-agency expert team
to Brussels for the next few months to improve US-EU coordination on Iran sanctions prep. EU officials had
been receptive, but now the bureaucrats are saying this would be "counter-productive", and instead prefer
more regular videoconferences. Which is probably OK. Anyway, I just wanted you to know the background, in
case it comes up in the Ashton meeting.

Below is the Iran section of the chair's statement from Trieste. There is strong language on human rights; is that what
Miliband was referring to? The language on the nuclear issue reflects where we were last summer -- still on the first
track.
Iran
We are concerned about the aftermath of Iranian Presidential elections. We fully respect the sovereignty of Iran. At the
same time, we deplore post-electoral violence, which led to the loss of lives of Iranian civilians. We express our solidarity
with those who have suffered repression while peacefully demonstrating and urge Iran to respect fundamental human
rights, including freedom of expression, as ensured by the international treaties it has ratified. The crisis should be
settled soon through democratic dialogue and peaceful means on the basis of the rule of law. We call on the Iranian
government to guarantee that the will of the Iranian people is reflected in the electoral process.
We remain committed to finding a diplomatic solution to the issue of Iran's nuclear program and support renewed
efforts to that effect, such as the readiness of the U.S. to enter into direct talks and the invitation from China, France,
Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States to Iran to restart negotiations, as well as the constructive
involvement of other G8 partners in the process. We stress the need for unity of action on the basis of agreed policy. We
sincerely hope that Iran will seize this opportunity to give diplomacy a chance to find a negotiated solution to the
nuclear issue. At the same time we remain deeply concerned over proliferation risks posed by Iran's nuclear programme.
We recognise that Iran has the right to a civilian nuclear programme, but that comes with the responsibility to restore
confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear activities. We strongly urge Iran to cooperate fully with the
IAEA and to comply with the relevant UNSC Resolutions.
Our meeting on the margin of the United Nations General Assembly opening week next September, will be an occasion
for the G8 to take stock of the situation.

Subject: FW: Garcia Linera on Haiti
Rough translation of the points below:
O Evo Morales announced today that his government will ask for an emergency meeting at the UN to "reject the
U.S. military occupation" in Haiti, according to Spanish news agency EFE.
O "It is not possible that the U.S. is using a natural disaster to invade and occupy Haiti," said Morales, who
qualified as "inhumane, savage, and opportunist" the deployment of troops in the Caribbean island.
O "We'll ask the UN, via our Foreign Ministry, for an emergency meeting to reject this military occupation of the
U.S. in Haiti," announced Morales.
O Morales recalled that President Obama has guaranteed in international fora that he wants partners and
respectful diplomatic relations with other countries. "You don't achieve this (partners, diplomatic relations)
with military occupation, or troops, or bases," he said and expects "a pronouncement by the peoples of the
world and social forces rejecting this intervention and military occupation in Haiti."
O Morales also asked "how much money, food and water" will be destined to the 12,000 soldiers the U.S. sent to
Haiti and noted that this money "should be spend on the victims."
O He trusted that the American people will reject "the abusive use" of their economic resources for what he
insisted on qualifying as "military intervention."
O "The times of empire have ended: these are times of the people."

EVO MORALES FIDE REUNION DE EMERGENCIA PARA REPUDIAR Y RECHAZAR A EEUU
EN HAITI, INFORMA EVE.
• Evo Morales anunciO hoy que su Gobierno pedira. a Naciones Unidas una reuniOn de emergencia para
"repudiar y rechazar la ocupacion militar de Estados Unidos" en Haiti, informa la agencia espaiiola EFE.
• "No es posible que Estados Unidos use una desgracia natural para invadir y ocupar militarmente Haiti", dijo
Morales, quien califico de "inhumano, salvaje y oportunista" el despliegue de las fuerzas armadas
estadounidenses en la isla caribeiia.
• "Vamos a pedir mediante la cancilleria a las Naciones Unidas una reunion de emergencia para repudiar y
rechazar esta ocupacion militar de Estados Unidos hacia Haiti", anuncio Morales.
• Morales recordo que el mandatario de Estados Unidos, Barack Obama, ha garantizado en foros
internacionales que desea tener socios y relaciones diplomaticas de respeto mutuo con el resto de paises.
"Ser socios o tener relaciones diplomaticas no se hace con ocupacion militar, ni con tropas militares, ni con
bases militares", dijo y espera "un pronunciamiento de todos los pueblos del mundo y de las fuerzas sociales
rechazando esta intervencion y ocupacion militar en Haiti".
• Morales se pregunto tambien "cuanta plata, cuantos alimentos o cuanta agua" se van a destinar para
abastecer a los 12.000 soldados que Estados Unidos ha mandado a Haiti y considero que ese dinero "deberia
gastarse en los damnificados" por el terremoto y no en los militares.
• Conflo en que el propio pueblo estadounidense rechace "el uso abusivo" de sus recursos econOmicos para lo
que insistio en calificar como "intervencion militar".
• "Los tiempos de imperio se terminan: son tiempos de pueblos", sentencio.

MEDIA NOTE
Joint Statement on the Upcoming Sudan National Elections
Following is the text of a joint statement by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas
Store, and United Kingdom Foreign Secretary David Miliband on the upcoming national elections in Sudan.
Begin Text:
National elections in Sudan this month will represent a major milestone in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement that
ended Sudan's twenty-two year civil war, and are an important opportunity for the people of Sudan to participate in the
political process.
We urge all parties in Sudan to work urgently to ensure that elections can proceed peacefully and credibly in April. We
are deeply concerned by reports of continued administrative and logistical challenges, as well as restrictions on political
freedoms. We call on the Government of Sudan, the National Elections Commission, and all political parties to engage in
further dialogue to resolve practical obstacles, procedural impediments, and address allegations of intimidation,
harassment, and safety concerns, and other legitimate concerns raised by various political parties. We continue to urge
the parties to improve conditions on the ground in Darfur and create a secure environment conducive to Darfuri
participation.
Irrespective of the outcome of elections, it is essential that work continues and is accelerated to meet remaining CPA
deadlines. Progress is needed urgently to complete border demarcation, to establish the commissions that will
supervise the referenda for the South and Abyei, to conduct popular consultations in Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan,
and to negotiate sustainable post-CPA arrangements in areas such as wealth-sharing, citizenship and assets, and
liabilities.
We reiterate our commitment to ensure that the referenda must happen on schedule and that their outcomes need to
be respected. It is time to redouble efforts to achieve these ends. We urge all parties in Sudan and all regional and
international partners to work together to achieve the peaceful future that the people of Sudan deserve.

SUBJECT: Proposed World Bank Loan for South African Coal-fired Power Plant
On April 8 the World Bank Board is expected to consider whether to approve a $3.75 billion
loan for a 4,800 megawatt (MW) coal-fired power plant in South Africa (the "Medupi
project"). The project, by South Africa's state-owned Eskom utility, is intended to address a
worsening power shortage. The loan is controversial due to the 26 million tons of CO2
emissions per year that the plant will emit when completed, making it one of the largest single
sources of carbon emissions in the world. South Africa has sought U.S. support for the project
from senior levels at the Department and our Ambassador in Pretoria.

FYI we are putting out the following statement.
STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON
Bombing of the Shrine of Syed Ali Hujviri in Lahore
I was shocked and saddened by yesterday's attack on one of Pakistan's most popular places of worship, the Shrine of
Syed All Hujviri (Data Ganjbakhsh) in Lahore, which claimed the lives of many innocent Pakistanis.
The extremists have shown that they respect neither human dignity nor the fundamental religious values of Pakistani
society. Violating the sanctity of this revered shrine is a particularly sinister attempt to destabilize Pakistan and to
intimidate its people. The attackers will not succeed, as the Pakistani public refuses to be cowed by such violence.
We condemn this brutal crime and reaffirm our commitment to support the Pakistani people in their efforts to defend
their democracy from the violent extremists who seek to destroy it. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of
the victims and with all the people of Pakistan.

Subject: E3+Ashton
Steve Mull is proposing that you do a conference call with the E3 FMs and Ashton sometime this week. Here is the
rationale and background:
The European Union Foreign Affairs Council, comprised of all 27 EU Foreign Ministers, will next meet on May 10. In a
conversation April 26, Bill Burns persuaded the E3 and European Commission to support adding to the agenda of that
meeting a discussion of preparations for the sanctions the EU will impose following passage of a UNSCR.
The European Council, comprised of the EU's heads of government, will meet on June 16-17 — a meeting which could
direct the imposition of such sanctions if we succeed in passing an UNSCR by then.
The purpose of your teleconference would be to hear from the E3 and Ashton a status report on the EU's preparations
to impose such sanctions, and to discuss how the U.S. could best support the EU's forward progress. It would
supplement experts' level consultations we have been conducting for several weeks, including meetings on May 3 and
May 6.
The measures the Europeans are considering include bans on new Iranian bank branches in the EU, correspondent
banking relationships, new investment in the Iranian energy sector, and on access for Iranian ships to European ports.

your level is the only way to get it done.
Thanks so much in advance for looking into this. I know it is a busy month for you. You are just the best!!!

In full appreciation of Hilary's always-hectic life....and particularly her

her to simply show her below a letter I wrote this week to hopeuflly be
delivered to Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, dem out

intto Cuba.
The basics for Hilary to know are that CNN is covering the entire summer's
event I'm doing live.
24-hour training swim off Key West next week-end.
The Cuba Swim early August, weather dictating.
It's not that I've been flat turned down by the State Dept. But I have been
told I won't be approved this summer warm water, my training, all of
it....there's no other time I can or will do it.
It's going to be a terribly upbeat story to follow (in CLEAN ocean just
nearby the oil spill), it's going to be an embraced strong message to
redefine middle age as strong and relevant, to see a 60-year old
swim 103 miles and walk up onto the shores of her own country.
I have been told by lawyers within Treasury that it will take either
Hilary Clinton or Obama himself to clear my event.
I know somebody has the power to green light in an hour's time, if
I can just get to the right person.
. Please know that I wouldn't
interrupt either your or Hilary's precious holiday week-end if
I hadn't committed a year of hardship training to this and now involved
many good people in the adventure.
I just can't let this dream slip away because I can't get into Cuba
with State Dept approval.
Here is the Schultz doc below. And next I'm going to send you a
link to a short promo video.
Thanks so very, very much,

DIANA NYAD CUBA SWIM
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
At the end of July, 2010, just a month from now, I will attempt to become the first person in history to swim the
103 miles from Cuba to Florida without the aid of a shark cage.
In 1978, I swam out of Havana into a raging sea. 41hrs, 49mins later, it was not to be.
I'm 60 now. This time, when I do walk up onto the Florida shore, I will send a loud message to all the millions my
age that 60 is not irrelevant, that we are still strong, vital, vibrant individuals, that our best days are not by any means all
behind us.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769467 Date: 08/31/2015
For 30 years, I hadn't swum a stroke. I valued physical fitness to an extreme degree, but just hadn't swum at all
for 30 years. And now this past year's training is done. It has been intense. Many, many 10, 12, 15 hour swims in the
Caribbean. Grueling tests of both body and spirit.
But I was naive to think the training would be the tough part. I am feeling strong and confident. But the
government permissions for me to walk off the Cuban shore are keeping me from my Dream.
I first went to the Cuban Interest Section and was told the Cubans would eagerly welcome my event. They
remember my first attempt and I have been back many times for clinics and such. But they said I would definitely need
to first have approval from the State Department. I was told there that it is a sensitive time politically, that both Obama
and Hilary Clinton are very much pro-embargo and it would take perhaps a year to procure State Department clearance.
On advice from three lawyers from Sonnenschein in D.C., I was told that it would take a direct green light from
Hilary herself to get this expedition cleared.
Because I have been stymied by Treasury and the State Dept, I let the Cuban Interest Section permissions go so
now I don't have permissions from their end, either.
I am going to make one last attempt to get this done legally by contacting Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman
Schultz. Perhaps in light of a positive story vis a vis Florida Tourism....there is beautifully clean water, not far from the oil
disaster and the heroic message of a 60-year-old swimming 100 miles and walking up onto the shores of her own
country, her own home state, Congresswoman Schultz could champion the project into full legal status, from both the
Cuban and the State Department sides.
CNN is the exclusive broadcast coverer of my swim. I am just tonight on the front page of CNN.com.
There will no doubt be much positive news to come from this story...and to Florida....throughout my endeavor.
I will do a 24-hour training swim off Key West the week-end of July 10-11. CNN will cover live.
And then the hope is to go over to Havana on July 23 (or wait at a training camp in Key West starting on July 23)
and then get the Cuba swim started whenever Mother Nature gives us a forecast of calm seas.

Subject: Fw: Read-out: Ambassador Eikenberry's phone call with HAC-FO Chairwoman Nita Lowey
FYI for you and HRC
Ambassador Eikenberry and Chairwoman Lowey had a positive conversation that lasted more than an hour. He thanked
the Chairwoman for her leadership and support and for her willingness and commitment to work with her colleagues to
secure the significant amounts of funding that is so essential to the success of our Mission's programs and efforts. They
had a very candid and detailed conversation about the elements, causes, and contributors to corruption in Afghanistan
and the various interagency programs that are partnering with Afghan institutions to promote transparency and
investigate corrupt practices and prosecute corrupt actors.
Chairwoman Lowey appreciated Ambassador Eikenberry's detailed analysis and thorough review of the conditions in
Afghanistan. She stated that there is an absolute need to ensure meaningful and effective accountability of US taxpayer
funds appropriated by Congress. She conceded that we are not going to create an utopian society free of corruption,
but stressed the need for accountability and transparency. She was particularly concerned with various reports that
officials within the GIRoA are impeding the Embassy's efforts to assist the Afghans in investigating and prosecuting
corrupt actors. The Chair asked if there are enough credible partners in the Afghan government who are committed to
good governance and transparency. Ambassador Eikenberry provided an assessment of where he thought the
challenges are, the next steps to be taken, and how progress can be made going forward.
The Chair reiterated her longstanding support for assistance programs, especially education and health, and she asked
Ambassador Eikenberry if he felt we are making progress in the areas of health, education, and agriculture. He provided
a review of the various health, education, and agriculture programs and the multitude of changes that have been
implemented to ensure greater transparency, accountability, and flexibility of funds and how these changes have better
equipped the embassy to hold contractors accountable.
The Ambassador raised the certification of Ministries program; how we are seeking to certify additional ministries once
the Ministries achieve the appropriate level of financial accountability standards; and how these efforts will help
develop Afghan capacity and ultimately allow us to increase the amount of assistance that goes through the Afghan
government. They discussed the NSP program, and the Chair reiterated her support for the program and how she had
consistently increased funding for NSP.
Ambassador Eikenberry explained the Afghan public's reaction to reports that the assistance money had been removed
and he respectfully encouraged her to reinstate the funding as quickly as possible so as to send a clear message to
Afghans that we intend to have an enduring civilian assistance presence. He invited her to visit Afghanistan for several
days and travel the country to see first-hand the progress that has been made and the challenges and opportunities that
remain. She thanked him for his invitation and suggested that any visit might have to be deferred until November.

Several times she asked how the hearings could be helpful or if the hearings could be useful to shine a spotlight on
particular areas, and she welcomed Ambassador Eikenberry's thoughts on that issue. Ambassador Eikenberry agreed to
give that idea some additional consideration and to speak with the Chair on Tuesday morning.

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON
15th Anniversary of Srebrenica Genocide
Today we remember the tragic events in Srebrenica fifteen years ago. I join President Obama and the people of the
United States in offering our deepest condolences on this most solemn occasion. We honor the memories of the victims
and mourn with their families.
The United States stands with Bosnia and Herzegovina, and all countries in the region who wish to foster peace and
reconciliation. We remain committed to ensuring that those responsible for these crimes face justice. We recognize that
there can be no lasting peace without justice. It is only by bringing all responsible parties to account for their crimes that
we will truly honor Srebrenica's victims.
We are duty-bound — to the victims, to their surviving family members, and to future generations — to prevent such
atrocities from happening again. Our common faith in the value of freedom and peace unifies us and drives us to act.
That is why we are committed to working with all the communities that make up Bosnia and Herzegovina to move
forward and build a pluralistic, democratic state that can take its rightful place in the Euro-Atlantic community. A
prosperous, free, and unified Bosnia and Herzegovina is the most worthy monument to those who lost their lives at
Srebrenica and the best guarantee against such a tragedy ever repeating itself.

USIBC Launches New Education Initiative to Strengthen K-12, Vocational, and Higher Education Linkages in the U.S. and
India
June 2, 2010 - Washington, DC - On the occasion of its 35th anniversary, and looking ahead to the global economy of
the future, the U.S.-India Business Council (USIBC) today announced the launch of a new initiative aimed at
strengthening institutional linkages between academia, industry and NGOs focusing on the elementary, vocational and
higher education sectors in both countries.
"The United States and India must be committed partners in building the workforce of tomorrow, a partnership that will
unleash opportunity, spur growth and sustain prosperity not just in our countries but across the global community," said
Harold McGraw III, incoming USIBC Chairman and Chairman, President and CEO of The McGraw-Hill Companies. "To do
this, we must focus on strengthening our educational ties at every level. By working together our two countries can
equip the next generation with the education and skills necessary to compete and win in the global economy."
Mr. McGraw gave the keynote address before a packed audience of over 400 U.S. and Indian business, government, and
education leaders at USIBC's 35th Anniversary Summit, entitled "A Pivotal Period in U.S.-India Relations: Tackling
Education, Infrastructure and Inclusive Growth."
On the eve of the first-ever U.S.-India Strategic Dialogue, India's Union Minister of External Affairs, SM Krishna, U.S.
Education Secretary Arne Duncan, India's Minister of Human Resource Development, Kapil Sibal, and India's Ambassador
to the United States, Meera Shankar, joined hundreds of top business leaders in Washington to participate in the U.S.-
India Business Council 35th anniversary deliberations.
USIBC's Education Initiative will serve as a dynamic platform for business, NGOs, and academia to provide vital input into
both the U.S. and Indian governments - such that the synergies between American and Indian business and educational
communities are unleashed.
"We can talk about strategic, defense, civil nuclear, renewable energy and every other type of commercial cooperation,
but if we do not develop the skill sets in our respective societies to sustain such collaboration, all this talk will never be
successfully converted to action," Ron Somers, President of the U.S.-India Business Council, noted. "How fortunate it is
that families across all walks of life in both our societies so highly value education. We have much to learn from one
another, and much to accomplish - to prepare for the challenges of the 21st Century," Somers said.
The USIBC Education initiative will focus on three thrust areas:
1. Higher Education: USIBC will host the U.S.-India Higher Education Forum (HEF) at the invitation of the U.S. and
Indian governments. The HEF will serve as the premier platform to enlist academia, industry and NGOs to strengthen
linkages between U.S. and Indian educational institutions from both countries. The HEF will provide a formalized
network for industry, academia and the NGO community to provide direct policy input to the U.S. and Indian
governments in all areas of education, with an aim to facilitate greater collaboration, including the opening of India's
higher education sector.

2. Elementary K-12 Education : USIBC has embarked on a survey of rural and urban, private and public K-12 schools
throughout India to identify best practices that are working well in educating students, while assessing needs where
industry, NGOs and government may join together to fill gaps. With the support of Ryan International Group, one of
India's leading educators, both financial and intellectual resources will be mobilized to transform these and other
schools in a manner that promotes replication of successful models across India.
3. Vocational Training and Skills Development : USIBC will partner with its member-companies to feature Case
Studies of Vocational Training and Skills Development that are being implemented across India. The exercise will
attempt to enlist more corporations to participate in this important area of human capacity building. Programs helping
to train thousands of workers will generate employment opportunities and sustain economic growth now and for the
long future - in both countries.
India is embarked on expanding its community college system, including technical training institutions, as well as inviting
interest in implementing 30,000 new colleges and 1,500 universities over the next decade.
The United States continues to be the most sought after destination for Indian students studying overseas, attracting as
many as 113,000 each year to American universities and colleges. The U.S. wishes to remain a magnet for attracting the
best and the brightest from around the world by promoting institutional partnerships between U.S. based educational
institutions and new counterparts. Integral to this core knowledge infrastructure, industry must be involved in this
enterprise.
The McGraw-Hill Companies (NYSE: MHP) is a global information and education company providing knowledge, insights
and analysis in the financial, education and business information sectors through leading brands including Standard &
Poor's, McGraw-Hill Education, J.D. Power and Associates and Platts. McGraw-Hill established business operations in

Biden: Israel right to stop Gaza flotilla
from breaking blockade
VP Biden tells Charlie Rose that the Israel Navy
might not have needed to drop commandos onto the
Gaza-bound ship, but insists that Israel is entitled to
defend its security.
By Natasha Mozgovaya Tags: Joe Biden Gaza flotilla
U.S. Vice President Joe Biden on Wednesday defended Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip and its decision
to intercept the pro-Palestinian flotilla bringing humanitarian aid to the coastal territory, though he did not
go so far as to defend the Israel Navy raid that killed nine people two days earlier.
In an interview with Charlie Rose, Biden pointed out that Israel had given pro-Palestinian activists the
option of unloading their cargo at the Ashdod port, and offered to bring it to the Gaza Strip on their
behalf.
"They've said, 'Here you go. You're in the Mediterranean. This ship -- if you divert slightly north you can
unload it and we'll get the stuff into Gaza,", he said. "So what's the big deal here? What's the big deal of
insisting it go straight to Gaza? Well, it's legitimate for Israel to say, 'I don't know what's on that ship.
These guys are dropping... 3,000 rockets on my people.
"Look, you can argue whether Israel should have dropped people onto that ship or not -- but the truth of
the matter is, Israel has a right to know -- they're at war with Hamas -- has a right to know whether or
not arms are being smuggled in."
During the interview, Biden also blamed Hamas for the crisis that has wracked the coastal territory and for
the ongoing state of conflict with Israel.

"As we put pressure, and the world put pressure on Israel to let material go into Gaza to help those
people who are suffering, the ordinary Palestinians there, what happened? Hamas would confiscate it, put
it in a warehouse [and] sell it.
"So the problem is this would end tomorrow if llamas agreed to form a government with the Palestinian
Authority on the conditions the international community has set up," Biden told Rose.

From Landler today, middle of the piece -- not too much to it:
Israel also took issue with the Obama administration's assertion that the United States had warned Israeli
officials to exercise caution and restraint in intercepting the flotilla.
"I was not contacted by anyone in the administration about this," said Michael B. Oren, Israel's ambassador to
the United States. Mr. Oren said he was not aware that anybody else in the Israeli government had been called
and was seeking clarification from the administration.
A spokesman for the State Department, Philip J. Crowley, said the United States had "extensive contacts" with
Israel and Turkey before the flotilla set sail. "We expressed to the Israelis the need for caution and restraint in
dealing with civilians, including American citizens," he said.

MESEBERG, Germany – Germany and Russia declared Saturday that the five world powers negotiating with Iran support
a fresh set of international sanctions, and Chancellor Angela Merkel said they could pass soon.
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said at a news conference with Merkel that "agreement on the sanctions exists,"
despite the fact that "nobody wants sanctions."
"We hope the voice of the international community will be heard by the Iranian leadership," Medvedev said through the
official German translator.
Merkel said sanctions could be passed by the United Nations Security Council "in the near future."

"I am very happy, that we can stand here jointly today and say that this is a joint position not only of the European
Union, the United States of America and Russia, but also of China," Merkel said. "That is an important step the
international community has made here."
Moscow has recently joined the other four U.N. Security Council members — the United States, China, Britain and
France — to tentatively back a draft fourth set of U.N. sanctions against Iran.

"We have always taken a two-way approach, making offers, on the one hand, but, as there are no qualitative changes,
on the other hand now the time has come that such sanctions must be adopted," Merkel said.
Medvedev said it is unacceptable "that one continues to act irresponsibly. One has to move toward the partners of the
international community and it is only in this way that complicated issues can be solved."
Russia's president arrived Friday for a two-day visit to Germany to discuss a range of issues with Merkel.
The West is against an expansion of nuclear nations and suspects Iran is enriching uranium to build a nuclear warhead.
Tehran denies this and insists on its right to a peaceful nuclear power program, but has frustrated the West over its
failure to prove it.

JOINT STATEMENT
BY THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
CALLING ON THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT
TO FULFIL ITS HUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS
The United States and the European Union condemn the continuing human rights violations in Iran since the June
12 election. The large scale detentions and mass trials, the threatened execution of protestors, the intimidation of
family members of those detained and the continuing denial to its citizens of the right to peaceful expressiIon are
contrary to human rights norms.
Our concerns are based on our commitment to universal respect for human rights. We are particularly concerned
by the potential for further violence and repression during the coming days, especially around the anniversary of
the Islamic Republic's founding on 11 February. We call on the Government of Iran to live up to its international
human rights obligations, to end its abuses against its own people, to hold accountable those who have committed
the abuses and to release those who are exercising their rights.

Just saw the email from Sid - was working on the below report. Shaun apparently had a much
more pessimistic view of what Cameron would do than all of our Parliament watchers, who felt
confident from the get-go that he would support the deal.
PM Brown praised all parties involved; stressed the need to adhere to the dates laid out in
the agreement several times; welcomed the supportive Westminster interventions during the Q
and A of SDLP Mark Durkan and DUP Peter Robinson and Nigel Dods, but pointedly expressed hope
that other parties (read UUP, whose MP was either not present or simply didn't speak) would
express their support as soon as possible.
As expected, David Cameron praised the agreement and all parties; raised the desire that all
parties (read SDLP and UUP) be given time to review the document; and pointedly asked the PM
what issues that were not expressly mentioned in the agreement would be addressed by the
Working Group -- to which Brown responded, "all the issues outstanding from St Andrew's."
Cameron and Brown praised the U.S. role, singling you out. Brown also twice referred to your
offer to host an investment conference.
Overall, nothing concerning from the Tories...on the contrary, full support, a request that
the minority parties have a chance to review and some questions on outstanding issues.
UUP MLAs meet tonight to review.
Note: DUP interventions were balanced.. .Dods raised parades and decommissioning as reminder
of outstanding issues, but stressed desire of all parties "not to go back" to the bad old
days. Minor dig at previous Sinn Fein "threats." Robinson stressed cooperation in the
negotiations. Struck a statesmanlike tone.

Dear Cheryl —
In my last email (Friday, 5/28), I attached the letter from the bipartisan Co-Chairs and Executive Committee members of
the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission sent to Assistant Secretary Mike Posner expressing grave concern about the
recent rise in death threats, attacks and murders of Colombian human rights defenders, religious, community and other
NGO leaders. Congressman McGovern also strongly encouraged the Secretary to meet with representatives of those
organizations and individuals being threatened, with a particularly effort to reach out to and invite the Bishops of
Tumaco (Naritio), Barrancabermeja/Medio Magdalena (Santander), and we would now add Putumayo, since the
Colombian Catholic Church just advised us yesterday of increased death threats against religious workers there. In
addition, we recommended inviting Monserior Hector Fabio Henao, director of Pastoral Social, at the Archdiocese in
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769736 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769736 Date: 08/31/2015
Bogota, who represents all the pastoral work of the Church throughout the country, as well as representatives from the
Mennonite and Lutheran churches, in particular.
While in Colombia, the most important thing the Secretary can do is avoid effusive praise for President Alvaro Uribe,
who leaves office in August. Inside Colombia, the visit by the Secretary is being described as focusing solely on the free
trade agreement and continuing support of the counterdrug strategy/Plan Colombia. Without changes in the human
rights situation and the culture of impunity, it is unlikely that anything the Secretary might say or do will alter the
equation on Capitol Hill regarding the trade agreement. It should be noted that the October 2008 GAO report on the
counter-drug operations in Colombia concluded that U.S. assistance was successful in increasing security in parts of the
country, but a failure in the areas of counter-narcotics (GAO-09-71) , and a subsequent April 2009 USAID evaluation on
U.S. aid for Plan Colombia for illegal crop reduction and Colombian counternarcotics policies actually contribute to
increased coca production.
The Colombian president has been a solid backer of U.S. policy and U.S. interests in the region, and has achieved some
important improvements in the country's security situation. It is important to recognize that, but to do so without
repeating the tone of Defense Secretary Gates' April visit, in which he called Uribe a "great hero"
<http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=58754> and failed even to mention any concerns.
These concerns are of critical importance, and while the Secretary need not list them all, at least some deserve public
acknowledgement — some recognition that it is important to the United States that Colombia, including the current
government and its successor, show the necessary political will to deal with them:
• A sharp rise in alleged military killings of civilians. In many cases, these are so-called "false positives": non-
combatants murdered and later presented as members of armed groups killed in combat. These, notes
<http://www.extrajudicialexecutions.org/colombia> UN Special Rapporter for Extrajudicial Executions Philip Alston,
"began occurring with a disturbing frequency across Colombia from 2004." Citing prosecutors' and NGOs' reports, Alston
indicates that Colombia's security forces may have killed 1,486 civilians during the first six years of Alvaro Uribe's
presidency. Alston notes that the Defense Ministry only began to address the situation after the media broke the story
of the false-positives and the subsequent negative publicity and horrified public outcry.
The prosecution of "false positives" is moving with excruciating slowness. In perhaps the most notorious case — the
murders of about twenty young men from the poor Bogota suburb of Soacha — nearly all of the accused soldiers and
officers have been released from prison <http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=49968>, pending trial, as
deadlines for timely prosecution have run out. Since their arrest in late 2008, their case has been prolonged by
numerous delaying tactics by the defense, including attempts to have their cases tried in the military court system as
"acts of service." Alston reports that the impunity rate on these extrajudicial murders by security forces may be as high
as 98.5 percent.
Mounting allegations that the President's intelligence service, the DAS, was put at the service
<http://www.cipcol.org/?p=1123> of paramilitary leaders and narcotraffickers; used to spy on and intimidate
<http://www.cipcol.org/?p=752> Supreme Court justices, opposition politicians, journalists and human rights
defenders; and employed in a campaign of sabotage and smears <http://www.cipcoLorg/?p=1467> against political
opponents.
Prosecutors are alleging that the orders to have the DAS carry out wiretaps, surveillance and "political warfare" came
from high up in the Colombian presidency <http://www.caracoltv.com/noticias/justicia/articulo168592-tres-asesores-
de-uribe-son-investigados-chuzadas-ilegales> , though the question of "what President Uribe knew, and when he knew
it" remains unanswered. Meanwhile efforts to reform or dissolve the DAS are stalled in Colombia's Congress.
President Uribe's political coalition has also been hit by a scandal known in Colombia as "para-politics." This
coalition has included dozens of political bosses from regions beyond the capital. Many are large landholders with ties to
narcotrafficking, the same local leaders who created and fostered the brutal pro-government paramilitary groups that
killed tens of thousands of non-combatants in the 1990s and early 2000s.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769736 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769736 Date: 08/31/2015
Evidence, much of it from former paramilitary leaders, has brought about 300 criminal investigations against legislators,
governors, mayors and other local officials, nearly all of them Alvaro Uribe's political supporters, who made common
cause with the far-right warlords. To date, of the 278 congresspeople and senators elected in 2006, 68
<http://www.nuevoarcoiris.org.co/sac/?q=node/64> are under official investigation, on trial, or convicted for
paramilitary ties. Those embroiled in parapolitics include the President's cousin, Mario Uribe; the brother of his former
foreign minister; and individuals whom the President had named to be Colombia's ambassadors to Chile, the Dominican
Republic, and Canada.
The Colombian prosecutors, investigators, witnesses and non-governmental organizations trying to uncover the truth
about these abuses are working under conditions of great personal risk. They, too, are heroes and would benefit greatly
from a public expression of concern about the cases they are investigating, and a reminder that their work is legitimate
and important to U.S. interests in Colombia.
At the same time, it is important to avoid appearing to endorse any candidate in the June 20 runoff elections. Between
the first and second rounds of a country's presidential election is a politically awkward time for a high-level official visit.
Though President Uribe's former defense minister, Juan Manuel Santos, is the overwhelming favorite given his margin of
success in the May 30th first round of balloting over former Bogota mayor Antanas Mockus, it is necessary at this stage
to convey a sense of balance and a willingness to work closely with whoever wins. As a result, any kind words for one
candidate should be balanced by praise for the other.
Finally, it would be helpful to remind the Colombian people that the United States supports a peaceful resolution of
Bogota's worsening differences with Venezuela. While President Chavez's behavior is a significant concern, it would be
most unhelpful to be perceived on this trip as fanning the flames of conflict with Colombia — or playing into the Chavez
rhetoric that the U.S. and Colombia have military aspirations in the region.
Hope this memo, along with last week's copy of the TLHRC letter to Assistant Secretary Posner, are helpful and useful
materials for the Secretary as she plans her trip.
Very best wishes —
On behalf of Cong. Jim McGovern

President Serzh Sargsyan sent a message to the President of the Republic of Turkey Abdullah Gul.
The message states,
"Excellency,
Passing through Turkish airspace, I send my greetings to you and the people of neighboring Turkey.
Our initiative, aimed at the normalization of the Armenian-Turkish relations, holds attention of the international community.
This is a historic moment, indeed, and it is recognized not only by us, but also by the global community. Efforts of the
countries engaged in the region, aimed at the improvement of bilateral relations, are indispensable. I am confident that it
wouldn't be possible to move forward without their support. At the same time, I believe no matter how interested friendly
states might be in a positive resolution of the impasse, there are certain things that can be done only by our two nations.
Mr. President,
I hope you will agree that the Armenian and Turkish peoples assign the main task of getting rid of the stereotypes
regarding each other and establishment of the atmosphere of mutual trust to their respective govemments. We can
achieve results only if there are trust, resolve, and unfaltering stance. A situation when words are not supported by deeds
gives rise to mistrust and skepticism, providing ample opportunities to counteract for those, who oppose the process. We
should be mindful of the fact that in this particular case, the time is working not for but against the process.
If until now we have been able to bring our bilateral relations up to a level which made the prospects of building normal
relations between our two countries more tangible and discernible, now the time has come to manifest determination to
make next major step and leave to the coming generations a stable and secure region.
Please accept, Excellency, the assurances of my highest esteem."

2006, he said, "We are the only country, the only people, which remain still divided. Germany reunited its
nation; Romania remains still divided into two countries. But, I repeat, our reunification will occur inside of the
European Union and in no other way." In 2009, he said "Who can imagine that a head of Romanian state will

EU integration. He said "Romania recognized the state borders of the Republic of Moldova inherited from the
former Soviet Union. Romania agrees to sign an agreement in regards to the existent border regime, the way it
was inherited from the USSR." Romania and Moldova, in fact, have good relations and no real border issues;
the two governments are working on an agreement to make cross-border travel easier for Moldovans.
The biggest challenge to Moldova's territorial integrity is Transnistria, where de facto authorities rely on the
long-term presence of Russian forces for political support. Moldova's leaders seek a transition to a multilateral
presence and withdrawal of Russian troops, but this is not likely without a political settlement on Transnistria's
reintegration. Moldovan and Transnistrian authorities are pursuing quiet confidence building measures and

Update on Ukraine Election Situation
With over 99.9 percent of the vote in Ukraine counted, Yanukovych leads by 3.5 percent
(almost 900,000 votes) and is the clear winner and next president. The Central Election
Commission should complete its vote tabulation today and must certify the results within ten
days; certification is expected as early as Friday. Tymoshenko, who has been silent publicly,
plans to bring cases of alleged electoral fraud to the courts, but they will not change the
result. Tymoshenko claims that she intends to work within the law and not to incite street
protests.
Our recommendation is
EU Ambassadors in Kiev
have recommended the same approach to Brussels, but want to revisit it if there is no progress
by Friday. Medvedev called Yanukovych today with praise for the conduct of elections, but
stopped short of congratulating him on his victory.
Following certification of the election, Tymoshenko is likely to appeal within the legal five-day
period. This will likely push back an inauguration date until early March.

Hi Jake- You might let S know that the Turkey-Azerbaijan Agreement was signed today by the Ministers in the presence
of Aliyev and Erdogan. I spent last week in Baku. During the week I met for an hour and a half with Aliyev on the
agreement and a 45 minute one-on-one on our overall issues. I felt a bit like Dr. Phil. I told him what a big deal the FSN
issue was and how important it was to get resolved. I will forward on the high side an e-mail describing the meeting. This
was all fully coordinated with Phil Gordon. On the gas agreement, I am sending congratulatory letters to Aliyev and
Erdogan, both of whom I have worked with directly on these issues. If you think it a good idea for S to send letters, I can
send you drafts. Thanks...Dick

Brazilian FM defends dialogue with Iran
BRASILIA, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said Tuesday Brazil would maintain negotiations
with Iran on uranium enrichment and oppose any sanctions against Iran.
Amorim said Brazil was against the production of nuclear weapons, but Iran had the right to carry out a peaceful nuclear
program.
"Dialogue is still possible. What we want is to make sure (that the uranium will not be used to make weapons) through
peaceful ways and dialogue," Amorim told reporters.
Under a draft deal brokered by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN nuclear watchdog, most of Iran's
existing low-grade enriched uranium should be shipped to Russia and France, where it would be processed into fuel rods
with a purity of 20 percent.
Iran declared on Tuesday it had started the process of producing 20-percent enriched uranium inside the country.
In response to Iran's announcement, the U.S.-led Western countries have warned to take political and economic
sanctions against Iran.
For his part, Amorim said he considered any kind of sanctions ineffective and dangerous because they might cross a limit
and jeopardize peace.
Iran's president made an official visit to Brazil in November, during which the Brazilian government defended Iran's right
to have its own peaceful nuclear program including uranium enrichment similar to Brazil's, following international
standards.

The United States is determined to bring about a two-state solution. Believes there is a strong basis for doing
so. Believes it can be done by combining a renewed political negotiation with change on the ground, bottom up, as set
out in Prime Minister Fayyad's plan for a Palestinian state.
To this end,,Tony Blair, as Quartet Representative, will work in partnership with Senator Mitchell to support the political
negotiation by mobilizing the efforts of the international community: (1) to build support for the institutional capacity
and future governance of a future Palestinian state; (2) to improve freedom of movement and access for Palestinians;
(3) to encourage further private sector investment; and (4) to bring change in the living conditions of the people in Gaza.

An FT interview with Hillary Clinton
By Daniel Dombey
FT
June 11 2010 22:21
This is what it is like to be Hillary Clinton. The motorcade, twisting and skidding through rain-splashed
streets for more than an hour; the public meetings and camera lights at journey's end; the spotlight that
has not let up for two decades. It is almost as if the 2008 US presidential election — hailed as the most
exciting for a generation — had never ended.
But this is a campaign without a vote. Today, Clinton's convoy is snaking through Sao Paulo, Brazil, not
South Hampton, New Hampshire. She herself is no longer an aspirant for the White House, despite what
the overnight flights, town hall meetings and strategy sessions that make up her gruelling schedule might
suggest. Instead, she is in Latin America to shore up relations with the region and promote a new idea of
US leadership, one very much built around herself.
She's had bigger and more ecstatic audiences than the 700-odd students and staff crammed into the hall
tonight at Zumbi dos Pradares, an Afro-Brazilian university, but she's still greeted by a wave of raised
arms as the audience snaps away at her with their mobile phones.
In the convoy moments before, she was wrapped in a shawl, suffering from a cold and angry at the delays
that pushed us into the side streets speckled with box-like bars, warehouses and love hotels while
Brazilian motorists sought to cut into our path. There is no sign of that now. With the metabolism of a
born politician, she feeds off the energy of her audience and takes questions from students, teachers and
local celebrities for an hour. Hillary Clinton never looks happier than when she is centre stage.
Most US secretaries of state wouldn't bother with this sort of event, much less initiate it and arrange for it
to be screened on the biggest local channel. Yet this is what Clinton does on almost every foreign trip —
and she seems to spend half her life on her official 727, crammed with long-time aides and armed

quarter of a million miles since taking office.
On this Latin America trip, thrown into confusion by an earthquake in Chile, we have already visited four
countries in 24 hours. We go to tiny Uruguay, where our stay is so brief we check into a hotel just for a
shower; Argentina, where we spend almost all our time at the presidential palace; Chile itself, where we
don't leave the airport; and Brazil, where we spend almost a full day.
So what exactly is Clinton trying to do on this never-ending world tour? Travelling with her for a week,
talking to people inside and outside the administration, I tried to find out.
"We now have a case to make and it is not just a case that is made to the president or the prime minister
or the foreign minister or an ambassador," she tells me a few weeks later, as she perches on a sofa in her
expansive office, with its view of the Lincoln Memorial. "People now have a voice and an opinion and a
vote in many instances on the direction that their own societies take ... I want to model a different kind of
leadership that is open and willing to listen but [also] to stand our ground if necessary."
She argues that these trips of hers help to restore the US's image in the wake of the Bush administration
- by making contact with public opinion abroad, and so boosting American power. Her aides say that, as a
battle-hardened politician who also happens to be one of the most famous women in the world, she is
ideally placed to carry out the task. But the deeper question is whether she is merely implementing the
foreign policy crafted by Barack Obama, her boss and former rival, or whether her role - and ambitions -
go beyond that.
Is she a kind of saleswoman-in-chief for the US, I ask? "Well, I think that is part of the job," she replies,
toying with the napkin underneath her glass of water. "If you are making a case for American values and
for American leadership, you have to make it where people now get information ... Given the bridges we
had to build and some of the repair work we had to do, we had to travel."
As in Sao Paulo, her system is under strain - "I've been fighting this all day," she says as she masks a
cough set off by her allergies (Washington's cherry blossom trees are shedding their flowers). Life is still
hectic - the volcanic ash cloud has just all but paralysed Europe and televisions throughout the State
Department are showing the first British election debate. But Clinton remains enthusiastic, affable and
unhurried, her speech peppered with exclamations such as "oh my gosh", even as she discusses issues of
state. She politely asks if I have any updates for her about Europe's airspace shutdown and tells me she's
been talking to Norway's foreign minister about it.
"He said that this dust gets into engines of any size, even Air Force One - it's chunky! I don't know how
else to describe it," she says, an odd note of hilarity entering her voice as she pronounces the word
"chunky".
Clinton often speaks in this eager, unvarnished way - a world away from the clipped, on-message manner
of her immediate predecessor in the post, Condoleezza Rice. If anything, she is an undiplomat - known
less for calibrated circumlocutions than for her plain speaking and sometimes her gaffes, a woman who
retains both a formidable political constituency and a laugh she once admitted can send cats scurrying
from a room.
Her staff point out she is only the third elected politician in 60 years to have served as secretary of state,
and the first to come from outside the foreign policy establishment since James Baker, George H.W.
Bush's right-hand man and perhaps her most illustrious recent predecessor. She may be the most
substantive politician in the office since William Jennings Bryan, the three-time presidential candidate who
served as secretary almost a century ago. "Her stature on the world stage, her almost presidential
stature, has set her apart," Bill Burns, the top career diplomat at the State Department, tells me. "Leaders
want to meet her. And the town hall meetings do make a difference with public opinion."

State visitor Hillary Clinton is greeted by Air Force Base Commander Colonel Celso de Araujo at Sao Paulo
airport in March
Back in Sao Paulo, the meeting at the university ranges far from the confines and dramatis personae of
traditional diplomacy. Annie, a young woman with red and blue dreadlocked hair, tells Clinton about her
dance and percussion classes and asks how to study in the US without paying college fees. A nervous
young man confesses himself lost halfway through an abstruse question about tariff policy; Clinton,
smiling and nodding in that vaguely automatic way of hers, bears with him all the same. Another female
student asks for an autograph. When answering, Clinton sometimes opens her eyes wide as she
emphasises a phrase; at other moments, seemingly at random, she pulls her hands apart as if
demonstrating the size of a fish.
Then a law student called Marina asks about abortion - which is illegal in Brazil - and Clinton moves into
treacherous terrain. She speaks of the Brazilian hospital she visited in the 1990s that treated not just
expectant mothers but women suffering from the consequences of backstreet abortions. "Wealthy women
have rights in every country," she says. "And poor women don't." Her strength of feeling can't be hidden
as she denounces "the great toll that illegal abortions take and the denial of women being able to exercise
such a fundamental personal right".
Tom Shannon, the US ambassador to Brazil, tells me later: "I understand the possible concern that we
might have come close to domestic issues. But she wasn't laying out a prescription for Brazil. She was
sharing her experience as a woman in American politics and as secretary of state." It's true: Clinton
doesn't quite cross the line. Onstage, she is controlled without seeming artificial, convivial without
appearing over-effusive, what a previous age would call a real trouper. At the podium she looks straight
ahead, her lips carefully expressionless. Still, the old competitive instincts haven't left her. Perhaps it is
the lecterns at press conferences, reminiscent of the Democratic presidential debates, but on exiting the
podium at a joint appearance with Argentina's president Cristina Fernandez, Clinton makes clear her
satisfaction at having had the last word. The expert debater who usually bested Obama has not left the
stage.
Yet that competitive urge coexists with what one insider describes as her "almost inhuman loyalty"
towards Obama. Her mastery of the facts - an "information carnivore" one of her officials calls her -
comes despite the consensus in much of Washington that her role consists largely of implementing the
foreign policy Obama and his inner circle have framed, rather than helping frame it herself.
In Sao Paulo, she shows her loyalty in striking fashion when she is asked repeatedly about positive
discrimination - another sensitive topic in Brazil - not least because, Clinton herself observes, Afro-
Brazilians account for more than half the country's population but only 2 per cent of university students.
"That suggests to me that some special steps need to be taken [in] recruiting and admitting students so
that they can have a chance to succeed," she tells the hall, again inching towards domestic politics, before
speaking of her pride in the progress the US civil rights movement has made in the past half-century. She
says: "The election of Barack Obama, many believe, was the greatest accomplishment of all because it
demonstrated that an African-American could be elected president of the United States."
Among the crowd, I catch my breath and scribble down her words. It's hard to think of a more fulsome
statement from the woman who fought so hard against Obama - and who squandered a huge poll lead
and millions of dollars in the struggle against him.
The great collaborator Clinton has established strong working relationships within the Obama
administration
When I ask Clinton later about how she managed to move from the antagonism of the primary race to the
obedience of office, she dismisses my question with an anodyne "that's politics". She adds: "We're
working really hard and well together ... It just never comes up any more, it seems like ancient history to
me." Not so ancient, I think, that she is willing to admit the failings of her campaign. "I always run
inclusive and successful organisations," she retorts when I ask her whether she'd applied any lessons from
that searing experience to her new post.
She admits she didn't want the job at State - she says she was exhausted by the election and missed the

Senate - "but at the end of the day, I'm pretty old-fashioned and if the president asks you to do
something, you'd better have a really good reason why you can't." Also, she adds: "Suppose I had won
and I were asking him to be in my cabinet ... I would have wanted him to say yes."
Others say the relationship is more complex, that by dint of her loyalty and unflagging hard work, Clinton
has moved closer to the charmed circle and made herself an even more formidable political force than
before. "Quite simply, she gives good advice and the president over a year and a half has recognised
that," says Anne-Marie Slaughter, head of the State Department policy planning unit. "The relationship is
based on her performance in the job."
By all accounts, it's a collaborative partnership, though not perhaps a warm one. Clinton boasts a good
working relationship with the main players of the administration - and has formed something of an
alliance with defence secretary Robert Gates, although on life-and-death issues such as Afghanistan, it is
Gates, not her, who has taken the lead. As one official told me, secretaries of state have often either been
popular with their own department - Colin Powell comes to mind - or with the rest of the administration -
as was Condoleezza Rice - but Clinton has managed to be both.
In truth, Clinton's language remains harder-edged than Obama's - she recently claimed that Iran's
Revolutionary Guard had staged a slow-motion coup - and she has sometimes been more willing than he
is to hint at using the military. "She seems to step up with a bit of spine just at the right time," says Kurt
Volker, a US ambassador to Nato under George W. Bush.
She has also assumed an ever more prominent role in talking to leaders such as Benjamin Netanyahu of
Israel and Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan - apparently because she is trusted both by them and Obama.
Meanwhile, she has been careful to keep her husband, the former US president, in the background. Aides
say they have barely seen him in the building - though Clinton herself says that behind the scenes Bill
Clinton gives her strategic advice. "One of his favourite sayings, that I remind myself of all the time, is a
kind of baseball saying," she says: "Don't major in the minors; keep your eye on not just the headlines
but the trend lines."
It is her co-operative stance rather than any notable effort to set out a grand vision of her own that is the
chief theme of her time so far at State. When I ask Clinton to name her proudest achievement in office,
she replies "the effective and collaborative approach that this administration has taken towards identifying
and solving problems." A more process-oriented, less provocative answer would be hard to imagine.
But maybe, I think, the US has less scope for grand strategy than it did in the past couple of decades,
when the country seemed to bestride the world colossus-style. Clinton herself suggests that so formidable
are the tasks confronting the US that the administration has little scope to enter into internecine fights but
needs instead to focus on the challenges to hand. Whatever the reason for her stance, it seems to be a
smart decision - by all accounts she's overcome many of the suspicions the White House retinue had
towards her.
"It's fair to say that she was not born into the administration's inner circle but slowly but surely, for the
most consequential decisions, she now has a prime seat at the table," says one official. Praising what he
calls her "Terminator-quality durability and determination," he adds: "She's done an amazing amount of
work, judging that the way to build a strategic vision is bottom up, by mastering the details."
Indeed, Clinton's ability to master the most arcane foreign policy briefs is the marvel of her building. She
has dropped into obscure working groups and shown an unnerving knowledge of their details. At her
confirmation hearings last year she exchanged facts about the arctic with an Alaskan senator; at the
meeting in Sao Paulo she becomes enthused about freight transport policy both in Brazil and the US. She
herself acknowledges that finding her feet on foreign policy was something of a struggle, despite her
campaign claims of expertise in the field. "It was so intellectually challenging, just to get our arms around
all of these issues," she says. During her first year, she was criticised for apparent gaffes - including the
way she called for Israel to halt all building of settlements on occupied territory only to hail a partial freeze
a few months later as unprecedented. On an election campaign, she says, "you may be in a different city
four times a day but you have a message you're trying to deliver that is repetitive and aimed at your

audience. But here you might deal with 10 different countries' problems, six different regional or global
challenges in the course of a day."
As the Latin America tour shows, she is now trying to do both - travel incessantly and solve an array of
international issues. She is at the forefront of the US's efforts to consolidate relations with a number of
important countries - predominantly Russia and China, but also rising powers such as Brazil, Turkey,
Indonesia and South Africa - and to cool down anti-American feeling in hotspots, notably Pakistan. She
says the push is working, hailing a "change in public opinion in places that were pretty negative about the
US" - a reference to Russia and Pakistan. But it is far from smooth sailing. Differences about Iran and
over Israel's raid on aid-bearing ships off Gaza have stoked tensions with Turkey and Brazil recently, amid
questioning of the effectiveness of the Obama administration's policies.
During my time with her on the road, the stop in Brazil is the focal point - not surprising given the
country's increased profile as Latin America leader. Clinton is now heading the administration's push to
secure sanctions on Iran, and in Brasilia she tries and fails to win President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to her
cause. She employs an almost combative tone at a press conference with Celso Amorim, Brazil's foreign
minister. At moments she appears to barely contain her irritation, as she denounces "an Iran that runs to
Brazil" as well as other countries such as Turkey and China "telling different things to different people to
avoid international sanctions". Amorim is spiky in his own way - drawing parallels to the 1990s sanctions
on Iraq and the claims about weapons of mass destruction before the 2003 war. "Of course, I don't agree
with everything the Secretary said," he says.
It is not a happy experience - indeed this past week both Brazil and Turkey voted against sanctions at the
United Nations - yet Hillary Clinton is nowhere near giving up. Years ago, one of Bill Clinton's biographers
described his approach to government as a "permanent campaign", and it appears to be his wife's
preferred form of existence as well. If there is one constant in Clinton's life, it is that she never throws in
her cards, whether what motivates her is power or public service.
"Never, never!" she exclaims, when I ask whether she ever thought of walking off into the wings after the
frustrations and indignities of her time at the White House. "I have a very realistic sense of what high-
stakes politics requires and it took me a while to get there because it's shocking when you are in the
arena ... but once you figure it out, you can take it seriously for purposes of analysis and understanding,
but you can't take it personally." Such treatment seems to rankle all the same. She's been listening to
coverage ahead of the British debate and is plainly irritated by the coverage of the leaders' wives.
"Whether a woman's running for office or she's supporting her husband who's running for office and she
gets criticised for wearing open-toed shoes or for the colour of her coat, there's just a lot of history that
you bear if you are a woman who puts herself out in the political arena," she says.
Another country Clinton boards her official 727 to fly from Sao Paulo to Costa Rica
Injustice towards women appears to be the issue that most enthuses Clinton in this job - as in her many
other incarnations in American public life, whether as First Lady or before. "I feel passionately it is in not
just the American national security interests but the world's, that women be given the opportunities and
the tools to make the most out of their own lives," she says.
In the 1990s she steered clear of reading the newspapers because of the way she was treated. Today, she
says, "I certainly don't read coverage of me, I read what else is going on that I need to know about to do
my job." "It's all baloney," says Philippe Reines, her press adviser, who set up the meeting with her and is
sitting to one side in her office.
"Yeah, yeah, right, that's what he tells me," Clinton responds.
I wonder. She may not read the stories about her, but she has boosted her domestic profile still further by
talking to American magazines such as Esquire, Vogue and Parade. To what end? Clinton has said she will
only serve one four-year term as secretary of state - understandable, given the grind of the job. When I
ask whether she expects a woman president in the next decade or so, she responds: "I'd love that,
obviously I would love that. I want to be front and centre when it happens."

"Any chance it would be you?" I ask.
"No, no, I don't think that's in the cards," Clinton says. She's given more categoric denials in the past. "I
think that there's a whole generation of young women and not so young, but mature, seasoned women
who are earning their stripes and recognising how tough it is out there. It is not for the faint of heart to
run for president, and I believe it is harder for women, it just is, and that's just a fact." But, says one US
official, "all the profiles and all this media treatment undercut the argument that she is finished with
electoral politics. Why do all this stuff? She's already Hillary Clinton. You have to ask: 'What's the idea
behind raising her domestic profile still further?"
Indeed she is now, by some counts, the most popular politician in America and some in Washington say
she could be a good fit for the vice-presidential slot in the 2012 elections.
Back in Sao Paulo, once the town hall meeting is over, Clinton faces a seven-hour flight to Costa Rica. The
journey goes on and on, and as saleswoman-in-chief for the US in an unruly world, she faces a long, hard
road. Today the US sometimes struggles to assert itself on the world stage. But the obstacles are rather
fewer if the product she is pitching is herself. A secretary of state like none before her, Hillary Clinton,
long one of the most formidable figures in US politics, is looking stronger than ever.

David Miliband: "Hillary is a rock star ... she has a great sense of fun, and a great sense of humour"
It's too early to start chalking up a scorecard because Hillary Clinton, and the Obama administration, is
laying the foundations for long-term change in America's foreign policy. The challenges are immense -
probably more difficult than the inheritance of any previous administration. But American leadership is
essential and a commitment to multilateralism - in fact multi, multilateralism using different and
overlapping forums - is real and right.
You also have to remember that Hillary is a rock star. When I arrived at the Nato Foreign Ministers
meeting in March 2009, it was a nice surprise that all the staff, never mind the press, seemed to have
turned out in droves for my arrival. Then I realised that Hillary was 10 minutes behind me.
That said, the thing that most surprised me about working with Clinton was not her intelligence or her
hard work, all of which are well known, but that behind the serious exterior is someone who has a great
sense of fun, and a great sense of humour. She has seen politics from all sides, and can laugh at herself
as well as at others.
She's a remarkably good listener, always synthesising ideas and opinions to develop her own. She thinks
strategically as well as tactically. She's also very, very unpompous. Hillary is a very political person but in
a particular way, she honours politics and public service and believes that democratic politics is not a
necessary evil, but a calling of value and vocation. She knows you win some and you lose some, but it's
essential to take part.
There's one other thing. Hillary is a people person in that she thinks deeply about the psychology of the
people she's dealing with. Their motivation, their loyalties, their culture. It's real emotional intelligence in
trying to understand why people disagree and how you can get them to agree. I think that must be why
so many other members of the administration say she is a very good colleague.

Gideon Rachman: "Relations between the White House and the State Department are not particularly
close"

A school teacher asked to write a report on Hillary Clinton's stint as secretary of state would have to give
her 10/10 for effort but a rather more modest mark for actual achievements - maybe a six or a seven.
Secretaries of state are generally judged on two criteria. First, how have they done in the endless
bureaucratic turf wars that characterise Washington politics? Second, how effective have they been in
promoting US foreign policy in the wider world? Success in one area usually helps in the other. Henry
Kissinger was a superb Washington infighter - and his close relationship with President Nixon made him
all the more effective overseas. Colin Powell, George W. Bush's first secretary of state, was widely
admired outside the US - but came out on the wrong side of many of the Washington battles, which
limited his ability to get things done in the wider world.
Hillary Clinton has skilfully avoided being sucked into the debilitating Washington struggles that so
damaged Powell. Despite the often poisonous rivalry between the Obama and Clinton camps during the
campaign, Clinton has a good working relationship with the president. But while relations between the
White House and the State Department are cordial, they do not seem to be particularly close. Clinton
appointed many loyalists from her own campaign to the State Department, with the result that State is
rather detached from Obama's inner circle. Obama's penchant for making high-profile speeches in foreign
capitals such as Cairo, Prague, Tokyo and Istanbul means that the president himself has done more than
anyone else to define his administration's approach to the world.
That still leaves a role for Clinton to fill in the crucial details of policy. But special representatives have
been appointed to deal with Afghanistan and the Middle East - and the Treasury is critical to China policy.
Asked about Clinton's impact as secretary of state, one senior European policymaker purses his lips and
says: "She's done some great trips, and she's highly professional. But it's hard to see any particular area
where she has really driven policy."
Gideon Rachman is the FT's chief foreign affairs columnist
David Rothkopf: "When she has been asked to deliver tough messages, she has done so unflinchingly"
Hillary Clinton has been a cautious secretary of state: she has protected the president well and pursued
his agenda without upstaging him - an early concern, given her stature. She has worked very well with
other members of the cabinet, and is reconsidering the role and structure of the State Department.
That includes a review of the role of diplomacy going forward. Clinton has not only acknowledged the rise
of new powers and a changing global power structure but has taken steps to reshape US foreign policy
structure accordingly. An important part of that has been recognising the importance of co-operating with
private and non-state actors such as NG05, as well as dealing with non-state threats.
When the administration has called upon her to deliver tough messages, she has done so unflinchingly.
This has allowed the president to articulate a strategic vision which Clinton then goes about implementing.
Still, neither the secretary of state nor the president determines the global situation. The US may be the
most powerful country in the world but it is one among many powerful countries, and many aspects of the
situation we face today are beyond our control. The Obama administration has been dealt an extremely
difficult hand: not only Iraq and Afghanistan, but Iran and North Korea's nuclear programmes, the rise of
emerging powers and a complex and still unfolding series of financial crises.
We have gone from a world in which the US thought it had limitless resources and unbounded options to
one where the limits are clear; from a world in which you could work in the G8 to one where you have to
work in the context of the G20; a world where new technologies and new powers play a bigger role. All of
those things would dictate a change in foreign policy regardless of who is in office.
Hillary Clinton has established a very solid foundation. The next step is to identify a couple of signature
issues - and have a couple of signature successes. That will take her to the next level.

"Part of the problem is structural: The
Defense Department budget exceeds
$600 billion a year, while the State Department
receives only $50 billion. But
part of the problem is personal: In private,
Team McChrystal likes to talk shit
about many of Obama's top people on the
diplomatic side. One aide calls Jim Jones,
a retired four-star general and veteran
of the Cold War, a "clown" who remains
"stuck in 1985." Politicians like McCain
and Kerry, says another aide, "turn up,
have a meeting with Karzai, criticize him
at the airport press conference, then get
back for the Sunday talk shows. Frankly,
it's not very helpful." Only Hillary Clinton
receives good reviews from McChrystal's
inner circle. "Hillary had Stan's back during
the strategic review," says an adviser.
"She said, 'If Stan wants it, give him what
he needs.'
"McCluystal reserves special skepticism
for Holbrooke, the official in charge
of reintegrating the Taliban. "The Boss
says he's like a wounded animal," says a
member of the general's team. "Holbrooke
keeps hearing rumors that he's going to
get fired, so that makes him dangerous.
He's a brilliant guy, but he just comes in,
pulls on a lever, whatever he can grasp
onto. But this is COIN, and you can't just
have someone yanking on shit."
At one point on his trip to Paris, Mc-
Chrystal checks his BlackBerry. "Oh,
not another e-mail from Holbrooke," he
gams. "I don't even want to open it." He
clicks on the message and reads the salutation
out loud, then stuffs the BlacicBerry
back in his pocket, not bothering to conceal
his annoyance.

From John Beyerle ... Perhaps the Russians won't send troops:
I just called Karasin. He agreed that the situation had gotten worse in Osh and Jalalabad today but said the Russian
position is still that sending in foreign troops, whether Russian or CSTO, will be counterproductive and lead to more
violence and bloodshed.
The IL-76s that flew in to Kant today were the EMERCOM/M4C planes he told me about yesterday; they have
humanitarian cargo, primarily doctors and medical equipment. I cited the news reports that a battalion of paratroopers
had gone in -- he said there may be some troops on board to guard the plane or beef up security at Kant, but he was
firm that at this point Russia has no plans to introduce its own forces in the south. The main objective was to stop the
violence through peaceful means; Russia had provided the Kyrgyz forces with additional "technical means" for
accomplishing that. He said they hoped this would help Kyrgyz forces get control of the situation, which was their main
goal.
I asked about CSTO planning, and possible UN or OSCE PKFs. He said there is no formal CSTO meeting planned,
although people are consulting via phone. He repeated their hesitation to see any CSTO deployments. They have not
yet considered UN or OSCE PKFs, but if the situation continues to deteriorate, he wouldn't exclude the possibility.
Rushailo is currently in Moscow, but may be sent to Bishkek tomorrow or Tuesday. He agreed to call me if there is any
major change in the situation on the ground, or regarding force deployments. Tomorrow is a Russian holiday but he'll
have his cell phone on.

McC Statement:
I extend my sincerest apology for this profile. It was a mistake
reflecting poor judgment and should never have happened.
Throughout my career, I have lived by the principles of personal honor
and professional integrity. What is reflected in this article falls far
short of that standard.
I have enormous respect and admiration for President Obama and his
national security team, and for the civilian leaders and troops fighting
this war and I remain committed to ensuring its successful outcome.
Aides to U.S. general in Afghanistan slam Obama:
report
20 mins ago
WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Aides to the top U.S. general in Afghanistan insulted some of President Barack Obama's closest advisers,
calling one a "clown" and another a "wounded animal," in an article to be published Friday in Rolling Stone magazine.
The article also quotes an aide describing the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan General Stanley McChrystal's
"disappointment" with his initial one-on-one meeting with Obama last year.
Quoting all the McChrystal aides anonymously, the article portrays a split between the U.S. military and Obama's advisers at an
extremely sensitive moment for the Pentagon, which is fending off criticism of its strategy to turn around the nearly nine-year-old
Afghan war.
The Pentagon had no immediate comment about the article, which has been brought to the attention of senior officials.

It quotes a member of McChrystal's team making jokes about Vice President Joe Biden, who was seen as critical of the general's
efforts to escalate the conflict and who had favored a more limited counter-terrorism approach.
"Biden?" the aide was quoted as saying. "Did you say: Bite me?"
Another aide called White House National Security Adviser Jim Jones, a retired four star general, a "clown" who was "stuck in 1985."
It quoted an adviser to McChrystal dismissing an early meeting with Obama as a "10-minute photo op."
"Obama clearly didn't know anything about him, who he was. The boss was pretty disappointed," the adviser told the magazine.
McChrystal, a famous workaholic said to sleep just four hours a day, was brought into Afghanistan a year ago after his predecessor
was pushed out.
The article portrays his teams as disapproving of the Obama administration, with the exception of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,
who backed McCrystal's request for additional troops in Afghanistan.
Some of the strongest criticism was reserved for Richard Holbrooke, Obama's special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan.
"The boss says he's like a wounded animal," a member of the general's team is quoted as saying. "Holbrooke keeps hearing rumors
that he's going to get fired, so that makes him dangerous."
McChrystal was quoted as saying he felt "betrayed" by the leak of a classified cable from U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Karl
Eikenberry last year. The cable raised doubts about sending more troops to shore up an Afghan government already lacking in
credibility.
"I like Karl, I've known him for years, but they'd never said anything like that to us before," McChrystal was quoted as saying in the
article.
"Here's one that covers his flank for the history books. Now if we fail, they can say, 'I told you so."

McChrystal's Next Offensive?
Relations between the U.S. military and civilians in the Obama administration have been tense since last year's three-month review of Afghan war strategy, a state of affairs
unlikely to be helped by a new profile of Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the overall commander in Afghanistan, that will appear in Rolling Stone magazine on Friday.
In the eight-page article, released to reporters on Monday ahead of publication, McChrystal appears to belittle Vice President Joe Biden and accuses Karl Eikenberry, the U.S.
ambassador to Kabul, of undermining his war plan within the administration.
Asked by the Rolling Stone reporter about what he now feels of the war strategy advocated by Biden last fall — fewer troops, more drone attacks — the article reports that
McChrystal and his aides attempted to come up with a good one-liner to dismiss the question. "Are you asking about Vice President Biden?" McChrystal reportedly jokes. "Who's
that?"
Later in the article, McChrystal turns more serious when asked about cables sent last fall to Washington by Eikenberry. The cables called into question the major troop increase
advocated by McChrystal's team and the U.S.'s backing of Afghan President Hamid Karzai — views that the ambassador had not previously raised with McChrystal or his staff.
"I like Karl, I've known him for years, but they'd never said anything like that to us before," McChrystal is quoted as saying. "Here's one that covers his flank for the history
books. Now if we fail, they can say, 'I told you so."
The article, titled "The Runaway General," has already caused nervousness inside the Pentagon, where memories are still fresh of another blistering profile that got a top
commander in hot water: an August 2008 cover story in Esquire <hop://wvav.esquire.com/features/fox-fallon > on Adm. William "Fox" Fallon, then commander of all U.S.
forces in the Middle East and Central Asia. The article eventually played a part in Fallon's resignation two years ago.
In that Esquire piece, however, Fallon appeared to directly contradict White House policy on Iran and other parts of the Middle East; the Rolling Stone article makes no such
allegation, but rather is full of jokey put-downs of important Washington players.
Comments in the article attributed to anonymous McChrystal aides are particularly harsh towards some senior members of the Obama administration, including National Security
Adviser James Jones, and other leading politicians, like Sens. John Kerry (D., Mass.) and John McCain (R., Ariz). They also make some unflattering references to
PresidentBarack Obama himself, saying the president didn't seem to know who McChrystal was when he appointed him to run the war early last year.
Only Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is portrayed as having strongly backed McChrystal's plan for Afghanistan, is singled out for praise by the anonymous McChrystal

Top US Afghan commander mocks Biden: report
(AFP) — 1 hour ago
WASHINGTON — The US commander in Afghanistan mocks the vice president and denounces a top diplomat in a magazine interview, while his aides
speak dismissively of President Barack Obama.
Tensions between General Stanley McChrystal and the White House are on full display in an unflattering profile in Rolling Stone of the commander of US
and NATO forces in the Afghan war.
McChrystal jokes sarcastically about preparing to answer a question referring to Vice President Joe Biden, known as a skeptic of the commander's war
strategy.
"Are you asking about Vice President Biden?' McChrystal says with a laugh. 'Who's that?'" the article quotes him as saying.
"Biden?' suggests a top adviser. 'Did you say: Bite Me?"
McChrystal tells the magazine that he felt "betrayed" by the US ambassador to Kabul, Karl Eikenberry, in a White House debate over war strategy last year.
Referring to a leaked internal memo from Eikenberry that questioned McChrystal's request for more troops, the commander suggested the ambassador had
tried to protect himself for history's sake.
"I like Karl, I've known him for years, but they'd never said anything like that to us before," McChrystal tells the magazine.
"Here's one that covers his flank for the history books. Now if we fail, they can say, ?I told you so."
Eikenberry, himself a former commander in Afghanisan, had written to the White House saying Afghan President Hamid Karzai was an unreliable partner
and that a surge of troops could draw the United States into a open-ended quagmire.
The article revisits the friction between the White House and the military last fall as Obama debated whether to grant McChrystal's request for tens of
thousands of reinforcements.
Although Obama in the end granted most of what McChrystal asked for, the strategy review was a difficult time, the general tells the magazine.
"I found that time painful," McChrystal says. "I was selling an unsellable position."
An unnamed adviser to McChrystal alleges the general came away unimpressed after a meeting with Obama in the Oval Office a year ago, just after the
president named him to take over in Afghanistan.
"It was a 10-minute photo op," the general's adviser says.
"Obama clearly didn?t know anything about him, who he was.., he didn?t seem very engaged.
"The boss was pretty disappointed," says the adviser.
The profile, titled "The Runaway General," portrays his aides as profane and intensely loyal to McChrystal, while arguing the general has seized control over
the war on the military and diplomatic fronts.
The four-star general also derides the hard-charging top US envoy to the region, Richard Holbrooke, and complains about a dinner with an unnamed French
minister during a visit to Paris.
"Oh, not another e-mail from Holbrooke," McChrystal says, looking at his messages on a mobile phone. "I don't even want to open it."
In a hotel room in Paris getting ready for a dinner with a French official, McChrystal says: "How'd I get screwed into going to this dinner?"
"The dinner comes with the position, sir," says his aide, Colonel Charlie Flynn.
"Hey, Charlie," McChrystal says, "does this come with the position?"
McChrystal gives him the middle finger.

Subject Strategy session
Cheryl and I discussed how to do an effective strategy session. Monday early afternoon is the first clear shot we have at
getting the right group of people in the room together for an extended period of time.
We propose to start the discussion from the following premise: We've addressed, in one fashion or another, to one
degree of satisfaction or another, most of the major items we set out at the beginning of last near. We've moved the
needle, but we haven't changed the game. Now the question is, what are the major milestones over the next 12-18
months? What should we be aiming at? And especially, what are some potential game-changers — moves that would
shift the global landscape in meaningful and long-lasting ways?
Everything will be on the table — regional issues, transnational issues, etc. Everyone should read the book of look-ahead
papers; identify things they think we should pursue; and add ideas — especially creative and far-reaching ideas — on top
of what's contained in them.
We propose the following roster:
Jim
Jack
Bill
AMS
Derek
CDM
Jake
Rich
Kurt
Judith
Harold
Let us know what you think.

Statement by Ambassador Mark Sedwill, NATO's Senior Civilian Representative to Afghanistan
Stan McChrystal is one of the finest men I have ever known. He is and will remain a lifelong
friend.
General McChrystal has also been an outstanding military commander who was pivotal in
creating and driving forward NATO's strategy in Afghanistan to regain the initiative against
the insurgency, resolve the political tensions which fuel it and transition responsibility to the
Government of Afghanistan as we help build their capabilities.
This strategy remains the basis of the campaign. The campaign remains on course. The
Afghan people should have no doubt of our commitment to build a stable Afghanistan and a
safer world.
I look forward to working with General David Petraeus whose remarkable track record speaks
for itself. He will provide the continuity and strong leadership required to meet the challenges
ahead.

US Senators blast 'dysfunctional' diplomats in Afghanistan
WASHINGTON, June 23, 2010 (AFP) - President Barack Obama must overhaul the "completely
dysfunctional" civilian side of US-led efforts in Afghanistan or risk losing the high-
stakes conflict, three hawkish US Senators said Wednesday.
Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, joined by Independent Senator Joe
Lieberman, stopped just shy of explicitly urging Obama to replace Ambassador Karl
Eikenberry but had harsh words for US diplomacy in Kabul.
"The civilian side is, in my view, completely dysfunctional. The relationship between the
civilian leadership and (Afghan) President (Hamid) Karzai has to be changed and
repaired," said Graham.
"I would urge the president to look at this as a chance to put new people on the ground
without old baggage. And if we don't change quickly, we're going to lose a war we can't
afford to lose," warned Graham.
Graham and his colleagues warmly praised Obama's decision to replace General Stanley
McChrystal with General David Petraeus, but cautioned that diplomatic failures could
hamstring his efforts to manage the increasingly unpopular war.
McCain suggested that Obama bring back veteran diplomat Ryan Crocker, who was ambassador
to Baghdad when he and Petraeus enacted the "surge" strategy credited in Washington with
bringing Iraq back from the brink of civil war.
"We might suggest that a consideration be given to reuniting the Crocker-Petraeus team,
although I'm sure that Ambassador Crocker will never forgive me for saying that, since
he's enjoying his retirement," McCain said with a chuckle.
"There is discontent -- or let me say, there is a lack of coordination and teamwork --
between the military and civilian side, both at the embassy and other areas, in
Afghanistan that needs to be repaired," said McCain.
Lieberman took a slightly softer line, but underlined he felt "there is not the kind of
unity in Afghanistan between our civilian and military leadership" that is needed to
prosecute Obama's counterinsurgency strategy.
The senators sharply criticized McChrystal over a Rolling Stone magazine profile in which
the general and his aides are quoted as mocking top Obama national security aides, from
Vice President Joe Biden on down.

saying he felt "betrayed" by Eikenberry, who had raised pointed objections to his
strategy.

Karzai's Chief of Staff, Omar Daudzai, called Annie this morning to relay that President Karzai did sign the Afghan Peace

We do not yet have a copy of the signed decree (we are working to get a copy for our LES to translate, however, it is not
yet available from any of our sources). Based on previous drafts, we believe the decree will:

• Establish the High Peace Council (HPC) called for at the National Consultative Peace Jirga. The HPC will provide
political and strategic leadership to the Afghan Peace and Reintegration Program (APRP);
• Establish the bureaucratic and organizational structure and space for the reintegration Joint Secretariat,
including appointment of an interim CEO (presumably Stanekzai — although his future long-term tenure in the
job is unclear).
• Provide clear instructions to line ministries to support reintegration and allocate representatives to the Joint
Secretariat;
• Provide clear instructions to sub-national officials to support reintegration and to establish provincial and district
reintegration committees in accordance with the interim guidance released by the Afghan National Security
Council in April;
• Define a process to absorb Peace through Strength (PTS) and other reintegration structures (potentially
Disarmament of Illegal Armed Groups — DIAG) under the national and provincial structures of the APRP; and
• Most importantly, give the requisite Presidential imprimatur to the program.
A second decree should be issued prior to or concurrent with the Kabul Conference appointing the members of the High
Peace Council and a permanent CEO for the APRP.
As soon as we have a copy of the decree and can confirm its contents, we will send a Front Channel cable; in the
meantime, we are informing the Desk, SRAP and General Petraeus' staff that the decree has been signed.

Subject: The political ramifications of the Greek/European debt crisis
As you know, the EU-IMF-USG consensus hope motivating the Greek bailout is that it will buy time for Spain, Portugal,
etc. From widening credit spreads to falling stock prices, most relevant market indicators are responding with doubt.
Former IMF Chief Economist and NYT Columnist (and influential blogger for bond traders) Simon Johnson has an
important rejoinder to this consensus hope in today's NYT, full text pasted below.
As the EU has no playbook for most of the pressing questions it faces, my staff is working to
brainstorm as to the least bad of what are only sobering options.
This is long but worth it.
May 6, 2010, 6:11 amIt's Not About Greece AnymoreBy PETER BOONE AND SIMON JOHNSONLouisa Gouliamaki/Agence
France-Presse — Getty Images Protesters waved flags from the Acropolis archaeological site behind banners in English
and Greek hung in front of the Parthenon temple in Athens.Peter Boone is chairman of the charity Effective Intervention
and a research associate at the Center for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. He is also a
principal in Salute Capital Management Ltd. Simon Johnson, the former chief economist at the International Monetary
Fund, is the co-author of "13 Bankers."The Greek "rescue" package announced last weekend is dramatic, unprecedented
and far from enough to stabilize the euro zone.The Greek government and the European Union leadership, prodded by
the International Monetary Fund, are finally becoming realistic about the dire economic situation in Greece. They have
abandoned previous rounds of optimistic forecasts and have now admitted to a profoundly worse situation. This new
program calls for "fiscal adjustments" — cuts to the fiscal deficit, mostly through spending cuts — totaling 11 percent of
gross domestic product in 2010, 4.3 percent in 2011, and 2 percent in 2012 and 2013. The total debt-to-G.D.P. ratio
peaks at 149 percent in 2012-13 before starting a gentle glide path back down to sanity.This new program is honest
enough to show why it is unlikely to succeed.Daniel Gros, an eminent economist on euro zone issues based in Brussels,
has argued that for each 1 percent of G.D.P. decline in Greek government spending, total demand in the country falls by
2.5 percent of G.D.P. If the government reduces spending by 15 percent of G.D.P. — the initial shock to demand could
be well over 30 percent of G.D.P.Obviously this simple rule does not work with such large numbers, but it illustrates that
Greece is likely to experience a very sharp recession — and there is substantial uncertainty around how bad the
economy will get. The program announced last weekend assumes Greek G.D.P. falls by 4 percent this year, then by
another 2.6 percent in 2011, before recovering to positive growth in 2012 and beyond.Such figures seem extremely
optimistic, particularly in the face of the civil unrest now sweeping Greece and the deep hostility expressed toward

Greece in some northern European policy circles.The pattern of growth is critical because, under this program, Greece
needs to grow out of its debt problem soon. Greece's debt-to-G.D.P. ratio will be a debilitating 145 percent at the end
of 2011.Now consider putting more realistic growth figures into the I.M.F. forecast for Greece's economy — e.g., with
G.D.P. declining 12 percent in 2011, then the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio may reach 155 percent. At these levels, with a 5
percent real interest rate and no growth, the country needs a primary surplus at 8 percent of G.D.P. to keep the debt-to-
G.D.P. ratio stable. It will be nowhere near that level. The I.M.F. program has Greece running a primary budget deficit
of around 1 percent of G.D.P. in that year, and that assumes a path for Greek growth that can be regarded only as an
"upside scenario."The politics of these implied budget surpluses remains brutal. Since most Greek debt is held abroad,
roughly 80 percent of the budget savings the Greek government makes go straight to Germans, French and other foreign
debt holders (mostly banks). If growth turns out poorly, will the Greeks be prepared for ever-tougher austerity to pay
the Germans? Even if everything goes well, Greek citizens seem unlikely to welcome this version of their "new normal."
Last week the European leadership panicked — very late in the day — when it realized that the euro zone itself was at
risk of a meltdown. If the euro zone proves unwilling to protect a member like Greece from default, then bond investors
will run from Portugal and Spain also — if you doubt this, study carefully the interlocking debt picture published
recently in The New York Times. Higher yields on government debt would have caused concerns about potential bank
runs in these nations, and then spread to more nations in Europe.When there is such a "run," it is not clear where it
stops. In the hazy distance, Belgium, France, Austria and many others were potentially at risk.
Even the Germans cannot afford to bail out those nations.Slapped in the face by this ugly scenario, the Europeans
decided to throw everything they and the I.M.F. had at bailing out Greece. The program as announced has only a small
chance of preventing eventual Greek bankruptcy, but it may still slow or avert a dangerous spiral downward — and
enormous collateral damage — in the rest of Europe.The I.M.F. floated in some fashion an alternative scenario with a
debt restructuring, but this was rejected by both the European Union and the Greek authorities. This is not a surprise;
leading European policy makers are completely unprepared for broader problems that would follow a Greek
"restructuring," because markets would immediately mark down the debt (i.e., increase the yields) for Portugal, Spain,
Ireland and even Italy.The fear and panic in the face of this would be unparalleled in modern times: When the Greeks
pay only 50 percent on the face value of their debt, what should investors expect from the Portuguese and Spanish? It
all becomes arbitrary, including which countries are dragged down.Someone has to decide who should be defended and
at what cost, and the European structures are completely unsuited to this kind of tough decision-making under
pressure.ln the extreme downside scenario, Germany is the only obvious safe haven within the euro zone, so its
government bond yields would collapse while other governments face sharply rising yields. The euro zone would likely
not hold together.There is still a narrow escape path, without immediate debt default and the chaos that that would
produce:-
Talk down the euro — moving toward parity with the American dollar would help lift growth across the euroz one..
As the euro falls, bond yields will rise on the euro zone periphery. This will create episodes of panic. Enough short-term
financing must be in place to support the rollover of government debt..
Once the euro has fallen a great deal, announce the European Central Bank will support the euro at those levels (i.e.,
prevent appreciation, with G-20 tacit agreement), and also support the peripheral euro zone nations viewed as solvent
by buying their bonds whenever markets are chaotic.-
At that stage, but not before, the euro zone leadership needs to push weaker governments to restructure. That will
include Greece and perhaps also Portugal. Hopefully, in this scenario Spain can muddle through.•
European banks should be recapitalized as necessary and have most of their management replaced. This is a massive
failure of euro groupthink — including most notably at the political level — but there is no question that bank executives
have not behaved responsibly in a long while and should be replaced en masse.To the extent possible, some of the
ensuing losses should be shared with bank creditors. But be careful what you wish for. The bankers are powerful for a

USUN PRESS RELEASE #157 August
2, 2010
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Statement by Ambassador Susan E. Rice, U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations, on Secretary
General Ban's Panel Concerning the May 31 Flotilla Incident
The United States welcomes today's announcement by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon of the
establishment of a Panel regarding the incident of May 31st- We thank both governments for the constructive
and cooperative spirit they have shown and the Secretary General for his leadership and determination. The
Panel, which has the support of both Israel and Turkey, will receive and review the reports of each
government's national investigation into the incident and make recommendations as to how to avoid such
incidents in the future. This Panel is not a substitute for those national investigations. It complements them,
affording Israel and Turkey the opportunity to present the conclusions of their investigations to the international
community. The focus of the Panel is appropriately on the future and on preventing such incidents from
recurring. The United States also hopes that the Panel can serve as a vehicle to enable Israel and Turkey to
move beyond the recent strains in their relationship and repair their strong historic ties.
The United States expects that the Panel will operate in a transparent and credible manner and that its work will
be the primary method for the international community to review the incident, obviating the need for any
overlapping international inquiries. The United States welcomes the naming of the former Prime Minister of
New Zealand, Geoffrey Palmer, as Chair and the outgoing President of Colombia, Alvaro Uribe, as Vice-Chair.
We look forward to the announcement of the two additional members from Israel and Turkey.

Tensions between Eikenberry, McChrystal will be focus of their
Washington visit
By Joshua Partlow
Sunday, May 9,2010; A01
They are both decorated generals, West Point graduates who studied at Harvard University and earnest
taskmasters who would rather work than sleep.
The U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, Karl W. Eikenberry, and the top U.S. military commander there, Gen.
Stanley A. McChrystal, assumed their posts amid lofty expectations that they could re-create the hand-in-glove
partnership that Gen. David H. Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker had while leading the war effort in
Iraq.
But the Eikenberry-and-McChrystal team that returns to Washington this week, alongside Afghan President
Hamid Karzai, has a much different dynamic.
Both men said in interviews that they enjoy a productive relationship and have built stronger bonds between
troops and civilians across Afghanistan. Still, they have had significant disagreements over the course of the
Afghanistan war and have struggled to align their visions for how to work with Karzai's government, according
to interviews with U.S., NATO and Afghan officials.
Few critics suggest that those differences have harmed U.S. interests in Afghanistan. People who have worked
with both men said, however, that clear tensions exist at the top of the Obama administration's most important
military and foreign policy endeavor.
At times their differences over strategy have been public, particularly after two of Eikenberry's cables to
Washington last year were leaked to the news media. The cables warned that McChrystal's request for new
troops might be counterproductive as Karzai was "not an adequate strategic partner." McChrystal's staff

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770242 Date: 08/31/2015
members were particularly upset that they weren't made aware of Eikenberry's position before he sent the cables
to Washington, they said in interviews.
Eikenberry has resisted some of McChrystal's wartime experiments. The ambassador refused to release funds to
expand a military effort to turn villagers into armed guards. He opposed one Army brigade's plan to form an
anti-Taliban alliance with a Pashtun tribe and funnel it development money. He criticized the military's proposal
to buy generators and diesel fuel for the energy-starved city of Kandahar and supported a longer-term
hydroelectric dam project.
Their views have diverged despite shared experience: Eikenberry served 18 months as the NATO commander
in Afghanistan, the job McChrystal now holds, before retiring from the military and returning as ambassador.
As McChrystal has overhauled the war strategy, some of the legacy he is undoing is Eikenberry's.
Eikenberry wanted to become NATO's senior civilian representative, in addition to his job as ambassador, but
McChrystal recommended against it, according to diplomats in Kabul. A British diplomat, Mark Sedwill, got
the job.
"You have two generals of similar rank who don't agree on the policy, who apparently don't like each other. It
makes for a difficult relationship," said Peter W. Galbraith, who served as the top U.S. official in the United
Nations' mission to Afghanistan during last year's contested presidential election.
Both men have tried to dispel notions that they disagree on strategy and don't get along.
"The best metaphor I can give you is of an athletic team," Eikenberry said. "We play different positions. We
have different but complementary roles. Of course, sometimes we're going to disagree on what's the best play to
call, but we're absolutely committed as teammates to see the president's strategy is well-executed."
McChrystal said that he and Eikenberry cooperate effectively and that their relationship should not be measured
against the Petraeus-Crocker pairing in Iraq.
"We've known each other for many years. We talk through all the things we deal with," McChrystal said. "Some
people are looking for an Iraq model. But Iraq wasn't a 46-nation coalition."
Civil-military integration
The two generals first crossed professional paths in 2002, when McChrystal, who had worked as chief of staff
under Gen. Dan K. McNeill, then coalition commander, helped prepare Eikenberry for a job in Kabul building
the fledgling Afghan National Army. Later, McChrystal ran the Joint Special Operations Command when
Eikenberry held the top military job in Afghanistan.
They now work more independently because their roles aren't perfectly aligned, they said, with McChrystal in
charge of the 130,000-strong NATO coalition, not just the American contingent.
Some disagreements between the men may reflect growing pains, as the military makes room for what has
become the second-largest U.S. embassy in the world, after the one in Iraq. When-President °barna took office
last year, there were 360 American civilians in Afghanistan. Now there are more than 1,000 and counting, the
most rapid growth of a U.S. civilian mission since the Vietnam War.
Military field commanders who once may have had political advisers now share authority with co-equal civilian
representatives backed by growing staffs. The result is a more forceful civilian voice in decision-making.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770242 Date: 08/31/2015
When Eikenberry has resisted a military proposal, the rationale is often that he does not want to undermine the
Afghan government and the development of its security forces. He says that he must take into account factors
beyond short-term stability and that programs without Afghan government ownership won't be sustainable.
"I think that both of us are very proud of the degree of civil-military integration we've been able to achieve in
the year that we've been here together," Eikenberry said. "So, of course, there's going to be different
perspectives, there's going to be robust debates, and you really want that. You've got to encourage that."
Divided over Karzai
Perhaps the most visible difference in approach is how the men work with Karzai.
McChrystal has adopted a role akin to chief diplomat, building a close partnership with Karzai. In monthly
White House review sessions, McChrystal has argued that U.S. officials should show more public deference to
Karzai, who he frequently reminds others is "the elected leader of a sovereign country," administration officials
said.
In the interview, McChrystal called Karzai a "great partner" who has been "absolutely straightforward with me
and been reliable."
Some officials said he has built his relationship with Karzai at the expense of candor. In some instances, he has
chosen a less politically controversial path, U.S. officials said, citing his decision to work with Ahmed Wali
Karzai, the president's half brother, rather than stress his alleged criminal activity.
"If I don't have credibility with President Karzai, then I think I can't be an effective commander here,"
McChrystal said. "And it doesn't mean just getting along with him and telling him what he wants to hear. It's
convincing him that I'm being a reliable and honest interlocutor with him."
Eikenberry, meanwhile, has had to deliver tougher messages about corruption and governance that often upset
Karzai, and his rapport with the mercurial president has seemed to suffer.
During a lengthy policy review in the fall, Eikenberry argued against sending additional U.S. troops to
Afghanistan. And U.S. officials said he continues to think that the United States should find other Afghan
figures, including provincial leaders, to work with rather than rely so heavily on Karzai. Eikenberry's position
infuriated Karzai, who often views U.S. support for "sub-national governments" in Afghanistan as a threat to his
authority.
Karzai is a cunning politician who has tried to play Eikenberry and McChrYstal off each other and exploit any
political differences, U.S. officials said. In recent months, when Karzai has come under U.S. pressure to reform
his corrupt government, he has often lashed out publicly.
Since McChrystal took command in June, he has met Karzai more than 45 times, mostly one-on-one, including
a regular Sunday morning chat in the presidential palace. In an effort to present Karzai as commander in chief,
McChrystal has flown him across the country on five "battlefield circulations."
McChrystal has done more than his predecessors, including Eikenberry, to minimize civilian casualties, such as
restricting the use of air power and night raids. He has regularly apologized to Karzai for civilian deaths and
shown him video and slide presentations to explain how such mistakes occur.

"He was the first military man to really show that he respected and would respond to Karzai's agenda, civilian
casualties, of course, being the biggest issue," one senior NATO official said. "In a sense, Karzai said, 'Here's a
soldier that finally I can deal with.'"
Crocker, the former U.S. ambassador to Baghdad, said he and Petraeus rarely differed over policy or approach
and carefully calibrated their relationship with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouni al-Maliki, another, complicated
leader. The two almost always saw Maliki together. When meeting him alone, they would brief each other
before and after.
Of McChrystal and Eikenberry, Crocker said: "They need to resolve any differences among themselves or take
it back to Washington because the stakes in Afghanistan are too great not to have a unified effort."
Partlow reported from Kabul. Staff writers Rajiv Chandrasekaran and Scott Wilson in Washington contributed

Jake, Joe,
Here is the update from 10 and PRM for the Secretary (as you recall she had met with the outgoing head of UNFPA):
Eric and I would like to update you on the Secretary-General's selection process of the next head of UNFPA.
Working closely with PRM and USUN, we gathered 22 names as possible candidates from various sources, including
NG0s, governments, and respected individuals in the health sector. We whittled down this list to three people who
have qualifications that we believe are necessary for the job: a deep understanding of and support for UNFPA's
reproductive health/family planning mission and its critical role in implementing the 1CPD Program of Action, strong
leadership and advocacy skills, and strong management ability to oversee an organization with over 2000 employees
worldwide.
We see the leading candidates as:
USUN concurs and is in touch with the SG's office to convey our views. The SG will make his own shortlist based on a UN
review panel's recommendations. He is expected to announce his selection in October to allow the designee some
overlap with the incumbent, Thoraya Obaid, whose term expires at the end of the year. We will keep you apprised as
the process continues.

I wanted to give you the latest on the New START briefings for Baker and Kissinger.
Baker: I've arranged for a phone briefing for Baker with Gary Samore, Jim Miller, Mike Elliott, and Tom DAgostino
tomorrow at 11:30 am. The briefing with last 30 minutes and they are prepared to answer any questions he has. Baker is
fairly familiar with the main issues, having already spoken with John Kerry and others.
Kissinger: I secured a 45 minute briefing for Kissinger on the 19th (next Wednesday) from 2:30 to 3:15. If you agree, you
can host it here in your office.

See email chain below. We need to get this info into the system particularly in EUR and the Gulf region but we need to
do so carefully and as David points out with a great deal of sensitivity for the families.
For example when I was in Jeddah I met with a group of prominent Islamic scholars
several of whom were leading Saudi doctors. We talked about ways they could reach out to their colleagues in Pakistan
and Afghanistan. We should get them this information and see if we can enlist them in this effort. Walter will know how
to reach them. David will advise on best way to coordinate with families.

Here is what PJ said on the subject:
The Secretary this morning spoke with Turkish Foreign Minister Davutoglu regarding Iran. During the call, the Secretary
stressed that, in our view, Iran's recent diplomacy was an attempt to stop Security Council action without actually taking
steps to address international concerns about its nuclear program. There's nothing new and nothing encouraging in
Iran's recent statements. It has failed to demonstrate good faith and build confidence with the international
community, which was the original intent of the Tehran research reactor proposal. It has yet to formally respond to the
IAEA. She stressed that the burden is with Iran and its lack of seriousness about engagement requires us to intensify
efforts to apply greater pressure on Iran. That was the primary purpose of the conversation. They briefly touched on
other subjects, including Middle East peace and the relationship between Turkey and Azerbaijan.

Subject: Iran human rights statement
One thing I forgot to mention - Bill B and Mike Posner recommend that you release the below statement. Apparently
Hamidi's execution is imminent. With your approval we'll put out.
DRAFT STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON
Urging Iran to Respect the Fundamental Freedoms of its Citizens
The United States is deeply concerned that Iran continues to deny its citizens their civil rights, as well as to intimidate
and detain those Iranians who seek to hold their government accountable and who stand up for the rights of their
fellow citizens. We remain troubled by the case of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, who garnered international attention
for her verdict of death by stoning. While the Iranian government later stated she would not face execution by stoning,
her fate has been left unclear. We are also troubled by reports that Ebrahim Hamidi, an 18-year old charged with
homosexuality, faces imminent execution despite the fact that he is currently without legal representation. Neither of
their cases have proceeded with the transparency or due process enshrined in Iran's own constitution and their lawyer,
Mohammad Mostafaei, felt that he had no other choice than to flee Iran after he had been questioned by authorities
and his family members had been detained.
We are also concerned about the fate of Iranians who are in danger of imminent execution for exercising their right to
free expression after the June 2009 elections, including Jafar Kazemi, Mohammad Haj Aghaei, and Javad Lan.
The United States urges the Iranian government to halt these executions in accordance with its international obligations
to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and calls for the immediate release of all political prisoners
and imprisoned human rights defenders. The United States will continue to stand with people all around the world who
seek to exercise their universal rights and to speak out in defense of human liberties.

Subject: women and reconciliation
In light of our discussion re. women and reconciliation, I wanted to alert you to a recent incident that has
generated a great deal of concern among Afghan women. Two days ago, a local Taliban commander executed a
pregnant widow for having an "illicit affair" (the man was not punished). While there are varying accounts of
the incident, the authorities have confirmed that she was shot in the head several times after being flogged up to
200 times in Qadis district (which is completely under the control of the Taliban) of Badghis.Government
authorities have condemned the incident, noting that due process was not carried out.
In meetings today, Afghan women leaders, including some who in the past accepted reconciliation as inevitable,
expressed both fear and bitterness over the incident and shared concerns that such brutality against
women would be far more prevalent if reconciliation occurred. They noted frustration about the lack of
transparency in the government's reintegration and reconciliation processes. A number of women questioned
what the government is willing to bargain in order to achieve a peace settlement and the extent to which it is
prepared to roll women's rights back to appease the Taliban. They noted that women's rights are treated as a
nuisance by the government leadership rather than as an important element of the peace process.
Melanne also met with President Karzai and was dismayed when he told her that there weren't any women's
names on the list of potential candidates for the High Peace Council. Stanekzai is said to have come up with a
list of 300 names (FRIC reports that women were on the list) that has been wittled down to about 30 names.
While the list is far from being finalized, President Karzai does not currently appear to be prioritizing women's
inclusion in the body--despite the fact that the APRP commits to it. Afghan women have called for 20% to 30%
inclusion of women in the High Peace Council and the Joint Secretariat. We will be meeting with Stanekzai
trmw and raise this issue.

Vail felt that Anne's assessment of the new Pakistani submission was too negative. He believes it is their opening
position - that it is quite sophisticated - and that it represents a real step forward from their initial 56-page list of

He acknowledges that it is lighter on the things we care about, but notes for example that productive items like the
strategic dialogue get far more space than unproductive items like civ-nuke.
He very much agrees with your concept of annotating the document.

Dear WMCL Colleagues,
It will take some time for me to get my feet underneath me, and to catch up on all left undone during my recent
involuntary vacation in Rwanda's prisons. However, I am well-enough to begin to appreciate how much the entire
College community did to assist in securing my release.
I will probably never know all of the contributions to the campaign for my release that came from each of my WMCL
colleagues, although Eric has filled me in on many of the efforts within the College, and reaching beyond the College,
that helped turn my detention into a spontaneous movement for my release. I owe each of you a lot, particularly Jane
and Melissa, who had to deal with the mess of ungraded exams and unreturned calls and emails.
My colleagues who wrote and called others on my behalf and even showed-up at rallies have my deepest appreciation.
While my detention and release have importance for our community, I thought it might be helpful to put your efforts
into the larger context, which iput me in danger in Rwanda. At the bottom of this message is a Voice of America story
that explains that my arrest is part of a much more significant story, which implicates the U.S. in the deaths of millions in
Central Africa over the past three decades.
Since I have already promised my wife to NEVER do anything like this again, it is not a big stretch to make the same
promise to each of you....but it is great to know that you were there when I needed you. Many, many thanks.
your grateful colleague,
C. Peter

Rwanda Tribunal Lawyers Denounce Killing of One of Their Own
Nico Colombant I Washington 17 July 2010
An association of lawyers working at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda has denounced the recent killing of
one of their colleagues. They also expressed grave concern at the series of murders, arrests and assassination attempts
in the run-up to Rwanda's presidential election next month.
The statement by a collective of defense lawyers at the Tanzania-based tribunal for Rwanda, known by its acronym ICTR
(sic), was released following the killing of law professor Jwani Mwaikusa earlier this week near his home in Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania.
The head of the association, American lawyer and law professor Peter Erlinder, told VOA Mwaikusa had been very active
at the tribunal. "Professor Mwaikusa had been successful in preventing a number of cases from being transferred from
the ICTR to Rwanda and he also had recently completed a trial in which he announced he was going to be filing an
appeal," he said.
Mwaikusa had said the trials would not be fair if they were held in Rwanda.
Erlinder himself was recently jailed for nearly a month in Rwanda on charges of challenging the government's official
history of what happened during the 1994 genocide, after trying to represent an opposition leader who was also jailed
on genocide denial charges.
The statement calls for an independent investigation of the Mwaikusa murder, as well as guarantees from the United
Nations Security Council to ensure the safety of the tribunal's defense lawyers.
Erlinder also said evidence necessary to defense teams is being withheld at the tribunal, and he called for fully disclosing
evidence of crimes committed in Rwanda in 1994 by both the former government and current leadership.
"We have a situation where the entire defense at the ICTR is finding itself in a situation where it is very hard to do its
work," he said.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770507 Date: 08/31/2015
The statement by the lawyers said they were afraid Mwaikusa's murder was not isolated. It followed last month's
assassination attempt against a former ally turned opponent of Rwandan President Paul Kagame in South Africa, the
killing of a journalist in Kigali who was investigating the assassination bid, and the near decapitation of an official from
Rwanda's opposition Democratic Green Party, who was found dead near his car earlier this week near the southern
town of Butare.
Rwandan authorities have denied any link between the series of murders and attacks and the upcoming election, saying
those who insinuate a crackdown is taking place are in their words "frustrated" politicians.
Mr. Kagame, who led the Uganda-backed ethnic minority Tutsi rebellion that took over Rwanda from its Hutu-led
government after the genocide, was elected in 2003 with more than 95 percent of the vote. He has expressed
confidence he will be re-elected in August.
Rwandan police say they arrested a man in connection with the killing of the opposition leader, saying he was a
businessman connected with the Green Party.
Several suspects have been arrested in the case of the journalist.
But there is growing international pressure on Rwanda's government to clarify the situation.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for a full investigation into the deaths of the journalist and the
opposition leader.
Meanwhile, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero recently called off a planned meeting with Mr.
Kagame, after protests by Spanish human rights groups.
In Spain, a case is pending against dozens of current and former Rwandan officers who have been indicted on charges of
genocide and crimes against humanity for alleged reprisal killings during and after the 1994 genocide, in which hundreds
of thousands of people, most of them ethnic Tutsis, were killed.
Spanish law allows its courts to prosecute crimes against humanity even if those crimes took place elsewhere.

Dear Mr. Koh,
I am a colleague of Professor Erlinder and also a graduate of Yale Law School ('79). I invoke the latter connection in
hopes of obtaining your attention to a plea on Professor Erlinder's behalf.
Professor Erlinder and I agree on very little politically. Indeed, we disagree on almost every issue. However, I want the
U.S. government to do everything it can to speedily obtain Professor Erlinder's release.

I readily acknowledge that I don't understand the underlying merits of the criminal matter. I have heard Professor
Erlinder's assertions that his efforts (and those of his colleagues) have exposed many previously hidden truths and those
assertions (which include condemnation of the U.N., one of my least favorite organizations) seemed credible to me.
But those merits are, in my opinion, entirely beside the point, as is the question of whether Professor Erlinder was
foolish or brave to return to Rwanda. I respect both Don Quixote and Clarence Darrow. The point is that Professor
Erlinder put himself at risk to "walk the walk" of a fundamental principle of any free society — the right to counsel. The
defendants at the Nuremberg trials had counsel. The Israelis accorded Eichmann counsel.
It now appears that Professor Erlinder's detention may turn into a covert execution. "Under intense interrogation from
detectives, detained American Prof. Peter Erlinder swallowed up to 50 tablets meant to treat hypertension and other
medical conditions — which the Police now says is also another crime, RNA can exclusively reveal." Rwandan News
Agency - Wednesday, 02 June 2010 13:28 by RNA Reporter http://rnanews.com/politics/3496-distressed-peter-erlinder-

Please use all the skills and resources at your command to cause our government to help Professor Erlinder to freedom
before it is too late.
Thank you.

CAIRO (AP) - Egypt says more work needs to be done to bridge the gap between Israel and the Palestinians before they
can move to direct peace talks. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
met separately with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo. None of them spoke to the press afterward. But
Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit told reporters the basis to move from indirect to direct talks is still
"lacking."

Subject: "Do More"
The expression "do more" repeated incessantly in today's press is essentially a negative characterization of the
Secretary's position. In general, it is code for "After so much cost and so many losses and so many bombs in our cities,
the Americans are telling us we're still not doing enough." This negative interpretation is used by the PakMil to convince
Pakistanis that the U.S. is a malign influence and to avoid taking the steps we seek.
When you brief her this morning suggest the following:
We avoid literally using the words "do more;" but
Do not hesitate to specify what we want them to do; and
Let's push back on this view: We acknowledge their contributions and their losses — and we are helping. We-
would never ask Pakistan to do more alone —we are doing more, too, including supporting Pakistan militarily
and economically. Freedom requires constant vigilance and democracy is never "done."

Subject: TPs
Below are points for the press on the plane. I'll have a hard copy printed:
First major ministerial in Afghanistan since the 1970s. The very fact of it is a big deal.
Context is important. This is not out of the blue, it's not just a random gathering; it's part of a systematic process:
Karzai's inauguration, announcement of the President's strategy, London conference, Peace Jirga, and now the Kabul
conference.
Increasing Afghan leadership and ownership: They are presenting a set of concrete programs on governance, service
delivery, security transition, economic development, and reintegration. These programs are detailed; they are serious;
and they reflect months of work and consultation.
Increasing international alignment: The international community is coordinating with each other - through ISAF, Sedwill,
de Mistura, etc. - and aligning its efforts with the Afghan programs and priorities being set forth at this conference. This
is NOT a pledging conference. It is an opportunity to ensure we are effectively supporting Afghan government
leadership and ownership
Follow-through and accountability: In his inauguration, Karzai laid out a credible vision; in London, the Afghan
government committed to developing and pursuing specific plans in a variety of areas; at Kabul, we'll be heavily focused
on implementation. This is about mutual accountability for the pledges made and the programs set forth.
July 2011: The president's strategy reflects both urgency and resolve: increased resources and intensity in our efforts to
take the fight to the enemy and to build Afghan capacity to effect a conditions-based transition; and a long-term civilian
commitment to support Afghanistan long into the future.
Clear strategy: Reverse the momentum of the Taliban; build the capacity of Afghan security forces; and as Afghans
develop the capability to stabilize their country, we must draw down our combat presence and make a responsible
transition to Afghan leadership.
Clear desired end-state: An Afghan state that is willing and strong enough to ensure that global terrorists never again
have safe haven within its borders; can withstand internal and external threats; and can continue to make long-term
political and economic progress, all with sustainable levels of international support.
Civ-mil cooperation: Unfortunate to lose General McChrystal, but maintained continuity with General Petraeus and we
have only intensified our civ-mil engagement both in Kabul and Washington.
Reconciliation: Stress that it is Afghan-led. Note red-lines.

Just spoke to Doug Frantz. A little intel (or not).
As you know, Menendez is driving the train on the June 29th hearing. He will chair. Lautenberg has requested the
opportunity to ask questions from the dais, but right now the Committee is pushing back saying they don't want this to
devolve into a circus.
Committee may ask State and/or DOJ to produce witness/es who can speak to the agreements entered into that
permitted Megrahi to be prosecuted and jailed in Scotland in the first place. From State, they're not sure if that's
someone from EUR, NEA, or elsewhere within the Department. This would be at the Committee's insistence and not
necessarily Menendez's.
I asked who they think Menendez might want to call as a witness. They said Tony Blair. I laughed. They didn't. Am told
the Committee is discouraging Menendez from even making the request. We'll see.

TEHRAN (Reuters) - Turkey's Foreign Minister said that an agreement had been reached between Iran, Turkey and Brazil
over procedures to revive a stalled U.N.-backed nuclear fuel swap deal. When Ahmet Davutoglu was asked by reporters
in Tehran whether there would be agreement on the nuclear fuel swap deal, he replied: "Yes, it has been reached after
almost 18 hours of negotiations." Turkey's foreign ministry said a formal announcement might be made on the morning
of May 17 after any final revisions by the Brazilian and Iranian presidents and the Turkish Prime Minister who reached
the agreement at talks in Tehran.

'Inept' US cannot fix Afghanistan: top Saudi prince Sun, May 16, 2010
RIYADH (AFP) — An "inept" United States cannot fix Afghanistan's problems and should simply focus on "chasing the
terrorists" there, former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal said on Saturday.
The ex-ambassador to the United States also challenged Washington to produce results in just-started Middle East
peace talks, and accused US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of undermining efforts to make the region nuclear-free.
AFP — Saudi Arabia's former intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal delivers a speech during a conference ...
In a speech in Riyadh before diplomats, Turki said US-led NATO troops had irrevocably alienated the Afghan people and
had no hope of rebuilding the country.

"What Afghanistan needs now is a shift from nation-building to effectively countering terrorists," Turki told the Arab
News conference.
US President Barack Obama "should not be misdirected into believing that he can fix Afghanistan's ills by military
means."
"Hunt down the terrorists on both sides of the Afghan-Pakistan border, arrest them or kill them, and get out, and let the
Afghan people deal with their problems.
"As long as GI boots remain on Afghan soil, they remain targets of resistance for the Afghan people and ideological
mercenaries."
Turki, who has long served a central role in Saudi-Afghan relations, scolded Washington's handling of relations with
Kabul.
"The inept way in which this administration has dealt with President (Hamid) Karzai beggars disbelief and amazement.
"Both sides are now filled with resentment and a sour taste in their mouths," he said. "How can they both get out of that
situation? I don't know."
The chairman of the King Faisal Center For Research and Islamic Studies, Turki has no official position but is believed to
often reflect high level thinking in the Saudi government.
He is the brother of Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal, and analysts speculate he could become foreign minister
when Saud retires.
Turki said Arab states have given Washington four months to show progress in US-guided Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
"The Arab world has given Obama until September to get things done," said Turki.
"It is not enough to talk the talk. He has to walk the walk.
"If he does not succeed... then I (will) ask President Obama to do the morally decent gesture and recognise the
Palestinian state that he so ardently wishes to exist.
"He can then pack up and leave us in peace and let the Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese negotiate directly with the
Israelis. No more platitudes and good wishes and visions, please."
Turki also faulted the US and European approach in trying to halt Iran's alleged efforts to build a nuclear weapon.
"The discussions on Iran's nuclear ambitions started off on the wrong foot. The carrot and stick approach does not
work," he said.
For one, he said, the US and Europe have had double-standards in dealing with Iran on the one hand, and other nuclear
countries on the other.
"You cannot ask Iran to play on one level while you allow Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea to play on other levels."
Turki said a successful strategy toward Iran requires even-handedness, a "universal nuclear security umbrella" for the
countries in the area, and "a good military option" against any regional country which does not cooperate.
He said Clinton had undermined efforts to move toward a regional nuclear-free zone, after the UN Security Council's five
permanent members recently expressed support for the idea.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770554 Date: 08/31/2015
"Alas... Clinton then voided the issue of its value by stating that the conditions do not yet exist for establishing the zone,"
he said.
"Why, then, did she join the other members of the P5 in issuing their statement?"
Turki said he hoped Obama "will find the way to correct his secretary of state's nullification of making our area free of
weapons of mass destruction."
Turki also warned of rising violence in Iraq after the pullout of US troops next year, warning both internal and external
groups seek to carve up the country.
"Imagine what will happen once internal strife and fighting escalates" following the US pullout, he said.
Without a UN Security Council effort to protect Iraq's current borders, the consequence could be "regional conflict on a
scale not seen since the Ottoman-Safavid wars of the 17th and 18th centuries," he warned.

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON
Conflict Minerals in the Democratic Republic of Congo
Last year in the Democratic Republic of Congo, I spoke out against the trade in "conflict minerals" that has
funded a cycle of conflict there that has left more than 5 million people dead since 1998, displaced countless
more, and spawned an epidemic of sexual and gender-based violence.
President Obama has now signed into law a measure that will require corporations to publicly disclose what
they are doing to ensure that their products don't contain these minerals. The DRC has formally expressed its
support for this law and has thanked both the executive and legislative branches of our government. This is one
of several steps we are taking to stop this illicit and deadly trade.
After my visit to the Congo, I directed the State Department to develop a holistic strategy on this issue as part of
our broader effort to engage effectively with the DRC. We continue to work with the government to crack
down on corruption, both bilaterally and through the Great Lakes Contact Group. At the United Nations
Security Council, we successfully pushed to expand the listing criteria in the DRC Sanctions Committee to
include those supporting illegal armed groups through illicit trade of natural resources. We have provided
support for initiatives on certification and due diligence that have been initiated by the government of the DRC,
local and foreign industry groups, and regional and international institutions. And we have met with a wide
range of industry representatives and discussed the responsibility of end-users to ensure their supply chains are
free of conflict minerals.
All of these steps underscore the commitment of the United States to stand with the people of Congo and to
work toward an end to this conflict.

FYI, from WHA:
Mexican law enforcement officials cannot stop individuals and require proof of migratory status. However, like
SB1070, officials in the course of official "contact" (i.e. Traffic stops, investigations, hot pursuit) are authorized
to request proof of migratory status. They do this in practice routinely. Frequently, individuals who cannot
prove legal status are referred to INM (federal CBP-equivalent). In practice, GoM authorities at all levels
engage in exploitative treatment of migrants, primarily Central Americans heading to the US. These abuses
have been well documented by international human rights groups, as well as by multiple documentary and
news media reports.

Subject: Mexican treatment of the undocumented
FYI, from WHA:
Mexican law enforcement officials cannot stop individuals and require proof of migratory status. However, like 5131070,
officials in the course of official "contact" (i.e. Traffic stops, investigations, hot pursuit) are authorized to request proof
of migratory status. They do this in practice routinely. Frequently, individuals who cannot prove legal status are referred
to INM (federal CBP-equivalent). In practice, GoM authorities at all levels engage in exploitative treatment of migrants,
primarily Central Americans heading to the US. These abuses have been well documented by international human rights
groups, as well as by multiple documentary and news media reports.

Sydney Morning Herald) Abbas ready for direct talks with Israel
Palestinian President Abbas said he was ready for direct negotiations with Israel, following Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's accusations that the Palestinians are avoiding the talks. "We are ready to hold direct peace negotiations
with Israel," Abbas told reporters after talks with Jordan's King Abdullah II in Amman. "We have negotiated with Israeli
governments before, more than once. Why would we avoid such talks? We are not."
Netanyahu told the parliamentary committee on foreign affairs and defense earlier July 26 the Palestinians were trying
to sneak out of direct negotiations while Israel was ready to start them "immediately." "We have an understanding with
the Americans that we need to move now, without any delay, to direct negotiations, but in response, we have a clear
Palestinian attempt to avoid this process," Netanyahu said. "They are trying to stall and to sneak away from direct
negotiations and to cause the Arab League to shackle the talks."
Netanyahu's remarks come just days ahead of a meeting in Cairo between Abbas and the Arab League at which the
Palestinian leader will discuss the indirect talks with Israel, which began in May, and will also address the pressing
question of a shift to direct negotiations.
Abbas has repeatedly said he would not move to direct talks without tangible progress on the key issues of borders and
security, and without a complete freeze on Jewish settlement building on occupied Palestinian land.
Abbas is due to meet Spanish Foreign Minister Moratinos July 27 in Amman before flying to Cairo.

A new Buffalo Bill is catching the world's attention.
On the practice field Tuesday afternoon, he was just another Bill, a rookie no less, but he's
catching a lot of attention in his family's homeland.
In China this week, during a speech to dignitaries at the USA Pavilion, Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton said this:
"From Yo-Yo Ma to I.M. Pei to Commerce Secretary Gary Locke and Energy Secretary Chu,
Chinese-Americans have achieved great success in business, government, the arts, sciences and
sports. And to that end, I was pleased to hear that the Buffalo Bills have recently drafted the
first Chinese-American to play in the NFL," said Clinton.
Buffalo Bills offensive tackle Ed Wang said, "It felt good. She's a very important person, and so
for someone like that to talk about me, it just feels good."
Wang didn't know until he heard from News 4 that he was mentioned in Shanghai. The 6'5", 250
pound Bills rookie wasn't born in China, but both of his parents were Chinese Olympians in track
and field, so he loves breaking new ground in football.
>»In George's reporter's notebook, he explains why the Buffalo Bills limit media access to the
first 15 minutes of practice
"It is important to me just because I am the first, and I take a lot of pride in being Chinese, but
at the same time, I know that I'm out here to play football," said Wang.
Wang is expected to make the team, and his goal is to make a difference.

AS DELIVERED
Remarks by Ambassador Alejandro Wolff; Deputy Permanent U.S. Representative to the United Nations, at
an Emergency Session of the Security Council, May 31, 2010
Thank you, Mr. President and thank you, Assistant Secretary-General Fernandez-Taranco.
The United States is deeply disturbed by the recent violence and regrets the tragic loss of life and injuries
suffered among those involved in the incident last night aboard the Gaza-bound ships. We are working to
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770850 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770850 Date: 08/31/2015
ascertain the facts. We expect a credible and transparent investigation and strongly urge the Israeli government
to investigate the incident fully.
As I stated in the Chamber in December 2008, when we were confronted by a similar situation, mechanisms
exist for the transfer of humanitarian assistance to Gaza by member states and groups that want to do so. These
non-provocative and non-confrontational mechanisms should be the ones used for the benefit of all those in
Gaza. Direct delivery by sea is neither appropriate nor responsible, and certainly not effective, under the
circumstances.
The United States remains deeply concerned by the suffering of civilians in Gaza, and the deterioration of the
situation there, including the humanitarian and human rights situation. We continue to believe the situation is
unsustainable and is not in the interests of any of those concerned. We will continue to engage the Israelis on a
daily basis to expand the scope and type of goods allowed into Gaza to address the full range of the population's
humanitarian and recovery needs. Hamas' interference with international assistance shipments and the work of
nongovernmental organizations complicates efforts in Gaza. Its continued arms smuggling and commitment to
terrorism undermines security and prosperity for Palestinians and Israelis alike.
We will continue to work closely with the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority, along with
international NGOs and the UN, to provide adequate access for humanitarian goods, including reconstruction
materials, through the border crossings, while bearing in mind the Government of Israel's legitimate security
concerns.
Ultimately, this incident underscores the need to move ahead quickly with negotiations that can lead to a
comprehensive peace in the region. The only viable solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is an agreement,
negotiated between the parties, that ends the occupation that began in 1967 and fulfills the aspirations of both
parties for independent homelands through two states for two peoples, Israel and an independent, contiguous,
and viable state of Palestine, living side by side in peace and security. We call again on our international
partners — both inside and outside this Council — to promote an atmosphere of cooperation between the parties
and throughout the entire region.
Thank you, Mr. President.

Subject: (AP) Arab League backs Palestinians on restarting talks
CAIRO (AP) - Qatar's prime minister says the Arab nations have endorsed direct Palestinian talks with the Israelis but left
the timing to the Palestinians themselves. Sheik Hamad bin Jassem Al Thani, who chaired the meeting of Arab foreign
ministers in Cairo said July 29 the timing of the direct talks "is a matter for the Palestinian side to decide." The U.S. and
the Europeans have been pushing Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to restart the direct talks, which broke off in
2008, immediately. Abbas, however, has said he would only restart talks if Israel agrees to a halt in settlement
construction and accepts a Palestinian state in territories seized in the 1967 Middle East war, the West Bank, Gaza, and
east Jerusalem. He first wants progress in the current U.S. mediated indirect talks.

FYI, I am forwarding you a message I just sent to Raj about the article in today's Washington Post.
He and I agreed to work closely on this issue. I have asked INR to get us some research on the security issue which the
implementing partners frequently raise Note the comment in the
Post about the security situation.
As you know we are moving forward on the broader branding issue and plan to have a team of experts advise us as we
move forward.
I will keep you posted.

MOSCOW (RIA Novosti) — Russia is grateful to the United States over the assistance in tackling the wildfires raging across
the country, Russian Foreign Ministry said. U.S. President Barack Obama made a phone call to his Russian counterpart
Dmitry Medvedev August 13 to express his condolences about the disastrous environmental situation in Central Russia
and the readiness to supply firefighting equipment. The United States sent to Russia two planes August 13 with state-of-
the-art nonflammable uniform for firefighters, special shoes, helmets and glasses onboard. Additional two aircraft with
firefighting equipment are expected to arrive.

ExxonMobil's senior management had just informed Kosmos/Blackstone that they were exercising a clause in the
Kosmos-ExxonMobil sales agreement to cancel the deal. Kosmos was stunned by the decision, but thinks ExxonMobil's
position to withdraw is firm and likely irreversible.
Kosmos is preparing a press statement to be issued tomorrow. ExxonMobil would probably inform me
of their decision tonight or tomorrow morning. (As soon as we see the press releases, we will forward them to you.) If I
have not heard anything from Exxon by mid morning Tuesday, I will reach out to Sim Moats.

what others were doing, and I said I'd get back to her. Answer is below. Could you pls pass
this info along? Thanks.
Eleven European countries (France, Italy, Germany, Poland, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Turkey,
Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus and Latvia) have supplied firefighters (515 total currently in
Russia) and heavy firefighting equipment (fire trucks, mobile pumping stations, bulldozers
etc.), three airplanes and six helicopters. Italy and France are providing the fire fighting
aircraft. The European Commission has offered to transport affected children to EU states or
non-affected areas of Russia for treatment of respiratory illnesses. It has also provided masks,
water, health assistance, and general non-food items. China has provided $4m total in cash and
relief supplies so far. NATO offered to help but Moscow was uninterested.
U.S. assistance totals $4.5m, including $3.5m in specialized firefighting equipment, $350k in
planned capacity building, and $50k in humanitarian assistance (bedding, food parcels). Russia
has publicly thanked the U.S. for its assistance.

Subject: talk with Qureshi
I just spoke at length with Qureshi--he had just checked into his hotel. Some of what he said may be useful for
Secretary's speech, others are generally
instructive:
1- He has a 3.5 minute curtain raiser comment planned about what has happened followed by a five minute
"documentary" on the floods that they plan to distribute as CDs.
2-The flood is the biggest since 1929 (almost two decades before Pakistan was
born)
3-The Monsoon season will last another 3-4 weeks, and if rains continue things will get a lot worse. He says we are only
witnessing the effects of the first flood wave, the second is about to happen, and they are expecting a third wave before
the end of the monsoon. The current flood is largely caused by the swelling of Kabul and Indus rivers, the next waves will
include the major rivers running from India through Azad Kashmir and Punjab into Sind. The pressure is already building
in Indian dams and soon they have to release the water.
Pakistan is talking to India, but there is little India can do about the issue.
Flooding in eastern rivers will engulf Baluchistan and Punja as well, more agricultural lands, creating more refugees and
forcing the first wave of refugees to move again.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771090 Date: 08/31/2015
4-The greatest damage is done in the two areas of the country where the security problem is worst: Khyber-
Pakhtunkhwa and Southern Punjab. Devastation is not just by the water but also by the refugee problem (major issue in
Punjab and Baluchistan). As a result tents and refugee relief is the most needed follow up to helicopter support. The
problem in these areas will impact fight against extremism, but he said that exodus to larger cities, and dryer rural
districts is bound to cause a variety of other social and political problems.
5-The Pakistan government was caught by surprise by the magnitude of the problem, especially at local level. Local
authorities in may cases were busy evacuating their own families, and then were overwhelmed by the size of the
problem. The only functioning effort was by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) that was created as
part of 2005 earthquake relief, and is led by General Nadim (working closely with ODRO). But Qureshi says that while
NDMA functions well at national level, at local level it lacks capacity.
6-The largest challenge is complete collapse of local government (the level at which implementation is and will have to
happen. And this involves not just PPP, but PMLN and MQM and ANP as well. As a result, the flood has created interest
in cooperation between all political parties, since local governments of all of them are lacking and face protest.
7-In Islamabad Gilani is in charge, but in effect the army has stepped in to fill the vaccuum for lack of local government.
But even the army is not up to the task.
8-Because of collapse of local government and infrastructure, helicopters were the single most important thing, and
there the US contribution was singularly important.
9-He said friend and foe in Pakistan praises what US has done. The eprception is that the US was first out of gate to help
Pakistan. What has impressed Pakistanis is not just the assistance, but what US officials have said publicly, and the very
visible compassion they have shown for Pakistan. He singled out Ambassador Holbrooke's passionate plea for assistance
to Pakistan as having made an important impact.
10-Qureshi said he is deeply worried that the international community may not understand that the worst is yet to
come, not just floods but what comes after.
He said: Pakistan will have tom revise its budget, its cotton exports are gone and it will ahve to import food it once
produced to feed its own. It will have to invest hugely in infrastructure and rural development, He said the "economic
future is bleak" and if "we don't act quickly the consequences will be disasterous". Pakistan he said needs immediate
relief, but also investment in capacity building and reconstruction.
11-He is considering skipping DC this trip (to be confirmed), and organizing a separate trip there later that would include
visit to the Hill and doing the think tank round.

Subject: Problem: Bustan Plan
The Jerusalem city council is set to review the Kings Garden/Gan Hamelech/Bustan plan tomorrow. Recall that the plan
received approval by a municipal sub committee in late June. The entire city council must now review and approve the
plan because of an administrative appeal filed against it by a Meretz city council member (this appeal process requires
that the entire city council review the plan at some point.) Lots of other details here that Jerusalem will be including in a
front channel cable. Amanda Pilz, CCed here, drafted.
Bottom line though is that (1) this is on the agenda at the explicit direction of the Mayor and deputy mayor and (2)
there is no statutory or other need for this review tomorrow.
Also note that this is not the final step in the process. After full Jerusalem municipal approval the plan must go to
Ministry of Interior bodies. So there is a whole lot of theater involved in this.
Lastly, recall that the Gan Hamelech plan involves extensive demolitions and the redevelopment of Bustan, a section of
the Silwan which is a stone throw away from the Old City. (When S made her comments on demolition in November
2009 she was referring to Bustan demolitions)

DAHIAT AL-BARID (AP) - The Palestinian prime minister has staked a new claim in Israel-controlled east Jerusalem,
announcing that his government has helped fund the renovation of 14 schools there.
Israel said it will not give up any part of Jerusalem, including the eastern sector, which it captured in 1967. The
Palestinians want to make east Jerusalem their future capital.
The Israeli government has tried to suppress any activity by Prime Minister Fayyad's Palestinian Authority in east
Jerusalem and has warned him against entering Jerusalem on November 2 to make the announcement about the
renovations.
Fayyad avoided confrontation and chose a West Bank school on the edge of Jerusalem. The West Bank government
has spent more than $5 million on the renovations.

Vali--per your query, the cap I wore says "USAID from the People of the United States" and on the back "DART". It was
practically the only sign, however temporary, that there was a US civilian effort in Sindh. So it got some media attention,
which was good.
Every other country's aid here, even Iran's, is better branded than us. Only our helicopters are visible. China's field
hospital (which I drove by in Thatta) Turkey, Saudi Arabia (I visited their refugee camp, where they are building a
mosque), Australia (field hospital in multan), Switzerland, UK, etc. While we hide and the NGO partners refuse to admit
that we fund them.
In addition, our employees are prevented from spending time in the affected areas, which they can visit only under very

Omani minister discusses talks to release hiker From Nic Robertson, CNN
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Negotiators had easy access to Obama, Ahmadinejad The talks stalled after five months An Iranian nuclear scientist
caused "disturbance" in July The hikers have been held more than a year
(CNN) -- President Barack Obama had a key role during negotiations between the Omanis and Iranians that led to the
release of an American hiker detained after she and two companions allegedly strayed across an unmarked border
between Iraq and Iran.
Yusuf bin Alawai bin Abdullah, Oman's minister responsible for foreign affairs, told CNN that "indecision and confusion"
at the White House at times delayed the talks -- which began eight months ago when the United States requested
assistance securing the release of Sarah Shourd, Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal.
"The White House was confused because it was working on several different tracks at the same time," he said in a
telephone interview. There were delays "due to the White House administration."
But it was Obama who cleared up any problems, bin Alawai said. It was "easy for us to talk directly to the president," he
said.
The Omanis also dealt with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, saying that negotiators enjoyed good access to
both leaders.
The talks "stalled" after only three months. But Omanis helped facilitate a visit from the hikers' families to Tehran.
Talks began again only because of concerns about Shourd's health, the minister said. A spokeswoman for the hikers'
families told CNN that Shourd told her mother during their only visit together that she had found a lump in her breast.
Shourd, 32, was released from Tehran's Evin Prison and traveled to Oman on Tuesday. Omani sources paid a $500,000
bail, a senior U.S. administration official said.
Bin Alawai said that Shourd is "in good form and good health" in Oman. There is nothing to stop her "enjoying her life in
the U.S.," he said, but she is welcome to stay in Oman as long as she likes.
"There is no pressure on her to leave," he said.
Bin Alawai would not say who paid Shourd's bail.
"I don't want to talk about that" because it might be of "help in the future," he said. He did say, however, that it was a
"legal process" that had some "small" problems that were quickly overcome but led to a short delay in the announced
release.
Administration officials were somewhat confused over how to deal with the Iranians on some of the issues that came
up, the minister said, particularly in July when Iranian nuclear scientist Shahram Amiri appeared at the Iranian interests
section of the Pakistani Embassy in Washington demanding a ticket to Tehran.
"It caused a disturbance at the White House," bin Alawai said.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771240 Date: 08/31/2015
U.S. officials said Amiri defected to the United States in 2009 and provided information about Iran's alleged nuclear
weapons program. Iran maintains he was abducted by U.S. agents in Saudi Arabia. Despite the "disturbance," bin Alawai
said, the idea of an exchange of Amiri for the hikers surfaced.
"The Iranians were ready to think about an exchange," he said, but at the White House "not everyone was on board at
that time."
Bin Alawai avoided saying that Shourd's release was part of an exchange, but allowed that "it may have helped" that
Amiri eventually returned to Iran.
Iran has accused the three hikers of spying, but no charges have been filed. Shourd's fiance, Bauer, and Fattal, both 28,
remain at Evin Prison. They were detained on July 31, 2009.

UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The UN says it's making the largest disaster appeal ever, asking the world's governments and
humanitarian groups to raise a total $2 billion for Pakistan's flood victims. Previously, the largest appeal for disaster
relief was the $1.5 billion in aid for victims of the devastating January earthquake in Haiti. The $2 billion appeal
announced on September 17 for Pakistan relief includes the nearly $500 million the UN asked countries and
organizations to donate shortly after the onset of massive flooding nearly two months ago.

Subject: Tony Blair on the American Ideal
Americans can be all that the rest of the world sometimes accuses them of: brash, loud, insular, obsessive and heavy-
handed. But America is great for a reason. It is looked up to, despite all the criticism, for a reason. There is a nobility in
the American character that has been developed over the centuries, derived in part, no doubt, from the frontier spirit,
from the waves of migration that form the stock, from the circumstances of independence, from the Civil War, from a
myriad of historical facts and coincidences. But it is there.
That nobility isn't about being nicer, better or more successful than anyone else. It is a feeling about the country. It is a
devotion to the American ideal that at a certain point transcends class, race, religion or upbringing. That ideal is about
values: freedom, the rule of law, democracy. It is also about the way you achieve: on merit, by your own efforts and
hard work. But it is most of all that in striving for and protecting that ideal, you as an individual take second place to the

interests of the nation as a whole. It is what makes the country determined to overcome its challenges. It is what makes
its soldiers give their lives in sacrifice. It is what brings every variety of American, from the lowest to the highest, to their
feet when "The Star-Spangled Banner" is played. Of course the ideal is not always met — that is obvious. But it is always
striven for.
The Need for American Confidence
The next years will test the American character. America won't be loved in this presidency any more than in previous
ones. But America should have confidence. That ideal, which produces the optimism that generates the achievement, is
worth all the striving. It is the most precious gift a nation can have. The world is changing. New powers are emerging.
But this does not diminish the need for that American ideal. It reaffirms it, renews it, gives it added relevance. There is
always one, more prosaic, test of a nation's position: Are people trying to get into it, or to get out of it? I think we know
the answer to that in America's case, and that ideal is the reason.
A friend of mine whose parents were immigrants, Jews from Europe who came to America in search of safety, told me
this story. His parents lived and worked in New York. They were not well off. His father died when he was young. His
mother lived on, and in time my friend succeeded and became wealthy. He often used to offer his mother the chance to
travel outside America. She never did. When eventually she died, they went back to recover the safety box where she
kept her jewelry. They found there was another box. There was no key. So they had to drill it open. They wondered what
precious jewel must be in it. They lifted the lid. There was wrapping and more wrapping and finally an envelope.
Intrigued, they opened it. In the envelope were her U.S. citizenship papers. Nothing more. That was the jewel, more
precious to her than any other possession. That was what she treasured most. So should America today.

1.4(D)
In the past two months, the TAPI project has been resuscitated, largely due to Turkmen President
Berdimukhamedov's personal outreach to his counterparts in Kabul, Islamabad and New Delhi. A "Heads of
Agreement" for the project was recently signed, and there is a possibility that the heads of state of the four
participant countries will meet in Ashgabat in December to give further political impetus to the project. As a
result, the Asian Development Bank, has now
reengaged on the project, and has just agreed to fund technical assistance to the Afghan Ministry of Mines to
assist in negotiations with the other TAPI partners.
I have met twice with Turkmen President Berdimukhamedov since August, and TAPI is at the top of his
agenda.
We all recognize the significant hurdles that TAPI faces, both from a security and commercial standpoint,
but we believe we should do what we can to encourage forward movement on the project:
I have also made General
Petraeus aware of the above.

It was only a little over a year and a half ago that the Obama administration demanded a freeze on Israeli
settlements in the occupied territories, including even the "natural growth" of existing settlements. At the time,
the administration called settlement activity "illegitimate" and appeared ready to go to the mat with Israel to
show just how strongly the United States believed that settlements impede peace.
But now, the administration says it is prepared to pay off Israel to freeze only some of its settlement activity,
and only temporarily. For the first time in memory, the United States is poised to reward Israel for its bad
behavior.
Here's the offer that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is reported to have put on the table recently: The
United States will provide a package of advanced weaponry and military assistance to Israel totaling several
billion dollars, all in return for an Israeli commitment to freeze settlement construction for just three months,
excluding construction in Jerusalem. During this period, the United States hopes Israel and the Palestinian
Authority will negotiate an agreement on the final borders of a future Palestinian state. The Israeli cabinet is
weighing the offer, having demanded a letter from Washington confirming the terms.
This is a very bad idea. And while Washington will almost certainly come to regret bribing Israel, Israel may
regret receiving such a bribe even more.

Previously, U.S. opposition to settlements resulted in penalties, not rewards, for continued construction.
Washington deducted from its loan guarantees to Israel an amount equivalent, dollar for dollar, to the money
that Israel spent in the occupied territories. While it's true that the United States has turned a blind eye to
indirect U.S. subsidies for Israeli activities in the territories - such as tax deductions for American organizations
that fund settlements - the deal now being offered to Israel is of a totally different magnitude. If it goes forward,
it will be the first direct benefit that the United States has provided Israel for settlement activities that we have
opposed for more than 40 years.
It is not clear that Washington has thought through the implications. Will the United States similarly reward
Palestinians for stopping their own bad behavior? Will Washington pay them to, say, halt the incitement against
Israel and Jews in their public media and some educational materials - something that shouldn't have been going
on in the first place? Will the rewards for Israel be automatically renewable? Meaning, if Israel is willing to
continue the settlement freeze after three months, will another set of rewards be the price for that? And what
about enforcement? Will the United States demand its money back if it learns about construction during the
freeze, even if that construction was not authorized by the Israeli government?
The list of problems is so long that it would not be surprising if the administration were already experiencing
buyer's remorse.
But the arrangement has an even more serious long-term implication, one that should worry Israel profoundly.
If it goes through, this deal will shake the foundation of the U.S.-Israeli strategic partnership. Since the early
1980s, the two countries have cooperated closely on assessing Israeli security, and Washington has promised to
ensure Israel's "qualitative military edge" over any combination of potential Arab adversaries.
This commitment has been insulated from the vicissitudes of politics and diplomacy. Whatever the state of
U.S.-Israeli relations or the peace process, America's commitment to Israel's security has been manifest. Not so,
if this deal materializes. By subjecting Israel's defense needs to the political demands of an American
administration, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has done something quite dangerous for Israel - he has
made those needs contingent, negotiable, optional. Israel's security requirements are now merely a bargaining
chip with which to negotiate what Jerusalem will or will not do to advance the peace process.
Today, the United States has "purchased" a short-term settlements freeze; what will be for sale tomorrow?
Conversely, how seriously should our defense planners and congressional budget watchers take Israel's
arguments about its security needs when it is prepared to market different elements of its policy for another
squadron of advanced aircraft? Does anyone really believe that there is a substantive connection between a
three-month settlement freeze and Israel's professed need for more airplanes?
These short-sighted tactics will lead both the United States and Israel into a long-term bind. Washington will be
left fending off a landslide of demands from others who hope to be rewarded for their bad behavior, to be paid
for stopping what they should never have been doing. Israel, meanwhile, will be left struggling to explain how
precious its settlements really are if a payoff - albeit a high one - is enough to see them frozen. And both
countries will need a new rationale for the exceedingly high price of what Israel calls its security requirements,
but which will now look more like poker chips used to secure American aid.
This bargaining exercise has been unseemly all along; if it proceeds, both sides will probably regret it. But the
deal has not yet been sealed. And it is not too late to start over.

Subject: (Jerusalem Post) PM: Cabinet to review US freeze deal when we get letter
(Jerusalem Post) Prime Minister Netanyahu met with Likud MKs and deputy ministers to discuss the U.S.
proposal for a 90-day construction freeze, November 21. In the meeting, Netanyahu told the Likud officials: "I
have a responsibility that includes making the best decision for the state of Israel and its national interests,
foremost, its security." He continued, 'We still haven't received the written agreement from the Americans on
the basic understandings." The prime minister assured those attending the meeting, "If we receive a written
agreement, I will bring it to the cabinet and I am sure that the ministers will approve it because it is what's best
for the state of Israel." He added, "If we don't receive such a document, I won't bring the issue [of a freeze] to
the cabinet."
Earlier in the day thousands of settlers protested outside the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem against the
potential freeze. National Infrastructures Minister Uzi Landau, an opponent of an additional freeze, addressed
the demonstrators. Dozens of youngsters also blocked the entrance to Jerusalem. Police dispersed the
protesters and arrested two people. Over the weekend, Kadima MK Avi Dichter told The Jerusalem Post, "The
total freeze for 10 months was a serious mistake," said Dichter. "It was clear that it would come to an end, and
that in those 10 months nothing dramatic could happen between Israel and the Palestinians — leaving us in the
same situation as at the beginning."
"Netanyahu made a second mistake when he didn't agree to the American request to extend a two-month
freeze immediately on September 26, and insist that it was the last freeze. If he had, we'd be one week away
from the end, rather than in our current state," he said. Dichter said the "main problem is that the topic of the
freeze has become the central topic of discussion, rather than talks between us and the Palestinians.

Subject: If bilateral talks fail, a regional approach
For your Sunday reading, a summary of an interesting proposal by former Jordanian foreign minister Marwan Muasher.
"Palestinian-Israeli Direct Talks: The Case for a Regional Approach"By Marwan Muasher (Carnegie Endowment Bulletin,
August 2010)
Marwan Muasher – former Jordanian foreign minister, ambassador, and deputy prime minister – advocates a regional
settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, capitalizing on the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative. His approach depends first
on securing end-game "deposits" from all parties: The parties would offer hypothetical commitments that they might
not be willing to give at the onset, but that can be "deposited" with the U.S. and committed to only if the other side is
willing to do the same. Saudi Arabia's deposit, for instance, would outline and agree to a package that included details
about Jerusalem. The Saudi package would also promise to secure Arab and Muslim backing for the painful compromises
the Palestinians would need to accept.
Muasher advocates a similar approach to the Syrian track—asking Syria to deposit end-game commitments in return for
full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. In their deposits, the Saudis and the Syrians must clearly commit to
address the inclusion of Hamas and Hezbollah in any regional agreement. The Arab states would not only have to end all
logistical, financial, and military support for these two groups, but they would have to assume responsibility for
delivering these two actors, helping to transform them into political players. Israel's deposit would spell out its
commitment to a solution based on 1967 borders and a return of the Golan.
According to Muasher, these deposits would make it much easier for President Abbas to engage in talks aimed at ending
the conflict. After he has been given Arab cover, Abbas could provide his own end-game deposits. According to
Muasher, absent these commitments from the Arab states, the Palestinian positions will remain maximalist. Once the
U.S. has deposits from all sides that make for a reasonable, comprehensive package, it should put this package on the
table in cooperation with the Quartet. Once the comprehensive package is presented, the U.S. can focus on confidence-
building measures to move all sides toward the end game.

that's for the Iraqis to decide.
There may be other ways to have a gov't. But this should happen soon. Where we would have concerns: if the Sadrists
end up with the power to veto gov't decisions or to topple the gov't.

Hearing from some sources that Anwar Ibrahim has linked to AQ financiers. Apparently the Saudis are onto this and
showed the US a dossier about this. Do you know anything about it? Is this the real reason why her meeting with him

Here is the latest from Lissa, Jake, and me (I took over from Lissa this morning because her son is winning all his soccer
matches somewhere.in Pennsylvania). We still have a bunch of things to add (as you will see in yellow), but this is
definitely ready for you to engage. I think it will make a real impact, and it fits Jim Hoge's desire not just to make this a
report card on the QDDR but to advance some bigger animating ideas.
Some questions:
I hope this is a read that improves your vacation mood rather than detracting from it!

Subject: Parliamentary Election Update
On Wednesday, the IEC certifies the final results for 34 out of 35 constituencies in the Parliamentary Elections. The Chairperson of
the IEC noted that while results for Ghazni elections were not included in the final results due to "technical issues," they would be
announced in the upcoming three to five days. The UN and US embassy issued statements welcoming the results and commending the
work of the IEC and ECC. While the Palace has not made any public comments, the Attorney General's office—which has served as
the Government's mouthpiece to challenge the election institutions—continues to question the election outcome, criticizing the UN
for endorsing the results and vowing that it will continue to investigate allegations of corruption and fraud in the IEC and ECC. In a
last minute effort to influence the election announcement, the Attorney General had called for the suspension of the IEC and ECC
spokesmen. The embassy has reported that the IEC and ECC have dismissed the Attorney General's comments as political posturing
intended to influence the outcome in Ghazni.
Demonstrations have been taking place in various parts of the country are likely to grow, given the Attorney General's comments. The
political leadership appears to be split along ethnic lines, with a number of prominent Hazara and Tajik leaders—including Amrullah
Saleh and Abdullah Abdullah—insisting that the election results in all 34 provinces being upheld, while Pashtun leaders—including
Ashraf Ghani—questioning the legitimacy of the election results in a number of provinces. The President has noted that he will confer
with his two Vice Presidents and jihadi leaders before commenting on the results. Vice President Khalili has been the key Hazara
leader working with the UN to broker a deal to resolve the Ghazni elections.

look at what I've done. I've flagged a few things I think should change. With one more pass by you, and a few more
adjustments by us, I think this is good to go for Monday.

Subject: Update
-The damage to Kabul Bank's credibility appears to be irreparable. Thousands of people are lining up at Kabul
Bank branches throughout the country to withdraw funds. While the situation is still orderly, there is mounting
frustration--particularly in the provinces-- that the bank is unable to give people back their full deposits, forcing
them to repeatedly return and stand in long lines to withdraw their money in increments. On Saturday close to
70 million dollars was withdrawn. Hajis (people who have provided funds to go to Haj) are also demanding
their money bank. The overall sense is that it is a matter of days before the government will be forced to take
over KB.
-There are also reports of security people employed at KB shaking people withdrawing money. The government
has responded by replacing KB security with ANSF and NDS guards.
-On a positive note, the adverse situation in KB bank has not affected the other banks. The majority of people
withdrawing funds from KB are opening new accounts in Afghan International Bank, Aziz Bank, among others.
The heads of these banks have successfully projected corruption at KB as something that is associated with the
leadership of KB rather than a more systematic problem affecting other banks. People are also turning to other
banks because the security situation leaves them worried about keeping their savings at home.
-In the very short run, the government has come out ahead in this crisis. People are reassured that President
Karzai has actively taken control of the situation and is showing leadership. But this is clearly the biggest crisis
that President Karzai has faced in the last nine years. A number of the political elite are privately noting that the
situation could escalate and people could turn against the government once they feel the effects of this crisis.
Corruption, which President Karzai has cast a western concern, is now seen by Afghans as a fundamental
problem within the government.
-While the majority of media outlets have been cautious to not criticize the Government, fearing that it could
lead to further instability, this is expected to change in the coming days. Abdullah Abdullah has been one of the
few voices that has come out and noted that the Government was an active agent in the KB scandal, pointing
out in a press conference today that government cronyism was a big factor in this crisis and noting that no steps

have been taken to hold accountable those who illegally gambled with people's money. GIRoA is expected to
come increasingly under such criticism as further evidence of government negligence and complicity
becomes publicly known.
-Perhaps in an effort to deflect attention from this issue, the Government announced yesterday that the the High
Peace Council will be established after Eid. Jihadi leaders such as Rabbani, Mujaddidi, Sayyaf are expected to
feature prominently in the body. Women are expected to comprise 20% or 30% of the 50-60 council.

Depending of course on how the meeting goes today, we think it would be very good if the Secretary could attend the
VP meeting tomorrow to make sure that the hard questions about where we are on Iraq government formation are
addressed.
The Secretary uniquely brings the ability to express her instincts on where this process is going (or not going) and she
brings the understanding of the whole region that we must take into account as we push for an Iraqi government. Her
understanding of where we are on the Peace Process, our credibility with the full range of Arab leaders, and our
relationship with Iran, are subjects she can put on the table and make sure are comprehensively considered before any
decisions on a way forward are reached.

Dear Ambassador Kim,
Since I haven't heard from you I assume my trip to North Korea is okay with you guys. My plan is to
leave Monday, December 13th, stay for 2 days and return to the United States on the weekend.
The North Koreans have assured me that they will not exploit my visit and that they have some positive
messages to convey. They know that I am not an envoy of the administration and that is fine with them.
My sense is that they will with draw the invitation if I postpone once again at your request.
Needless to say, the Obama administration wishes will be an important factor to me as I pursue this trip.
All the best — Bill Richardson

Subject: State Debt Problems Mount
Hi Jake,
This does not have a direct foreign policy bearing, but I think S would be interested — because it is an enormous and
growing problem. These stats come from a NYT Op-Ed piece:
• Over 20% of California's debt issuance during 2009 and over 30% of its debt issuance in 2010 to date has been
subsidized by the federal government in a program known as Build America Bonds. Under the program, the U.S.
Treasury covers 35% of the interest paid by the bonds. Arguably, without this program the interest cost of bonds
for some states would have reached prohibitive levels.
• "California is not alone: Over 30% of Illinois's debt and over 40% of Nevada's debt issued since 2009 has also
been subsidized with these bonds. These states might have already reached some type of tipping point had the
federal program not been in place."
• "Today, more than 28% of state funding comes from federal government transfers, the highest contribution on
record. These transfers have made states dependent on federal assistance. New York, for example, spent in
excess of 250% of its tax receipts over the last decade. The largest 15 states by GDP spent on average over 220%
of their tax receipts. Clearly, states have been spending at unsustainable levels without facing immediate
consequences due to federal transfer payments and other temporary factors."

Subject: G-20 Communiqué Preview for S
Jake —
Here is an update for the Secretary on the status of the non-finance components of the G-20 Seoul Summit
declaration. Sherpa, Finance Deputy, and Working Group discussions are ongoing on the financial issues (and
the text is very close hold) — so we don't have much on that. The following represents what is likely to be close
to the final outcome on the other issues.
• Fossil Fuel Subsidies: The text will reaffirm the Pittsburgh Summit commitment to phase out over the
medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. It will also take up the issue of fuel price volatility; this
portion will focus on improving the quality of fuel data (inventories, storage capacity, refining, etc.) and
greater dialogue between fuel producers and consumers.
• Climate Change: The G-20 will rededicate their efforts to discuss climate change issues under the
UNFCCC process with the aim of reaching a global and comprehensive framework post 2012. The text
will also focus on the upcoming COP16 conference in Mexico.
• Trade: The G-20 will continue to collectively push for the conclusion of the Doha Round, calling for
intensified engagement in 2011.
• Development: The Communiqué will contain a multi-year development action plan that focuses on nine
pillars: infrastructure, human resource development, trade, private investment and job creation, food
security, financial inclusion, fiscal integrity and domestic resource mobilization, and "growth with
resilience."
• Anti-Corruption: The G-20 will endorse an Anti-Corruption Action Plan to spur action under the UN
Convention Against Corruption; address transnational bribery; deny corrupt persons access to the global
financial system; and further engage the private sector.
I will be happy to provide more details on any one of these items if the Secretary would like — and will report
on the discussions and final outcome.

No real harm, other than taking up your time. But no real upside either. Over the last decade you've only spoken to one

saying no to all. Doesn't make it a wise policy, but it's been SOP.

My requests for a book interview with the secretary

the reason is sheer bureaucracy (lots of requests)

that the ISI was "looking for" Both wife and a colleague in our Islamabad Bureau, have had

I understand that the State Department's influence with ISI is limited at best, but I wanted to get this situation on the
department's radar, and urge you to take any steps you can think of to discourage this menacing treatment of an
honorable and talented journalist, so that he can return to Pakistan and his work without fear.

Special investigation: How Blair rescued Palestine
deal worth $200m to his Um-a-year paymasters
By David Rose
Last updated at 12:42 AM on 12th September 2010
Tony Blair mounted an intense political lobbying campaign to rescue a struggling mobile-phone business owned by a client of the bank
that pays him a £2 million annual salary.
The firm, Wataniya, had already built a brand-new network in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian West Bank. But it almost collapsed before
launching its service, jeopardising a £450 million investment, because Israel's government was refusing to let it use the frequencies it
needed to operate. Acting in his capacity as the international Middle East peace envoy, Mr Blair helped to save the company by
spending months putting pressure on Israel's prime minister and his colleagues in a bid to change their minds.
An investigation by The Mail on Sunday has revealed:
• Mr Blair spoke of the need to get Wataniya up and running in order to boost the Palestinian economy. However JP Morgan,
the American investment bank that employs him as a consultant, has a financial stake in Wataniya through Wataniya's owner,
the Qatari firm Qtel, which is an important client of JP Morgan.
• Financial documents show that back in 2007, JP Morgan had been one of four 'mandated lead arrangers' of a $2 billion loan
with which Qtel bought Wataniya from its original Kuwaiti owners. Last year, the bank joined a syndicate that lent Qtel a further
$500 million, and became a 'lead arranger' for a Qtel bond issue which raised yet another $1.5billion.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772350 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772350 Date: 08/31/2015
In these deals, JP Morgan would have been paid many millions of pounds in fees, and if the loans had gone bad, could have been
exposed to substantial losses. 'Its original exposure was probably around $200 million,' one Wall Street expert said yesterday.
Last night a bank spokesman refused to comment, or to disclose any further details. He did not deny that Qtel was a significant JP
Morgan client. A spokesman for Mr Blair said he had no knowledge of any connection between JP Morgan and Qtel.
Mr Blair's lobbying campaign also helped to enrich the family of the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas — a central figure
in the search for Middle East peace. A firm run by his son Tarek has secured a lucrative contract to provide advertising for
Wataniya. Mr Blair's envoy role — for which, as he has often boasted, he is not paid
a salary — has now been enhanced.
Earlier this month, Mr Abbas, Mr Blair and the most important man he lobbied, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, sat down
together in Washington with President Obama to begin new direct peace talks.
Last night Mr Blair faced calls to publish full details of the myriad business interests that have netted him a personal fortune estimated
to be at least £15 million since he left office.
He is paid not only by JP Morgan but also by the insurance giant Zurich, and his own private consulting firm, Tony Blair Associates,
counts among its clients the royal families of Abu Dhabi and Kuwait.
A frequent visitor to Libya, he has used his personal friendship with the dictator Colonel Gaddafi to explore business opportunities there
on behalf of JP Morgan.
David Davis, the senior backbench Tory MP, said: 'There are now clear questions about how he has used his powers as a peace envoy
and whether that has benefited his commercial sponsors.
'He must now put all his financial affairs into the public domain. Only then can we be sure he has behaved in an appropriate manner.'
Mr Blair was appointed an envoy on leaving Downing Street in June 2007. He represents the 'Quartet' — the United Nations, the US, the
EU and Russia.
His special area of responsibility is the Palestinian economy.
With ten rooms permanently booked at Jerusalem's most expensive hotel, the American Colony, at an annual cost of £1.1 million, he
spends a few days there each month.
As The Mail on Sunday reported last year, many Palestinian businessmen say his achievements have been limited. Projects he has
loudly supported — such as an international business park near the holy city of Hebron — have come to nothing.
'But Wataniya is the great exception,' one leading West Bank entrepeneur said yesterday. 'Indeed, until he finally managed to sort it out
at the end of last year, it was difficult to get him to engage with anything else.'
When Mr Blair arrived in the Middle East in 2007, there was only one mobile firm, Jawwal, operating in the Palestinian Occupied
Territories, Gaza and the West Bank. But Wataniya had already purchased licences for £313 million from Mr Abbas's Palestinian
Authority to provide a competing service.
In July 2008, Mr Blair brokered what Wataniya thought was a cast-iron deal with Israel to make the frequencies it needed available. In
order to provide a modern 3G service to include mobile intemet, Wataniya had been seeking a bandwidth of 4.8 megahertz.
On the strength of this agreement, it continued to build mobile-phone masts, switching centres and other installations it needed to
operate, spending a further £100 million.
It was set to launch in June last year. Meanwhile, amid fierce local controversy, Wataniya managed to secure special additional loans
from a US government programme that had been set up to help Palestinian farmers and small businesses — despite the backing it had
from Qtel and, indirectly, banks such as JP Morgan.
Launching this programme in 2007, the State Department said it was aimed at 'an olive grower who wants to expand operations, a
young person with a small information technology company, or someone who wants to hire neighbours to produce and export
Palestinian embroidery' — not a £450 million mobile network.
The US loans to Wataniya, though worth a relatively modest £11 million, deprived other enterprises of them.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772350 Date: 08/31/2015
Critics pointed to the fact that involved with Wataniya were leading members of the Palestinian elite around Mr Abbas. Its Palestine
chairman is Mohammad Mustafa — his financial adviser and closest associate, who accompanies him on virtually every foreign trip.
'In the meetings he had with the Prime Minister, he brought it up time
and time again, and kept pushing, pushing.'
In the late spring of 2009, Mr Blair's frequency deal unravelled. Claiming.that the Palestinian Authority had failed to fulfil unspecified
commitments, Israel refused to release the necessary bandwidth. Wataniya teetered on the brink of collapse as first the June and then
a second October launch date, came and went, with the network still inoperative.
Alan Richardson, a Scottish engineer who had already set up a mobile network in Iraq, was Wataniya's Palestine chief executive until
June this year.
'We invested according to a business plan that was based on false promises,' he told me last October. We cannot meet our subscriber
targets with the frequencies they are offering.'
However, Mr Blair was furiously trying to rescue the company. 'From day one of this problem, he's been very proactive through his role
as Quartet representative,' Mr Richardson said.
A senior Israeli official said last week: 'In the meetings he had with the Prime Minister, he brought it up time and time again, and kept
pushing, pushing.'
One reason the Israelis advanced for not releasing the bandwidth was security — claiming it needed the frequencies for military
communications. Another Israeli source confirmed that Mr Blair repeatedly raised the matter in meetings with Israel's defence minister,
Ehud Barak.
Mr Blair made several public statements about the Wataniya frequency dispute, and did not mention JP Morgan at all.
'If we cannot get the proper frequency and it cannot go forward then we don't have proper competition on mobile telephony and we
don't get the investment and jobs,' he said after the first launch was cancelled in June 2009.
'It may seem a small thing in one sense but it's very important for the Palestinian economy.'
Finally, after Qtel threatened legal action, Mr Blair got his way. Although Israel agreed to release only 3.8 megahertz at first, local
sources say it has promised to expand this to 4.8 megahertz once Wataniya has 350,000 customers.
Wataniya launched on November 10, with Mr Blair at the opening ceremony. He said it proved that 'Palestine is open for business'.
Earlier this year, Mr Blair singled out the affair in a report he wrote on his envoy work to the Commons' Foreign Affairs Committee.
'Wataniya's launch is overdue, but extremely welcome,' he wrote, '[it] means the completion of a key milestone in the economic reform
and state building agenda ...Wataniya is an example of a flagship project, which has a significant impact on people's perceptions and
hopes for what a lasting peace might bring.'
Yesterday The Mail on Sunday asked Mr Blair's spokesman Matthew Doyle whether he had declared the bank's interest in his meetings
with the Israelis.
He replied in an email, saying only: 'Tony Blair raised Wataniya at the request of the Palestinian Authority in his role as Quartet
Representative. He has no knowledge of any connection between QTel and JP Morgan and has never discussed the issue with JP
Morgan nor have they ever raised it with him. Any suggestion that he raised it for any reason other than the one stated to help the
Palestinians or that in some way he has benefited from Wataniya is untrue and defamatory.'
Critics Of the Wataniya mobile- phone project backed so strongly by Tony Blair claim it is marred by a longstanding feature of the
Palestinian scene — cronyism, in which close associates of the ruling Fatah party leadership somehow manage to derive lucrative
benefits.
In the case of Wataniya, the link could hardly be closer — for one big beneficiary of the firm's investments is none other than Tarek
Abbas, the son of the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas.
American-educated Tarek runs Sky, the West Bank's biggest advertising agency. Last year, it was awarded a contract to be Wataniya's
lead advertising agent, with both a monthly retainer and further payments for individual campaigns.

Palestinian business sources say that its work for Wataniya has been worth approximately £700,000 in the past 12 months — almost
certainly, the biggest advertising 'spend' in Palestine.
Meanwhile, businessman Firas Nasruddin, a friend of both Tarek and his father, owns Hemaya, a security company staffed by men in
sunglasses and black uniforms, some of whom are former fighters against Israel in groups such as the AI-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades.
Others are former Palestinian Authority police.
Hemaya has a contract to provide security for Wataniya personnel and installations.
It also serves several other firms that are supported by the Palestine Investment Fund, a large pot of money that is meant to be used to
benefit the Palestinian people.
The fund has a 43 per cent stake in Wataniya. President Abbas's chief adviser Mohammad Mustafa is chairman and CEO of the fund,
and chairman of Wataniya.
Wataniya's spokesman, Mohammad Nasser said last night he could not answer any questions about how the Sky and Hemaya
contracts were awarded until next week, while Tarek Abbas's lawyer — who usually speaks on his behalf — could not be reached.
In an interview last year, Wataniya's former Palestine chief, Scot Alan Richardson, said there had been 'a straightforward contract
process that went through all the normal procedures', adding that Sky and Hemaya had been given their deals because they
represented 'best price, best quality'.
Wataniya, he said, operated in a 'fair and transparent manner'.
Nevertheless, the outcome means that as Tony Blair takes part in the renewed search for a peace deal, both sides will know that his
support for Wataniya has produced sizeable benefits for President Abbas's family and friends.

First-Ever NHL-CHL Exhibition Game Helps Break International Ice in St. Petersburg: Thanks to U/S
Judith McHale who brought National Hockey League VP Ken Yaffe to Moscow under the auspices of the U.S.-
Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission for an icebreaker with Continental Hockey League representatives, St.
Petersburg's beloved SKA hockey team hosted the Carolina Hurricanes for an exhilarating exhibition game at
the Ice Palace. From the opening ceremony featuring both the U.S. and Russian national anthems, the capacity
crowd of 4,500 — including St. Petersburg Governor Valentina Matviyenko, SKA owner and Gazprom
Chairman Alexey Miller, Hurricanes owner and Compuware Corporation CEO Peter Karmanos, Jr., and U.S.
Consul General Sheila Gwaltney — cheered the two teams on. The heart-pounding, high-scoring game included
dazzling play by the 'Canes Eric Staal and Jeff Skinner (Carolina's game MVP) plus SKA favorites Alexei
Yashin (SKA's game MVP) and Maksim Sushinski. With Rossiya TV announcing that "we've waited 20 years
for this," SKA broke the second period tie and led their team to a 5-3 victory over the 'Canes in the last
period. SKA's enthusiastic organ player rocked the crowd with themes from "Ghostbusters" and "The Addams
Family" — plus Tina Turner's "Simply the Best" — and helped the Russian crowd give their home team their
traditional electrifying support. Continuing the "sports diplomacy" after the game, dozens of avid Russian
hockey fans waited patiently by the team buses and were elated when 'Canes Goalie Cam Ward signed
autographs and posed for photographs with them. The Russian crowd's enthusiasm for this match as well as
their admiration for the American team were ice-crystal clear from the capacity crowd (the stadium only sells
out for championship matches or games against their arch rival Moscow team), their cheers for the Hurricanes,
plus the extensive media presence, including live nation-wide coverage on Rossiya TV.

It's worth you checking in with him before the meeting. His quick report of meeting with Allawi:
1. Allawi said he pulled back from striking a deal with ISCI because he is concerned that the Shia representation is
too small and there is too much difficulty in trying to widen
2. Allawi asked bill if he thought Maliki was serious, suggesting that he was toying with the idea of a grand coalition
3. Allawi will see Barzani on the 11th
Bill's overall take is that Allawi might now be looking to test the wider coalition proposition and is not as interested in
the ISCI gambit as first option.
Bill has also seen AI-Mahdi Talabani and Zebari. He said there would be a good meeting with Maliki he's obviously
feeling confident, but was firm on limiting role of Sadrists and need to bring Iraqiyya into inclusive govt.

Subject: (Haaretz) Israeli Labor party expects new settlement freeze as payoff for loyalty oath
(Hareetz) Labor party ministers angered by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's snap decision to back a
controversial citizenship loyalty oath said late October 6 that they expected a new freeze in settlement
building as a payoff. Netanyahu neglected to inform his Labor coalition partners that he had approved a
right-wing minister's draft of a new oath that would require anyone taking Israeli citizenship to swear
allegiance to Israel as a "Jewish and democratic state."
The move paves the way for a vote in the Knesset and was hailed as victory by ultra-nationalist Foreign
Minister Avigdor Lieberman's Israel our Home party, Netanyahu's major coalition partner. But the prime
minister must perform a balancing act. Allies at both ends of the political spectrum and the Labor party
hope that his latest concession is a sop to right-wingers ahead of a decision to renew a ban on settlement
building in the West Bank - a key demand of the left.

To follow up - the team tried its hand at a boiled down version of the CFR speech, but in 700 words it lost the nuance
and amounted to a series of generalisms. We felt that a more specific topic would allow for a sharper message. We
selected democracy because it allows you to talk about a broad and relevant trend that cuts across global affairs; to
reprise signature themes like Internet freedom, civil society, and the democracy/development nexus; and to underscore
that this administration takes these issues seriously. This was also an element of your CFR speech and provides some
continuity in that respect as well. We were not looking to break new ground but rather to reinforce.

about America's priorities and place in the world in 2011, ten years after 9/11 and twenty years after the end of the Cold
War. The team (Jake, Josh, Anne-Marie, Derek) felt that this was a good opportunity to pull together for a wide audience
some of the key themes you sounded in Krakow and elsewhere, and build on the President's call to action at UNGA. We
don't say anything new here, its true, but the idea was to lay down another marker that these are issues that are
important to you and to the administration.

BELGRADE (AP) — Serbia's failure to prevent anti-gay riots could hurt its bid to join the European Union, a EU official

riots "show an elementary lack" of tolerance for minority rights in Serbia and the "inefficiency" of the state in preventing
such a trend. "A very bad message was sent from Belgrade" that could hurt its bid to join the EU, the Slovenian official
said. The gay pride march, was viewed as a major test for Serbia's government, which has pledged to protect human
rights as it seeks EU membership.

Cow farming program wins Apps 4 Africa
cornpetition
An application which tracks the fertility of cows has won the first ever Apps 4
Africa competition to find new talent as smartphones become increasingly
popular in Africa.
Offering a prize fund of $5,000, the competition asked developers in Kenya, Uganda,
Rwanda and Tanzania to come up with a mobile application that is widely accessible,
easy to use and simple.
"I want to thank you for lending your innovate spirit and creativity to the enterprise of
building a better future for your communities."
End Quote Hillary Clinton US Secretary of State
The competition, funded by the United States government, hoped to unite the brightest
African developers with people who could benefit most from innovate mobile technology.
Launched back in July in Nairobi, the competition attracted 20 entrants - each offering a
unique approach to improving life in the region.
Moo-bile innovation
The winner, announced this week, was iCow - an application that helps cow farmers
maximise breeding potential by tracking the fertility cycle of their animals.
"It's a voice-based application, meaning they don't have to have a special smart-phone,"
explained Charles Kithika, the app's creator.
"[They] just need an ordinary phone and then dial in a toll-free number."
Mr Kithika said the rise in popularity of mobile apps in Africa is partly down to M-PESA,
software which facilitates the transfer of money.
Runner-up in the competition was Kleptocracy Fighters, an app which helps users
combat instances of government corruption.
Features include the ability to upload audio, video and text to the web quickly - acting as
evidence of bribery or other wrong-doing.

All the competition entrants were praised by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who
said that the apps "solved real problems".
"The ideas generated from this competition will help doctors monitor the growth and
nutrition of young patients, will help expand trade by translating prices and quantities
into local languages, will hold public officials accountable by reporting election violations
and tracking public expenditures.
"I want to thank you for lending your innovative spirit and creativity to the enterprise of
building a better future for your communities."

groups claim advance voting schemes are one indication of significant fraud and vote rigging. End Summary.

Subject: RE: (AP) Israel announces new east Jerusalem housing plans
In addition to the longer chain, you should know that the location of these units is very problematic and would
significantly change the demographic dynamics of the city and the ability to divide it, if we get to the point. Har Homa is
located in southern Jerusalem just north of Bethlehem. The B and C phases of Har Homa will expand the neighborhood
eastward (hotdog shape), going a long ways to cutting off Bethlehem for Jerusalem and the Arab neighborhoods there.

Subject: (AP) Israel announces new east Jerusalem housing plans
JERUSALEM - (AP) Israel says it is moving ahead with plans to build 1,300 new apartments in disputed east
Jerusalem. The Interior Ministry's announcement and its timing could embarrass Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, who is visiting the U.S. Washington is already frustrated over his refusal to curb settlement
construction. Palestinians condemned the plans. They claim east Jerusalem for a future capital. The
government plans to expand the Har Homa neighborhood by 978 apartments and to build 320 new apartments
in the Ramot neighborhood.

Subject: FROM MIKE POSNER - trip report
Jake, Cheryl,
Mike sent this note from Israel, and we will send to S as a note for the Secretary — wanted to give you an
advance copy. Will share with Jeff Feltman and Mara Rudman too.
Regards, Deborah G
NOTE from Mike Posner for the Secretary
Tomorrow, Nov. 11, we are completing a four day visit to Israel. I am accompanied by Colonel (Ret.) David
Graham, the Director of the Army Jag School in Charlottesville. This trip builds on our January visit in which
we met with various Israeli officials, including the Chief of Staff of the IDF, to discuss follow-up to the
Goldstone Report.
Our approach has been to offer our support and willingness to work with the Government of Israel to reframe
the public debate from defensive (responding to Goldstone or Flotilla reports and resolutions at the UN, etc.) to
a more pro-active narrative focused on the challenges of fighting an urban or asymmetrical war. We are
having productive, and generally positive preliminary conversations about a possible GOI white paper that
would: 1) set the context, outlining the challenges in fighting an asymmetrical conflict; 2) spell out the steps the
IDF and other agencies have taken to address these challenges; and 3) identify ongoing challenges that Israel
and other professional armies will need to address in the future.
We have been clear that this must be an Israeli initiative, not ours, but that we can help promote and use the
report once it has been completed. Thus far we have met with Deputy Foreign Minister Dan Ayalon, Minister
without Portfolio Benny Begin, Justice Minister Yaakov Neeman, and Deputy PM, Dan Meridor. Meridor, in
particular is very interested and supportive of what we are exploring. Tomorrow we will meet with Gabi
Ashkenazi, the IDF Chief of Staff, and with several other senior IDF officials, including General Avichai
Mandelblit, the IDF's Judge Advocate, who has led the the government's investigation of the Goldstone/Cast
Lead cases.
At this juncture we do not expect or need you to raise any of this with the PM or other Israeli officials. I simply
wanted you to know what we are doing, and the status of these efforts, in case anyone in the Israeli delegation
raises this with you.
End note

Bill Clinton used to talk about building a bridge to the 21st century. President Obama talks about laying down a "new
foundation." But Clinton was always vague about what the land on the other side of that bridge was going to look like,
and Obama is vague about what edifice is going to go on top of that foundation.
They are vague because nobody is clear about what sort of country America is going to be in 2030 or 2050. Nobody has
quite defined America's coming economic identity.
In thinking about this question, it probably helps to start at the beginning. Five hundred years ago, agriculture was the
major economic activity. One hundred years ago, it was industrial production. Now, of course, we're living in an
information age. Innovation and creativity are the engines of economic growth.

Howard Gardner of Harvard once put together a composite picture of the extraordinarily creative person: She comes
from a little place somewhat removed from the center of power and influence. As an adolescent, she feels herself
outgrowing her own small circle. She moves to a metropolis and finds a group of people who share her passions and
interests. She gets involved with a team to create something amazing.
Then, at some point, she finds her own problem, which is related to and yet different from the problems that concern
others in her group. She breaks off and struggles and finally emerges with some new thing. She brings it back to her
circle. It is tested, refined and improved.
The main point in this composite story is that creativity is not a solitary process. It happens within networks. It happens
when talented people get together, when idea systems and mentalities merge.
Now imagine you are this creative person in the year 2010, 2025 or 2050. You are living in some small town in Ukraine or
Kenya or some other place, foreign or domestic. You long to break out and go to a place where people are gathering to
think about the things you are thinking about, creating the things you want to create.
If you are passionate about fashion, maybe you will go to Paris. If it's engineering, maybe it'll be Germany. But if you are
passionate about many other spheres, I suspect you'll want to be in America.
You'll want to be in the U.S. because English has become the global language. You'll want to come because American
universities lead the world in research and draw many of the best minds from all corners of the earth.
You'll want to be there because American institutions are relatively free from corruption. Intellectual property is
protected. Huge venture capital funds already exist.
Moreover, the United States is a universal nation. There are already people there with connections all over the world. A
nation of immigrants is more permeable than say, Chinese society.
You also observe that America hosts the right kind of networks — ones that are flexible and intense. Study after study
suggests that America is one of those societies with high social trust. Americans build large, efficient organizations that
are not bound by the circles of kinship and clan. Study after study finds that Americans are not hierarchical. American
children are raised to challenge their parents. American underlings are relatively free to challenge their bosses. In this
country you're less likely to have to submit to authority.
From this story you can see that economic power in the 21st century is not going to look like economic power in the
20th century. The crucial fact about the new epoch is that creativity needs hubs. Information networks need junction
points. The nation that can make itself the crossroads to the world will have tremendous economic and political power.
In 2009, Anne-Marie Slaughter, now director of policy planning at the State Department, wrote an essay for Foreign
Affairs in which she laid out the logic of this new situation: "In a networked world, the issue is no longer relative power,
but centrality in an increasingly dense global web."
Slaughter's essay was titled "America's Edge." That is apt. Americans are now in a depressed state of mind. As China and
India rise, nearly two-thirds of Americans believe their nation is in decline.
In fact, the U.S. is well situated to be the crossroads nation. It is well situated to be the center of global networks and to
nurture the right kinds of networks. Building that America means doing everything possible to thicken connections:
finance research to attract scientists; improve infrastructure to ease travel; fix immigration to funnel talent; reform
taxes to attract superstars; make study abroad a rite of passage for college students; take advantage of the millions of
veterans who have served overseas.
The nation with the thickest and most expansive networks will define the age. There's no reason to be pessimistic about
that.

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON
Iraqi Government Coalition Agreement
I applaud [rag's political leaders for working together to agree on an inclusive government that
represents the will of the Iraqi people and moves their country forward. Today's coalition
decision is a milestone in the emergence of the new Iraq and it is a testament to the
determination of the Iraqi people to build their own democracy, a goal only they can achieve.
This agreement ensures meaningful representation for the election winners, encompassing all of
Iraq's ethnic and sectarian communities. It also includes critical provisions for power-sharing
and other reforms, including revisions to the to the de-Ba'athification process. In addition, Iraqi
leaders have agreed to establish a National Council of Strategic Policies. This important body
will serve as a steering group in the areas of defense policy, foreign affairs, economic policy,
and other strategic issues.
As Iraqis continue their progress, they will have a committed and consistent partner in the
United States. Our relationship is rooted in mutual respect and mutual interest. We look
forward to expanding our cooperation under the Strategic Framework Agreement and together
pursuing our shared goal of building a long-term, multidimensional relationship between our
two nations that contributes to growing peace and prosperity in Iraq and security and stability in
the Middle East.

Today's tumultuous session of Iraq's COR culminated with the election and swearing in of Jalal Talabani as President,
and the immediate nomination of Nuni al Maliki as prime minister. Of more significance was the election of leading
Iraqiyya member Osama al-Nujayfi as speaker of the Council of Representatives. This represented Iraqiyya and Sunni
buy-in to the new, inclusive Government. As the newly nominated Prime Minister, Maliki now has 30 days to form the
Council of Ministers, which must be approved in the COR by absolute majority. 1.4(D)

These developments were marred by a theatric walkout by lraqiyya. Members of Iraqiyya had called for a motion to
cancel de-Baathification proceedings for Saleh Mutlaq and two others to be added to the COR agenda in advance of
voting on the presidency.

You may remember that I called on you early in the Administration on the UN statement on sexual
orientation. You were tremendous as was the Secretary. This request is not in keeping with the regular
hierarchy, but I had to send it. The video the Secretary did is extraordinarily powerful. Can you let her know
that individual employees in the building appreciate what she has been doing on LGBT rights? I know GLIFFA
will do so, but it's kind of their job to advocate. But if you could just tell her in a minute how deeply her work
is touching us in the trenches, well, it's something I think she deserves to hear.

JERUSALEM (AP) - Palestinians are expressing strong reservations about a U.S. proposal meant to entice Israel to
reinstate limits on West Bank settlement construction and revive peace talks. Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat did not
reject the proposal outright, but said a decision on whether to endorse it would be made after consultations with
Palestinian and Arab leaders. Erekat says the Palestinians "have a major problem in not including east Jerusalem."

Subject: (Reuters) Netanyahu presents U.S. settlement plan to cabinet
JERUSALEM (Reuters) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented a U.S. plan to his cabinet November 14
that would extend a freeze on West Bank settlements for 90 days in return for diplomatic and security incentives.
Washington wants Israel to renew a freeze on settlement building in efforts to resume peace talks with Palestinians,
who in September halted negotiations after just a few weeks when Israel refused to extend a 10-month settlement
freeze.
Under the U.S. proposal, if Israel extended the freeze Washington would pledge not to seek further extensions and to
veto any attempts at the United Nations to force a unilateral peace settlement.
U.S. security aid to Israel would also be upgraded.
"I will insist that in any proposal Israel's security needs will be addressed, both in the immediate term and regarding
the threats facing us in the coming decade," Netanyahu said in public comments before the cabinet meeting.
The prime minister has previously said any settlement moratorium will not apply to areas around East Jerusalem that
Israel captured during a 1967 war and the Palestinians want as the capital of a future state.
One official in Netanyahu's office said the proposal had "positive elements". Israeli political sources said a narrow
majority in Netanyahu's security cabinet, which is ultimately responsible, would likely support accepting the U.S.
proposal.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton shared the plan at a meeting in New York last week, Netanyahu said, adding that
U.S. and Israeli teams were still negotiating a final formula.
A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said there had been no official word regarding a renewed
Israeli freeze on housing starts in the occupied West Bank.
"An official Palestinian commitment will come only after President Abbas hears officially from the American
administration what is going on between them and the Israelis," Nabil Abu Rdainah told Reuters.
Palestinian officials in private have expressed anger over U.S. incentives to get Israel to prolong the partial freeze,
saying they were effectively bribing Israel to fulfill basic international obligations.
Israeli officials said Netanyahu, who faces a tough political sell within his own coalition on the settlement issue, had
pushed Clinton for the broad understandings.
Settler leaders, who said acceptance of the proposal would represent "a fundamental collapse" of the government's
integrity, called an emergency meeting to discuss the issue.
Under the U.S. plan, Israel would declare a further, three month suspension of construction in the West Bank, land it
captured in a 1967 war where Palestinians seek a state. Any building launched since the original moratorium ended late
in September would be frozen, a diplomatic source said.
Among the pledges offered to Israel by Washington was a guarantee to veto any resolutions brought to the United
Nations Security Council that seek "to impose a political settlement on Israel," the source said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
The United States would also undertake to veto resolutions deemed anti-Israel in the United Nations and other
international organisations, a move that could make Israel less vulnerable to threats made by some Palestinians to
declare statehood unilaterally in the event that peace talks fail.
The Obama Administration would also ask Congress to approve the supply of three billion dollars worth of advanced

The United States would further sign a more comprehensive deal to enhance its substantial security aid to Israel as
part of any agreement concluded with the Palestinians.

Gerry Adams to seek Louth nomination for General Election
Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams has today announced his decision to put his name forward for the Sinn
Fein nomination for the Louth constituency at the next General Election. Mr. Adams was speaking today
at the Edentubber commemoration in County Louth. He said:
"Ireland is at a crossroads. This state is in the midst of a deep economic and social crisis. This
Government is probably the most unpopular in the history of the state. It is now implementing bad,
deeply damaging policies. It has no mandate whatsoever for this.
There is a better way. Together we can rebuild Ireland.

People need to make a stand against what is happening. We need a better way forward for our country
and its people.
All this imposes a huge responsibility on those of us in positions of political leadership. In the past I
have asked people to step forward and to show leadership.
I have asked people to make a stand. I believe that it is my duty at this critical time to step forward and
do what I have asked of others.
As Leader of Sinn Fein, I want to be part of the necessary fight-back against bad economic policies in
both parts of this island and for a fair, decent and united society for all the people of Ireland.
As a representative of west Belfast I should be able to do this in the Dail, but the Irish government
refuses to allow this, despite a commitment during the Good Friday Agreement negotiations and
subsequently, by the then Taoiseach Bertie Ahem that he would introduce measures to allow speaking
rights for MPs from the north.
So, as Leader of the only all Ireland party with an all-island mandate I have a choice to make whether to
stay in west Belfast, a place that I love, or to seek a mandate in another constituency in the south. West
Belfast is my home. It is where Colette and our family are and where I live.
But after thoughtful consideration, and with the support of colleagues, I have decided to put my name
forward for Louth. If elected for this constituency I will work and stay here and travel home when
possible.
This means that I will be stepping down as an MLA for west Belfast. My replacement will be chosen
this week. I am proud and honoured to have represented the people of west Belfast in the Assembly. I
will remain as MP until the next Leinster House election.
This is a significant initiative by the Sinn'Fein leadership. It is a measure of our determination to provide
a real alternative to the consensus for cuts being pushed by the other parties.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774005 Date: 08/31/2015
Ireland needs political change. We need change in the Dail. We need more voices that will stand up
against the consensus for cuts – more voices that will stand up for ordinary people. We need new
politics. We need a political realignment.
A change of government without a change in policies will be worthless.
A Fine Gael led government, propped up by the Labour Party is not a real alternative.
Fine Gael and Labour offer nothing that is substantially different from the current government. They are
part of the consensus for cuts.
Sinn Fein is the only effective opposition in the Dail. We forced this government to hold the Donegal
South West by-election. We have shifted the debate on the economy by rejecting the consensus for cuts,
and producing a costed, viable economic programme that can protect the vulnerable and low and middle
income earners, while stimulating the economy and creating jobs.
This is a small island. The problems faced by citizens throughout the country are the same.
We have a republic only in name.
Sinn Fein is a republican party. We believe that a republic must first and foremost be about the welfare
of the community. This includes access to a decent public health service and the protection of vulnerable
people such as the old, the sick and those with disabilities.
It also includes at this time of crisis those who are economically vulnerable — including low and middle
income earners - a group that is growing in number by the day because of the bad policies pursued by
this Government.
As the leader of Sinn Fein, in this time of crisis in our country, I am making a stand with this initiative
— a stand for a better, fairer, united Ireland. I believe that things can be turned around. That there is a
better way.
Look at the progress that has been made in the north. The peace process has shown what is possible. The
North has been transformed for the better. Sinn Fein has led that transformation. We have demonstrated
what is possible when people work together in the common good, in the national interest, and for the
benefit of all.
Our focus at this time is on tackling the mistakes of this government and providing a real alternative to
the Fianna Fail lite policies of Fine Gael and Labour.

Whether it is charting a way out of conflict or striving to rebuild the economy, Sinn Fein is about
improving the quality of people's lives.
This must be the guide for the reconstruction of Ireland in the years ahead.
I intend to lead from the front.
The people of Ireland face enormous challenges at this time. But we are no mean people and I am
confident that with clear headed leadership and sound economic policies we can rebuild the economy
and return prosperity.
I want to pay tribute to Arthur Morgan who, for the past 8 years has been a first class representative for
the people of Louth and an outstanding member of Sinn Fein's Dail team.
I first met Arthur in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh where he was incarcerated for his republican beliefs.
I want to pay tribute to Marian. Without her Arthur could not have played the role that he has done over
the years.
He will continue to play an important role in Sinn Fein. His experience and talent will be available to
this party in Louth and nationally in the time ahead.

Erekat: PA to ask UN to recognize state soon
Chief negotiator says Palestinians will submit request as soon as Bosnia take over Security
Council presidency. 'Israeli government is witnessing an international isolation that it hasn't
witnessed before,' he says
The Palestinians will ask the United Nations Security Council to unilaterally recognize an independent Palestinian
state within the 1967 borders early next month, chief negotiator Saeb Erekat was quoted as saying by the Maan
News Agency Wednesday.
Speaking to reporters in the West Bank town of Jericho, Erekat said the Palestinians are waiting for Bosnia to take
the presidency of the Security Council before submitting the proposal.
"The Israeli government is witnessing an international isolation that it hasn't witnessed before," Erekat added. "And
this is due to the efforts exerted by the Palestinian leadership and by President Mahmoud Abbas."
According to the report, Erekat expressed hope that the US would not veto the proposal, and also called for South
Korea, Japan, New Zealand and Australia to unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state.
Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador and Bolivia have all recognized a Palestinian stare over the past few weeks.
The Palestinians have recently announced their plan to introduce a draft resolution at the UN Security Council
condemning Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
On Friday the London-based Arabic daily Al Hayat quoted Erekat as saying "the negotiations (with Israel) are over.
Now is the time for decisions, not negotiations."

Erekat: PA has no plans to request UN recognition of state
By JPOST.COM STAFF
Chief Palestinian negotiator denies reports that he said PA would request the UN Security Council unilaterally recognize
Palestinian state along 1967 borders, says PA will instead demand criticism of settlements.
Chief Palestinian Negotiator Saeb Erekat on Wednesday denied saying that the Palestinian Authority plans to request that
the United Nations Security Council unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state along 1967 borders, Israel Radio reported.
Erekat said that the Palestinians have no intention of presenting such a proposal in the near future and that the earlier
report by Palestinian news agency Ma'an was erroneous.
He explained that the PA plans on demanding that the UN Security Council criticize settlement building in the West Bank.
According to the earlier report, Erekat had said that the PA plan to present a proposal to the UN Security Council on the
unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state. He was also quoted as expressing hope that the US would not attempt to act
against the PA's attempts and also called for South Korea, Japan, New Zealand and Australia to unilaterally recognize a
Palestinian state.
The PA negotiator was speaking at a meeting of Palestinian security officials in the town of Jericho.
Erekat had added that PA President Mahmoud Abbas contacted international and Hamas officials in an effort to prevent
an Israeli attack on the Gaza Strip.
After Erekat denied the report, a senior official told Israel Radio that the negotiator's remarks prove that the Palestinians
are not interested in negotiations but are interested in forcing solutions.
The official said that the US will operate covertly to eliminate settlement criticism from the UN Security Council's agenda.
If they do not succeed, it may be possible to veto the proposal or to present a counter-proposal, the official added.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said the Palestinian efforts do little to promote peace.
"By choosing unilateralism over direct talks, the Palestinians are declaring that they renounce peace altogether," he said.
"The Palestinians are choosing not to renew negotiations and are doing all they can to score minor points. They are trying
everything except to talk."

Subject: (AP) Fate of Mideast talks in hands of polarizing rabbi
JERUSALEM (AP) - The future of the Mideast peace process could rest in the hands of one very undiplomatic man: an
outspoken 90-year-old rabbi who recently sparked an uproar by saying the Palestinian president should "perish from the
world." The ultra-Orthodox Shas Party is expected to hold the swing vote when Cabinet ministers decide on a U.S.
proposal to resume Mideast peace talks. The two Shas ministers participating in the decision are waiting for instructions
from the party's spiritual leader, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef. "All decisions go through the rabbi," said Roi Lachmanovitch, a
spokesman for the Shas interior minister. The drama has once again turned the enigmatic rabbi, who has managed to
offend Arabs, secular Jews, Holocaust survivors, women and gays with fiery comments over the years, into the familiar
role of kingmaker. Politicians from outside his party, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, are now lobbying for
his support. Officials in Netanyahu's office said his 15-member Security Cabinet - a group of senior government
ministers - remains closely divided, with the outcome of the vote hinging on the two Shas members. Amid the
uncertainty, Israeli officials said a planned vote for November 17 had been put on hold.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said on November 17 he believes a new START treaty

Gibbs said he believes an end-of-year session of the Senate will take up the arms control treaty and will be voted on

Hillary,
We of course understand and thank you for personally reaching out to us. It is a big loss for the weekend but as we
know it does not add up to a hill of beans. You are the best, and we remain your biggest fans.
Sweet dreams and Godspeed with everything you are doing.

Lynn,
I was trying to reach you to tell you and Teddy that I asked Tony Blair to go to Israel as part of our full court press on
keeping the Middle East negotiations going. He told me that he had a commitment in Aspen w you two and the
conference, but after we talked, he decided to go and asked me to tell you. He is very sorry, obviously, but I'm grateful
that he accepted my request. I hope you all understand and give him a raincheck.
If you were interested, he might be able to satellite in if you have the technology available.
He should land around Sam Aspen time. Let me know what penance I owe you. And pls explain to Teddy. As ever, H

Lynn,
I was trying to reach you to tell you and Teddy that I asked Tony Blair to go to Israel as part of our full court press on
keeping the Middle East negotiations going. He told me that he had a commitment in Aspen w you two and the
conference, but after we talked, he decided to go and asked me to tell you. He is very sorry, obviously, but I'm grateful
that he accepted my request. I hope you all understand and give him a raincheck.
If you were interested, he might be able to satellite in if you have the technology available.
He should land around Sam Aspen time. Let me know what penance I owe you. And pls explain to Teddy. As ever, H

US major GE wins engine bid for Indian LCAs
NEW DELHI: US aircraft engine manufacturer (GE) Aviation today won the bid for supplying engines for the Indian
programme and the deal is estimated to be worth over $600 million.
GE pipped its European competitor Eurojet for the deal after DRDO, which is developing the LCA's mark II version,
formally announced that the American major's was the lowest bid in the tenders that saw a long-drawn battle for over
two years.
"GE was declared as the lowest bidder" by the Price Negotiating Committee headed by Chief Controller for Aerospace
systems Dr Prahlada.
"The Prime Negotiating Committee for the alternate engine for LCA Mk 2 has finalised the comparative statement of
tenders...After evaluation and acceptance of the technical offer provided by both Eurojet and GE Aviation, the
commercial quotes were compared in detail and GE Aviation was declared as the lowest bidder," an official statement
from DRDO said in New Delhi.
The committee also had representatives from Defence Ministry, Defence Finance, Aeronautical Development Agency,
DRDO, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, Indian Air Force and Indian Navy.
"Further price negotiations and contract finalisation will follow," the release added.
Though the order could be for 99 engines initially, will have the option of order for another 100 engines in the future.
GE had offered its GE F-414 engine as an alternative to its GE F-404 engines that are fitted in the first batch of LCAs that
IAF would receive in a couple of years from now.
Eurojet had offered its EJ-200 engines for the LCA Mk II aircraft that is under development now.

ZARDARI CALLS FOR FLOOD TAX
By Syed Irfan Raza
DAWN Thursday, 30 Sep, 2010
ISLAMABAD: President Asif Ali Zardari asked the government on Wednesday to levy a one-time flood tax on wealthy
people.
"A one-time flood tax will have to be imposed on the well-off and people of means to help shore up relief and
rehabilitation efforts," he said at a meeting of women ministers, parliamentarians and representatives of non-
governmental organisations.
"Unless we are prepared to share bread with our grief- and disaster-stricken brethren, we should not expect others to
help us.
"I have already advised the government to tap into indigenous resources wherever there is room," he said.

The president said that funds would be disbursed transparently and every citizen would have access to information
relating to the aid received and distributed.

Subject: Dealing with Netanyahu
The principle conclusion from a quick visit to Israel and Ramallah over the weekend is that Netanyahu is in a strong
position politically, with an unusually stable ruling coalition. Nobody I spoke with believed that the government would
have fallen if he had decided to extend the settlement freeze before its expiry, as a gesture to U.S. peacemaking efforts.
In their view, he could have easily garnered the support of a large majority of the people, for whom the settlers are a
marginal concern. And this would have given him leverage over his ministers to ensure their support or abstention in
the cabinet. As Dan Meridor noted, Likud voters are to the left of their Knesset members when it comes to peacemaking
(70 percent support the two-state solution, vs only 50 percent of the leadership).
Lieberman, not the Likud, is Bibi's chief concern. He wants to keep him in the government for as long as possible for fear
that when he leaves he will garner the support of those on the right, including from the Likud, who oppose
peacemaking. For the time being, Bibi uses the threat of an alternative coalition with Kadima to keep Lieberman in the
tent. But the clock is ticking. According to Tzipi Livni, she can bring her party into the government now, and is willing to
do so without any demand for "rotation," provided Bibi is serious about negotiating peace. But as the elections grow
closer, more and more of her party members are turning against the idea of joining the government. They are
strengthened in their views by recent internal polling which shows Kadima with 32 seats (up from 28 now), Likud slightly
down at 25, and Labor at only 5.
Therefore, if Bibi intends to make a deal with Abu Mazen, he will need to do so sooner rather than later. The longer he
waits, the less leverage he has on Lieberman and the more likely Lieberman will break away to oppose him in the next
elections.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775254 Date: 08/31/2015
In this context, Bibi's negotiating tactics become self-defeating. Believing that he is a great negotiator, and that he is
operating in the Middle East bazaar, he inflates his requirements well beyond anything reasonable in the belief that this
is the best way to secure the highest price. The process of bringing him down to a reasonable price uses up a lot of
energy, uses up a lot of goodwill, humiliates his Palestinian negotiating partner, and raises doubts about his seriousness.
In the end, under great pressure from all quarters, he will make the final concession, but only after wasting a lot of time,
making everybody furious with him, and thereby securing no credit either with his supporters or negotiating partners.
At heart, he seems to lack a generosity of spirit. This combines with his legendary fear of being seen as a "freier"
(sucker) in front of his people to create a real problem in the negotiations, especially because he holds most of the
cards.
This is further complicated by his introduction of the notion of "creative ideas." Thinking out of the box, as he likes to
do, will only further delay the negotiations because the box is already well-defined. To attempt to broaden the
parameters will generate mistrust of his intentions on the Palestinian side just when direct negotiations provide the
opportunity to build trust.
The reason for dwelling on Bibi's psychology rather than his politics is that the latter all point in the direction of making a
deal: the Israeli public is ready to get on with it; if Israel doesn't make a serious move, it will further delegitimize its
standing internationally (something Bibi is deeply concerned about); Bibi needs President Obama in his corner to deal
with the threat from Iran and to avoid punishment by the voters for mishandling relations with the U.S.; and if he
doesn't make the deal with Abu Mazen now, he will have helped to advance the future he is most concerned about - a
Hamas takeover of the Palestinian leadership.
Yuval Diskin was quite clear about this latter point. After praising the Palestinian security services to the sky (unusual for
him) he told me that he had warned Bibi that at the moment they have a high motivation to prevent terror because they
believe they are building their state. If that proves to be an illusion, the motivation will disappear and then he cannot
guarantee security in the West Bank. He considers it quite possible that if Bibi doesn't quickly demonstrate his
seriousness to Abu Mazen, he will resign because his honor has now been seriously damaged. He told Bibi that he
cannot predict who will lead the Palestinians if Abu Mazen resigns, but that Salam Fayyad will likely have to go too.
What is to be done? I have no magic solution for what must be a deeply frustrating exercise for you. And please forgive
me if what I recommend here is just repeating what you already know.
1.Put your arm around Bibi: he still thinks we are out to bring him down. There is no substitute for working with him,
even though he makes it such a frustrating process. But the purpose of embracing him is to nudge him forward, not to
buy into his exaggerated political fears or accept his inflated demands.
2.Try to find a way to make him understand that his negotiating tactics are counterproductive to his own purposes. The
Obama Administration has done a great deal lately to underscore its concern for Israel's security, from the vote at the
IAEA, to the sanctions on Iran, to the letter that Obama was willing to sign that accepted Bibi's security requirements.
That should buy you credibility with him.
3. As his friend, paint a realistic picture of the strategic consequences of his negotiating tactics, particularly in terms of
what is likely to happen to the PA leadership if he worries only about his politics and not at all about Abu Mazen's
politics.
4. If all else fails, avoid recriminations in favor of a "clarifying moment." The world will of course blame Bibi. But you
should avoid any kind of finger-pointing in favor of a repeated commitment to a negotiated solution and a willingness to
engage with both sides in trying to make that happen, when they're ready. The Israeli public and the American Jewish
Community should know how far the President was prepared to go and they should be allowed to draw their own
conclusions. Bibi, Abu Mazen, and the Arab states need negotiations and time is not on the side of any of them. They
will come back to the table sooner rather than later as long as we keep the door open.

Karzai firm on deadline for security firms
by Javed Hamim Kakar on 24 October, 2010 - 16:54 KABUL (PAN): President Hamid Karzai has firmly rejected a joint
request from US, British and German ambassadors to extend the deadline for disbanding private security firms in the
country, his office said on Sunday.
At a special meeting, President Karzai told the foreign officials that the private security companies had established a
parallel government in the war-torn country, something he would not allow.
Ambassadors Karl Eikenberry (US), William Patey (UK), Ambassador Rijdiger Konig (Germany),ISAF Commander Gen.
David Petraeus and NATO's special civilian representative, Mark Sidwell, were among the foreign officials who attended
the meeting.
Karzai issued a four-month deadline for dissolving all foreign and Afghan security companies, a move he believes will
help stabilise Afghanistan."I addressed the problem five years ago but our international friends warned of halting
development projects," Karzai was quoted in a statement from his office.
"I again raised the issue three years ago and international community representatives asked for an additional two years.
But now the Afghan government is determined to dissolve the companies," Karzai told the foreign envoys.
Japan's deputy ambassador also took part in the meeting. The president told the ambassadors to convey their security
concerns about the implementation of projects to the government. Karzai would continue to meet foreign officials who
expressed serious concerns over the presidential decree banning the security firms, the statement added.

I hope you don't read any of this but I've given Huma a complete draft of QDDR plus four key docs:
The first is the decision memo you asked for; second is recommendations for reforming rather than eliminating 10
bureau; third and fourth are two alternative approaches to the major development initiatives (one is the standard
approach; the other is Cheryl's that she'd like to discuss with you).

Dear Mr. Sullivan:
Intending to expose U.S. government lies, the latest Wikileaks only prove U.S. diplomats' professionalism, writes Les
Gelb in his latest blog.

Wikileaks Accidentally Helps U.S.
by Leslie H. Gelb
November 30, 2010 I 10:42pm
**Julian Assange clearly intended the State Dept. cable leaks to smear the U.S. as evil and selfish. Leslie H. Gelb on how
he inadvertently proved the opposite.**
The Wikileakers dumped a vast pile of secrets to prove that the United States was selfish, stupid and wicked-but their
revelations proved just the opposite. When you remove the gossip and obvious trivia that mesmerized the press, you
clearly see what the Wikileakers never expected: A United States seriously and professionally trying to solve the most
dangerous problems in a frighteningly complicated world, yet lacking the power to dictate solutions. U.S. policymakers
and diplomats are shown, quite accurately, doing what they are supposed to do: ferreting out critical information from
foreign leaders, searching for paths to common action, and struggling with the right amount of pressure to apply on
allies and adversaries. And in most cases, the villain is not Washington, but foreign leaders escaping common action with
cowardice and hypocrisy.

Don't think for a New York minute that Julian Assange, the Wikileaker, unloaded this trove to save humankind. Why did
he toss in those cables about Italy's leader being a rake and Germany's chancellor being a cautious fuddy-duddy, and
President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan being "paranoid"? To save the world? Not a chance. He did it to get attention,
and he got attention from a drooling press, which then went on to call the very material they were highlighting trivial.
Did Assange leak critical conversations with Chinese or Arab leaders to help solve the problems in Korea and Iran? Not
by the hair on your chinny chin chin. He did it to show that he could do it-and for the attention. Anyone who is not a
hopeless left-wing ideologue knows that such leaks will crush future serious conversations with those leaders for some
time to come. Just think: if you told someone a serious and critical confidence about someone else, and your confidant
went out and told others, would you soon repeat that mistake? Assange did not leak these cables to help solve world
problems. These leaks were absolutely gratuitous and served only the purpose of making him a media marvel.
In explaining his deed publicly, Assange suggests that what he's doing is uncovering American misdeeds and lies. His aim,
he says, is to inform citizens of democracies and peoples around the world about what their leaders are really doing.
Assange also insists he did this for transparency's sake. Yet when he got to look inside, he didn't see what was plain: that
our diplomats were doing a good job. Indeed, when you turn off his nonsense and stop listening to the strange
commentary on cable news and even on the front pages of great newspapers, when you actually read the cables, here's
what you see: American leaders and American diplomats trying to solve crucial world problems.
But when you turn off his nonsense and stop listening to the strange commentary on cable news and even on the front
pages of great newspapers, when you actually read the cables, here's what you see: American leaders and American
diplomats trying to solve crucial world problems.
-Washington needs China's help in bolstering sanctions against Iran, and China balks for fear of jeopardizing its oil and
gas flow from that country. The Obama team arranges for Saudi Arabia to guarantee any loss in supply to China. If the
world wants to slow or even prevent Iran's march to nuclear weaponry, this is a key path to doing so.
-The U.S. discovers that North Korea has manufactured new medium-range missiles and is trying to deliver them to Iran
through China. The Obama team discovers this, informs Beijing, and asks Beijing to stop the transfer. Beijing declines.
Really creepy.
-Yemen's leader takes public responsibility for American missile attacks against Al Qaeda in Yemen. He wants to diminish
the power of these terrorists, as do Americans and most others in the world. The "lie" by the Yemeni president is a
harmless way to get a critical job done-that is, the job of fighting international terrorism. Wikileaks tears away the
political cover of Yemen's leaders.
-No country has anywhere near as much influence over nutty North Korea as China. So, U.S. diplomats are searching
desperately to figure out Chinese thinking about North Korea in order to compose a plan for avoiding war on the Korean
Peninsula. So, the Wikileakers expose some Chinese leaders who are actually trying to give us some insight into Chinese
thinking about North Korean craziness. They won't do that again soon.
Time and again, as one actually reads these cables, one has to be heartened by the professionalism and the insights of
U.S. diplomats. What are they doing? They are not lying, and U.S. leaders are not lying. They are actually, believe it or
not, trying to solve problems. That seriousness of purpose and the professionalism to execute it is what jumps out at you
in these materials.
So, the naïve say, it's good to show the effectiveness of our diplomats. Give me a break. Ask any American diplomat to
choose between looking intelligent in leaked cables and making progress toward avoiding war.
None of this is to say that there should not be leaks, or that the press should not pursue classified information that is
necessary or very helpful to a sensible public debate on policy. If a U.S. administration is lying, or distorting the facts, or
telling one story to the public and another to itself, then by all means, let's have it out in public. If the U.S. government is
concocting intelligence in order to justify wars, let's hope an enterprising reporter finds it out for the rest of us.

But the Wikileaks dump is not about providing essential information to Americans or to others-information they need
for serious policy discussion. This massive trashing by Wikileaks of a legitimate effort by the U.S. government to preserve
confidentiality is the very least a shame and at the most, a crime.

Spoke to both Condi Rice and Jim Baker this afternoon re START op-ed. Condi said she plans her own op-ed, arguing in
favor of treaty ratification, due out in next few days. She asked that I tell the Secretary again that she'll be supportive.
Baker said he agreed that things were breaking the right way on the Hill, and shared the view that ratification before the
holidays is an increasing possibility. He was glad to have done the op-ed (even while complaining mildly about how
much effort it took to "herd the cats" to get it out), and hopeful of its effect.

made a sport of maligning him. This business of corruption doesn't take into account
cultural differences. And last but not least, who are we here in Washington to be moaning
and groaning about corruption?
CA: Let me ask you then, should Ambassador Eikenberry leave? I mean, has he done a good job,
do you think, for the diplomacy, George?
GW: Well he has a hopeless job to do, so it's hard to say whether he's done it well. If he
should leave because of what was said in the -
CA: What he has written in the cables?
GW: Well, who's going to be left in the government, starting with the Secretary of State?
ZK: I think he has been damaged very badly by the leaks that have taken place here in
Washington, before WikiLeaks and afterwards. And a trusting relationship, if that is the
objective, and I believe it ought to be, would require I think changes to the personnel that
are responsible on a day-to-day basis in dealing with President Karzai.
... [exchange about corruption and about Iran]
CA: Do you think, I asked George, Ambassador Eikenberry is doing a good job and should he
stay in his position?
ZK: Well I think he's doing a good job, but I think he's no longer an effective interlocutor
due to the leaks.
CA: Which means?
ZK: Which means that if we want to deal with the issue of partnership with the government of
Afghanistan, if we want to deal with the issue of domestic politics effectively, catalyzing
cooperation, we would need to have a new team to be able to do that.

agreed that it will come last — so right now there will be a quick mention of Egypt at the top by Elisa Massimino from
Human Rights First (who will open the meeting and serve as traffic cop). Then Karen Ryan from the Carter Center will
raise DRC, followed by Ken Roth of Human Rights Watch who will raise Af/Pak issues, then David Kramer (former A/S in
DRL now at Freedom House) raising China issues. The goal is to allow 15 minutes at the end for S (along with Dan Friend
and Harold ) to raise Gitmo issues and ask for their support. We now have 45 minutes for the meeting

Remarks of the Spokesman of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan about the
Sudden Death of Holbrooke.
According to credible news agencies of the world, the American president's Special Envoy for
Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke, died in George Washington's University hospital
at the age of 69. He had been suffering from a heart's disease for the past days.
Appointed on 22nd January 2009, as special envoy for Afghanistan/ Pakistan, Holbrooke was
keeping an eye on the Afghan issue. Some times ago, he told reporters that he had been passing
through a difficult phase of his life, exerting crippling and sapping pressure on him.
He passed out in his exclusive office for Afghanistan and regional affairs on Friday last,
following his above-mentioned reveals and his life of toils and fatigues ended after admission
into a hospital where he breathed his last yesterday.
The American rulers have not made any remarks about the cause of his sudden death in view of
the sensitivity of the issue but rumors have it that this giant of the American politics and
diplomacy became ill with a heart disease when his previous fame and credibility came under
question after the unremitting failures of the mission of Afghanistan and his facing the difficult
task. The protracted Afghan war and the descending trajectory of the Americans' handling of the
warfare in the country had had a lethal dent on Holbrook's health as a high-ranking American
official. He was grappling with a constant psychological stress.
Emergence of this untoward phenomenon as an off-shoot of the Afghan issue is not now a strange
thing. The same was the case with the former Soviet Union as the crisis touched its climax.
Former Soviet leaders Brezhnev, Konstantin Cherninkove and Vladimir
Andropov had heart attacks in a short time distance before the coming to scene of Michael
Gorbachove. They relieved themselves of the hard task of the Afghan mission by retreating into
the lap of death.

The recent symptoms are indicating that an outbreak of the same epidemic diseases has
started in the political and military echelons of America.
A few months ago, an American four stars general„ general David Peteraeus, fainted
during a senate hearing when he faced tough questions as regards the issue of
Afghanistan. The end of Holbrooke, the fate of general Mc Crystal and the defense
Secretary Robert Gate's warning to step down show that the war of Afghanistan is heavily
weighing down on the psyche of the American military and political high-ups. Some of them
lighten their burden by simply going to the other world and others, while being still alive, choose
to avoid shouldering the mission.
The sudden death of a high-ranking American diplomat happens in a time that American
strategists under the chair of Obama have been reviewing the issue of Afghanistan for the past
few days. They will expectedly announce their decision soon.
We believe Holbrooke's timely death could have a didactic effect on the American strategists,
teaching them many things to learn. In view of the American entanglement in the aggravating
swamp of Afghanistan, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan calls on the American powers-that-be
to abandon their dream of military domination and colonial sway in Afghanistan. Their
formulation of new military strategies will never change the imminent defeat into a victory in the
country. Still if they are bent on continuing with the status quo, they will face many unexpected
events and imbroglios. Their political and military circles will have to grapple with constant crisis
and untoward situations. Nothing more than that, they will achieve.
Qari Yousaf Ahamadi
Spokesman of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.

I am up in the middle of the night in Brussels and took a quick stab at stringing together some of the pieces of the "moral
argument". I am not sure how coherent it all is, (caveat lector) and don't want to confuse efforts to pull together talkers
for 5, but thought I'd share.
This could be boiled down further into key points (and the below is meant to stand on its own as an argument but not be
exclusive of others—re internet freedom and wikileaks, for example)
But I think it gets at some of what I think is missing...esp the bit at the end about the alternative---
D
1) Clear thinking demands avoiding simple analogies, or false syllogisms. Some have called WL
whistleblowing. Some have lauded it for contributing to transparency. But the comparison and inferences don't
hold up. Whistleblowing is when someone reveals an act of official wrongdoing, and because it is official
wrongdoing we assume that it's in the public interest to know about this and hold the culprits
accountable. Instead what WL is exposing, by and large, is a vast number of official acts of rightdoing-
diplomats engaged often with partners from other governments or civil society, in solving the kind of practical
problems that arise in a world made up of nearly two hundred nations. Many of the legitimate objectives of
these officials—whether securing dangerous materials or negotiating agreements that will advance good
governance and human rights—cannot be accomplished in a single conversation or interaction. Instead they are
long-term ongoing projects that require trust, tactical sequencing of interactions, and above all, confidence. It's
not the ultimate objectives that are confidential—indeed, they are quite public and leaders routinely outline
them in speeches, world peace, security, prosperity, etc. Rather it's simply the case that accomplishing good
objectives demands the kind of cooperative engagement that confidential relations permit, and so, while we can
and should maintain a general commitment to transparency, we also can and should recognize that a responsible
government that that is to be held accountable for delivering benefits for its people, will sometimes need to
work in confidence in order to do so. Whistleblowing exposes misconduct that runs counter to the interests of
citizens. Wikileaks undermines good conduct on behalf of citizens.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05778445 Date: 08/31/2015
2) Absent a world government, it is the relations between states and peoples, whether through formal institutions
or everyday conversations and connections, that provides global governance. The formal relations between
states, made up of so many constellations of individual interactions, weave the fabric of a blanket of peace and
stability, one which creates a permissive environment in which states can live up to their responsibility to
provide for and protect people's rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the ICCPR and other
documents international and domestic lay out the standards, but it is the quality of governance at both the
domestic and international levels that determines whether or not people enjoy those rights in their everyday
lives.
3) Some of those who are cheering Assange mistakenly believe that his action constitutes a speech act in a debate
about good governance—that his action constitutes a kind of critique, a demand for a particular kind of better
behavior. But it doesn't constitute a critique or a demand—this is not an exchange with another interlocutor
about a particular position or action. The exposure of 250,000 cables isn't a critique of any one of them; it's an
attempt to harm the medium itself—confidential communication among governments—rather than a rejection
of the messages. This isn't part of a particular debate, it's an action that undermines a key pillar of the system of
governance in which all debates can safely take place, in which individuals can, if they're lucky enough to live
in the kind of places that Assange has spent his life, make specific criticisms of the government, march, speak
out, protest, and do so with the protection of the rule of law.
4) In this specific case it is the communications of the United States that have been compromised. We regret the
embarrassment this has caused with some of our partners. We deplore the risk it has imposed on innocent
people on the frontlines of struggles against corruption or rights abuses around the world. But we are taking
steps to manage the consequences, address them, and to make future incidents less likely. But the attack on
legitimate confidential relations between governments is not an attack on the particular government in question,
it's an attack on the constellation of relationships and interactions referenced above, the informal agreements,
debates, discussions, etc through which governments around the world manage—imperfectly to be sure—to
work out their differences and find common ground and common cause; to maintain global order and stability
on which the security of their citizens and the citizens of other nations depends; to support and sustain the
commercial networks that can augment global prosperity; to do, in short, what citizens count on their
governments to do.
5) If wikileaks seeks to undermine this mode of international politics, it's not clear what it seeks to replace it
with. A world in which every step of climate negotiations were exposed in real time would not be more
prepared to confront the threat of climate change. A world in which every discussion among finance ministers
were immediately publicized would not have fewer financial crises. A world in which every discussion of how
to counter plots of terrorists or secure dangerous nuclear materials were on the front pages of the world's
newspapers would not be more safe.

Richard Holbrooke was a piece of work. He was a paradoxical man: a remarkably subtle thinker capable of the
most egregious lack of subtlety, a brilliant diplomat with one of the least diplomatic temperaments anybody
ever encountered. He was always cunning but never malevolent. Mentally, he was sleepless, relentlessly
pondering the meanings of even the most trivial events and experiences. An example: Decades ago Holbrooke
was strolling down Madison Avenue with a friend. .A man passed them and said "Hi, Dick". Holbrook.e stopped
in his tracks, turned to his friend, and said: "I wonder what he meant by that." Sleepless.) His powers of
observation were extraordinary, the cognitive advantage of his utter extroversion; and they were matched by his
massive powers of analysis, which never shut down. He was a disorderly man with an ordered mind; there was
rigorous reflection at the heart of the Whirlwind. He was, almost preposterously, in constant motion. a stranger
to cairn, a bull in search of a china shop; but in his thinking, and in his commitment to his country, he was one
of the steadiest men on earth.

The legend of his career, and the flamboyance of his person, has obscured a proper recognition of his
commitments. Holbrooke was not only a student of power; he was also a creature of beliefs. What he believed
in most of all, I think, was in the ability, and the duty, of the United States, by a variety of means, to better the
world.. He was, in his cast of mind., a realist, but his cast of mind was not his philosophy: this realist—the
Democrats' most accomplished Machiavellian--was always returning to first principles, to moral
considerations, to the alleviation of human suffering and the spread of political liberty as goals of American
statecraft. He came away. from his early years in Vietnam with lessons but without a syndrome. He was
unanguished about the use of American force, when it was morally justified and intelligently applied—which is
to say, he was the last of the postwar liberals. Even in his most virulent criticism of what he regarded as
America's military mistakes abroad, there was not a trace of the temptation to surrender a high sense of
America's role in history. Isolationism disgusted him. He had a natural understanding, it was almost an attribute
of his character, of the relationship between diplomacy and force. He had no illusions about the harshness of the
world, arid therefore about the toughness that is required for the creation of a world less harsh. His last
assignment, the increasingly Sisyphean attempt to bring Afghanistan into the community of open and. decent
societies, was a bet on this sober and unsentimental optimism. He cared famously about what worked, and he
could be brazen in his pragmatism, but Holbrook& s professional life was animated by goals and concepts that
no mere pragmatist could share. American interventionism, for him, was not just a policy; it was a way of
existing responsibly in the world, the measure of a national (and personal) ideal, the real greatness of a great
power.
It was this rare package of means and ends, of ideas and instruments, that made possible Holbrooke's triumph at
Dayton. He negotiated a peace with a villain whom he deeply despised, and thereby ended a genocide in which
W(, the United States, and an administration from his own party, had outrageously acquiesced. In this way hie
helped to restore the honor of his country after a period of disgrace. On the day that Holbrooke suffered the
cataclysmic collapse from which he never recovered, The New York Times reported that Henry Kissinger—the
Republicans' most accomplished. Machiavellian—remarked in 1973 that "if they put Jews into gas chambers in
the Soviet Union, it is not an American concern. Maybe a humanitarian concern." Such unforgettably filthy
words would never have crossed Richard Holbrooke's lips. In government and out, not least in his
groundbreaking work at Refugees international, his career was a loud and effective refutation of that chilling
"maybe."
He was also an intellectual. He edited, he wrote (for my pages, too), he read. He raised a lasting institution of
intellectuality in the American Academy in Berlin. His renowned attraction to journalists was not just a more or
less charming campaign of spin; in his unslakable desire for the latest news and the immediate interpretation of
it, he was one of their company. There was so much about which. this genuinely cosmopolitan 1-lan did not need
to be briefed. He had an appetite for complexity, though it never crippled him in his practice. it was Holbrook.e,
more than anybody else, NA1110 fbctised American planning upon the most disturbing contemporary complexity of
all: the grim fact that the pursuit of our national security in Central Asia depends as much, if not mole, upon
Pakistan than upon Afghanistan. And after he edited and wrote and read, and before, and during, he talked.
Holbrooke's talk was a kind of rolling chronicle of his times, a rush of concepts and gossip, brash, probing,
lin-patient, occasionally outrageous, with a fine feeling for absurdity in the mix—the richest display of his
prodigious vitality. He was faster on his feet than anybody I have ever known. it was a joy, and an amusement,
to behold.
We were friends for almost three decades. He was a constant source of fascination--I had never before
encountered such a union of iMrigue and idealism; but mostly he inspired admiration and affection. Now th.e
unstoppable man has been stopped, and the man who was everywhere is nowhere. If only he could have gotten
the angel of death around a table....

Madam Secretary,
The outpouring of condolences from the international community and the Afghans for Richard's passing has been
extraordinary. We have had a steady flow of visitors from the NATO and diplomatic community and, most importantly,
Afghans of every walk of life for several days who have come to sign the condolence book.
Today, during my weekly meeting with President Karzai, I took along the condolence book to be signed at the
Palace. President Karzai signed and wrote a nice tribute to Richard and graciously allowed us to bring an Embassy
photographer to memorialize the occasion. A photograph is attached. We will separately arrange for a copy to be
signed by President Karzai for Kati.
Separately, I would ask that you thank Mike Mullen for permitting the USO show with which he is traveling to stage an
unprecedented performance at the U.S. Embassy today. Allowing Embassy Kabul to be the site of a USO show in
Afghanistan was very gracious of Mike as normally USO shows are only held at military bases. We had an extraordinary
turnout of our civilian and military team from all over Kabul gathered today to see Robin Williams and other
entertainers. Mike remains a real champion of our civil-military cooperation and teamwork.
Respectfully,
Karl
