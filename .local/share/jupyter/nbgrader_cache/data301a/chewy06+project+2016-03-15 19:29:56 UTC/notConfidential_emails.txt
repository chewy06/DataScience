The US Ambassador to UNESCO is launching a fierce, ferocious, unfair campaign against the Egyptian candidate to
UNESCO Minister Farouk Hosni.
If Washington does not want him â for whatever reasons â this is acceptable as their choice, but we think the US, with
its principles and weight, should be a fair partner and an objective leader.
People here are surprised at the position of the US Ambassador. They say "We want to feel that change is not just a
Motto but starts a new era in our relationship"
Hosni is an open-minded person who respects all religions. He is accused of being Anti-Jewish. That is not true. The
allegation is based on a quote out of context. He is translating Hebrew literature, restored Synagogues and is
establishing a Jewish Museum. He rescued the torah scrolls and has the symbols of the three religions appear together
in Video Clips, Pictures and documentaries about Egypt.
For these, and similar reasons, the fundamental â Terrorists are against him and are the ones working hard to block his
election.

Thanks, Hillary. I don't know about details of Obama's plan, but you looked terrific at the speech. (Lincoln, in 1864, on
Obama's plan: "The difficulty is not in stating the principle, it is in applying it.") Too bad Rep. Wilson didn't wear a red
pantsuit.
Max continues to rocket--up to #8 overall this am, #1 in every nonfiction category except cookbooks. And last night in an
special election Jackie was elected Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner in DC. It was a hard fought race, in fact, and
her opponent ran a negative campaign against her on email with the slogan: "She's Not Jackie."
Here's the draft of the article Max has written on the bad Joe Wilson (membership in racist organization) and that will be
published today. This should do it.
Let's speak when you have time.
Rep. Joe Wilson's Rebel Yell
Inside the racist klavern that Joe Wilson joined By Max Blumenthal
Since Republican Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina bellowed at President Barack Obama, "You lie!" during the
president's nationally televised speech on healthcare, the fourth term backbencher has emerged as a hero among the
conservative grassroots. One of the most enthusiastic endorsements of Wilson's histrionics came from the Sons of
Confederate Veterans (SCV), a group that Wilson has <a href=http://crooksandliars.com/david-neiwert/obama-heckler-
joe-wilson-member-neo>belonged to</a> for several years.
"Mr. Wilson, never apologize for allowing your love of truth to overrun your desire to be polite," the SCV Tea Party <a
href=http://scvteaparty.com/?p=165>declared</a> on its website. "It is the liar who must apologize, not the one who
identifies the liar!"
Who are the SCV? A once-proud organization of Confederate history buffs and re-enactors who spent their
organization's money to restore Civil War-era battlefields and Confederate cemeteries, by 2006 the SCV was
substantially <a href=http://www.spIcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?pid=1027 >taken over</a> by an organized
cadre of white supremacist radicals (read <a href=http://www.spIcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?pid=154
>here</a> for more background) who sought to turn the nation's oldest Southern historical society into what the
veteran white supremacist activist Kirk Lyons called "a modern, 21st century Christian war machine capable of uniting
the Confederate community and leading it to ultimate victory." When the racist junta had seized much of the SCV's
leadership positions, the Southern Poverty Law Center released an <a
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759668 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759668 Date: 06/30/2015
href=http://www.spIcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?sid=90 >extensive list</a> of SCV officials who belonged to
"hate groups."
Lyons, a key leader of the white supremacists who took over the SCV, had <a
href=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20050829/blumenthal/single >harbored dreams</a> of creating a seemingly
benign front group for a more sophisticated version of the Ku Klux Klan. "I have great respect for the Klan historically,
but, sadly the Klan today is ineffective and sometimes even destructive," Lyons told a German neo-Nazi magazine in
1992. "It would be good if the Klan followed the advice of former Klansman Robert Miles: 'Become invisible. Hang the
robes and hoods in the cupboard and become an underground org anization." With the SCV, Lyons discovered he didn't
have to go underground after all.
Once Lyons helped install his close friend, Ron Wilson, as president of the SCV, the organization's political newsletter, <a
href=http://fpacscv.org/southernmercury/ >The Southern Mercury</a> (where Wilson served as senior editor),
transformed into a propaganda mill for crude white supremacist cant. Mailed to all dues-paying members of the SCV â
presumably including Rep. Joe Wilson â until it went defunct in 2008, the Mercury has published articles describing
blacks as genetically inferior to whites, calling African-Americans as "a childlike people," and warned that if Obama runs
for re-election, race riots of an "exceedingly violent nature" would immediately ensure, leaving "entire sections of some
of our cities in ruins."
Here are a few highlights from the Southern Mercury:
"After the turn of the 20th century, the white Southerners had disfranchised and segregated the blacks, in perhaps the
mildest reaction possible at=2 Othat time to the blacks' transgressions. The blacks â then a childlike people â had been
selling their votes to the Democrats en masse for $.25 apiece in national elections."
â"Where We Stand Now, And How We Got Here," by Frank Conner, Southern Mercury, September/October 2003
"Previously, anthropologists had routinely recorded the notable differences in IQ among the races; but at Columbia, a
liberal cultural anthropologist named Franz Boas...decreed that there were no differences in IQ among the races, and the
only biological differences between the blacks and whites were of superficial nature... Meanwhile, the liberals in the
media heaped special praise upon black athletes, musicians, singers, and writers â and treated them as typical of the
black race. The liberals were creating a false image of the blacks in America as a highly competent people who were
being held back by the prejudiced white Southerners."
--Conner, September/October 2003
"It is very clear to me that if Barack Obama should be elected President, he would be extremely anti-white and would
demand reparations for slavery and press hard for affirmative action to the degree that it would hurt young whites who
were seeking jobs or admission to College and Graduate Schools."
â
"Americans Face The Worst Presidential Candidates In History," by Robert Slimp, Southern Mercury, May/June 2008
"I believe that [Obama's] rhetoric and anti-white legislative proposals would stir up racial riots. If he were running for re-
election, these riots would turn into an exceedingly violent nature that would seriously damage race relations in
America, and leave entire sections of some of our cities in ruins."
--Slimp, May/June 2008
Rep. Joe Wilson could have resigned from the SCV as soon as the organization's takeover by open white supremacists
began. But he didn't. Or he could have withdrawn his membership when the SCV's flagship journal turned into a racist
rag. But he didn't. Instead, while serving as a state senator, Wilson led an SCV-inspired campaign in 2000 to keep the
Confederate flag flying above South Carolina's state capitol. "The Southern heritage, the Confederate heritage, is very
honorable," Wilson <a href=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/503579.stm>proclaimed</a> at the time, responding
to critics of the Confederate flag.

HRC: I wasn't satisfied by my answer to your question about how to gain leverage over the Pakistanis to move them to
more aggressively pursue AQ. I've thought about it some more and, while I have no silver bullet, here are some further
thoughts.
-- My impression is that the Pakistanis have been more cooperative lately in assisting us target some AQ in Pakistan and
that, where they hold back, it is less a function of affinity toward AQ and more about with whom AQ is imbedded..
-- In particular, they seem to be more reluctant to target AQ where it is nestled with groups they want to cultivate in the
event we "leave" Afghanistan and they need influence there. They have seen that before and will hedge their bets.
-- So the first point is that we have to address the reason why they are holding back. If we can disabuse them of the
perception that we are leaving Afghanistan, it will be easier to get the Pakistanis to go after AQ in sanctuaries provided
by groups which would be part of a future Afghanistan dominated by the Taliban.
-- Second, I believe that coercive measures are more likely to be effective if they are targeted against military leaders
who give support to AQ and its allies. Assuming we have adequate intelligence, we can go after bank accounts, travel
and other reachable assets of individual Pakistani officers, raising the stakes for those supporting the militants without
creating an inordinate backlash. Blunter measures of coercion, like conditioning our assistance, are more likely to be
counterproductive. Given the level of distrust for us among the Pakistani people, they would see this as another sharp
swing of the U.S. pendulum which would harden their attitudes and make greater cooperation very difficult for the
Pakistani people to accept.
-- There may be greater leverage in giving the Pakistanis incentives to be more aggressive. Of course, the military's
calculation is most important. I'm not sure what is on their shopping list these days but we would need to balance what
would move the needle on AQ against undercutting our effort to get them to shift their strategic focus away from India..
At the same time, we can be as forward leaning as possible in support of their counterinsurgency capabilities
(equipment, training, whatever material, intelligence and other assistance we can give them if they move into
Wazeristan -- including relief for displaced persons). If they finally take that step, we can do all that is possible to
demonstrate that our arrows are aligned with theirs..
-- On the civilian side, their desire for greater control over how Kerry-Lugar money can be used can be played to our
strategic advantage. If we give them a greater sense that they are directing the use of these funds -- without greatly
undercutting their effectiveness -- it strengthens our position to press them on AQ.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760082 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760082 Date: 06/30/2015
-- Finally, there is the defining relationship with India. Are there measures that the Indians could take that would reduce
Pakistani anxieties about the Indian front and thus better enable them to focus on threats to the East, including both AQ
and anti-Indian militant groups like LET? Are there confidence building measures such as information sharing on troop
movements that would both reduce uncertainty and support a Pakistani public narrative for a shift in emphasis from
India to the militancy? To the extent India seeks to have Pakistan move more vigorously against the militants, they could
see such steps as advancing their interests. This is tricky territory but may be worth pursuing.

I'm at a gathering In Italy on Beijing's unfinished agenda with many of your friends -- a group as diverse as Yunus and
Tina Brown. You have gotten so many plaudits for your honest engagement in Pakistan.
I'm sure it brings back many memories to be in Marrekesh. The women in Morocco have achieved a great deal,
especially with the family code reform -- and they have had the support of the King. The gender initiative idea that is
part of the FFF is still unformed. I think if you say positive things about its potential, it could make a difference for how it
goes forward and we can help.
You make us proud.

I know you're embarked on another big trip and wish you well.
I met with Reema Navatany, Ela Bhatt's right hand, whom you know. She sends her greetings and underscored again
what you mean to them. SEWA is on the cutting edge of so many exciting developments.
We had a great conversation on many things, including how much women in the developing world can and must do to
address climate change and drive low tech green industries. In the villages, I could feel the pollution in my eyes and
throat -- so much needs to be done at the local level. Much pollution is produced because of the way women cook, etc.
When I get back, will work up some ideas on this. Delhi's been enshrouded in smog for the last couple days.
The SEWA project I visited 2 hours outside of Delhi was so impressive. Women who were among the poorst of the poor
had become businesswomen capable of traveling to London and Brussels to negotiate contracts with companies for
their embroidery etc We're going to have SEWA play a key role in the Vital Voices summit that you announced that will
take place here next year.
Maria Otero was still here when - arrived so she joined me for the SEWA mtgs.
I also went to one of Rushira Gupta's antitrafficking projects. You know her as we've been working with her thru WH
years. She got the global citizens award at CGI this year. I don't think I've seen worse conditions than what she's trying to
address. In Mumbai we launched an anti- trafficking campaign with Bollywood which brought in new players to the
cause.
Tomw, I will be speaking on this year's World Economic Forum Gender Gap report for India. There's so much potential
for India's economic growth -- as the WEF points out --- if they'd tap women's potential here. India is last of the BRIC
countries on most indicators and comes out poorly generally. Will be raising some of these issues with govt in Dialogue
mtgs.
Anyway, I thought of you so much everywhere I went. I'm so happy to be part of your legacy on these issues.
Travel well.

I was just talking to Mary Beth Sheridan of the WP, trying to interest her in a story with Eric Schwartz on our concern
about deteriorating conditions in the IDP camps in Sri Lanka. Got her to nibble on that story, but then she asks if it is true
that I told her I had not heard that. Let me know if there
is anything I should do.

Dear Hillary,
I very much hope we have a chance to spend some time with you next week for the "Sanya Initiatove" in DC with four
other American Four Stars and our Chinese counterparts. You will recall this is part of what I've been trying to do under
our "complementary engagement" program, which I briefly mentioned to you.
I understand our offices are working on the schedules, but nothing is firm yet.
Your personal involvement with this group - perhaps a small lunch - would be a very important message seen at the
highest levels of the Chinese government and the Central Military Commission.
I'd be personally grateful not only on behalf of our group, but also on behalf of a cause that I believe will be a part of
leading to a trusting relationship between our militaries so that we will have friends in China - not enemies.
Warm, best regards,
Bill

Dear Melanne,
The US Ambassador to UNESCO is launching a fierce, ferocious, unfair campaign against the Egyptian candidate to
UNESCO Minister Farouk Hosni.
If Washington does not want him â for whatever reasons â this is acceptable as their choice, but we think the US, with
its principles and weight, should be a fair partner and an objective leader.
People here are surprised at the position of the US Ambassador. They say "We want to feel that change is not just a
Motto but starts a new era in our relationship"
Hosni is an open-minded person who respects all religions. He is accused of being Anti-Jewish. That is not true. The
allegation is based on a quote out of context. He is translating Hebrew literature, restored Synagogues and is
establishing a Jewish Museum. He rescued the torah scrolls and has the symbols of the three religions appear together
in Video Clips, Pictures and documentaries about Egypt.
For these, and similar reasons, the fundamental âTerrorists are against him and are the ones working hard to block his
election.
Who wants to be with them in the same basket!!!!

Assume you're in Berlin. Holbrooke just dazzled &, in some key cases, mollified, even persuaded Trilateral Commission re
Afpak. It was off-record. I strongly feel he & others shd be out there publicly establishing the theory of the case, not
least because that will help manage the delay before the Pres's decision/announcement.
Safe travels & hi to Gorby (just kidding--he regards me as a Yeltsinite)

For Secretary Clinton
Dear Hillary,
You will remember our initiative to bring the most senior retired generals from the Chinese and US militaries. With
these 10 generals from the two countires, I am going to be in DC on October 21 and 22. these Generals have been part
our of our Sanya Initiative - the unofficial mil-mil dialogue I started last year. It'll be me, Joe Prueher, Charley Wilhelm,
Ron Fogleman, and Denny Reimer. The Chinese will be led by General Xiong Guangkai and include four other very senior
and respected Generals from the PLA.
The Chinese view this as a formal track one program and take it very seriously. We will meet with ADM Mullen and ADM
Keating in Honolulu and see GEN Cartwright at the Pentagon. It would be a terrific sign of the U.S.'s support for this
relationship if you were able join or host (I'd be pleased to fund) a very private dinner on the evening of the 21 or the
22nd of October. Just you, the Generals, and interpreters - perhaps the Chinese Ambassador if you think that would be
valuable.

I met with Kurt Campbell last month, and we will meet with him and Jim Steinberg. He expressed strong support for this
dialogue as well as the economic one we started in Beijing last August. You know we would welcome involvement from
State at any of our projects - our goal is to make a small but meaningful difference in the relationship.
Warm best wishes, (I'm cheering for you!)

short paper for her staff.

BEIJING, April 29 (Reuters) - A knife-wielding man injured 28 children, two teachers and a security guard in a
kindergarten in eastern China, state media reported on Thursday, the fourth such stabbing case in recent weeks. Xu
Yuyuan, 47, an unemployed local man, broke into a classroom in Taixing city of eastern Jiangsu province on Thursday
morning, attacking the children with a 20 cm long knife, the official Xinhua news agency said. The injured children were
all about four years old, and five are in critical condition, it added. Xu has been jobless since he was fired from a local
insurance company in 2001, and then took part in pyramid selling schemes, Xinhua added. The attack is the fourth
reported school stabbing in China in recent weeks, and the rash of violence has prompted public calls for more measures
to protect students in a country where many couples only have one child. A man stabbed 16 students and a teacher at a
primary school in southern China on Wednesday, the same day that a former doctor was executed for stabbing to death
eight school children last month. "More concrete measures should be taken to make school the safest place," a
commentary in today's Beijing News said, calling for more serve punishment for these killers. Some Chinese people have
taken to the Internet to discuss the root causes of the increasing number of school tragedies

FISA director leaves legacy of collaboration
Breaking down barriers
Wednesday, May 26, 2010
By Tina Calabro, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
Pam Panchak/Post-Gazette
FISA Foundation retiring executive director Dee Delaney, left, with the new executive director, Kristy Trautmann.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769604 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769604 Date: 08/31/2015
To people in the local disability community, Dee Delaney is a household name.
When news came this spring of her intention to retire as executive director of FISA Foundation in August, one could
almost hear a collective gasp. With 14 years at the helm of the small but influential foundation, Ms. Delaney has had a
pronounced and lasting influence on quality of life in our region.
On behalf of FISA, Ms. Delaney has changed the local landscape not only by funding projects with far-reaching results,
but by bringing people together to craft solutions to longstanding problems and by becoming personally involved in
many of the projects the foundation funds.
She became the first executive director of FISA Foundation when it began in 1996 with proceeds from the sale of
Harmarville Rehabilitation Center, a nonprofit, to HealthSouth, a for-profit organization.
The new foundation would continue the mission of the Federation of Independent School Alumnae, an organization that
opened a convalescent home for women in 1911 and the Harmarville Rehabilitation Center in 1954. That mission was to
improve the lives of women, girls and people with disabilities in Western Pennsylvania.
Ms. Delaney, who had been involved with Harmarville since 1980 -- starting as a volunteer and ending as development
director of its foundation -- sought the job of leading FISA. "I realized the impact the foundation could have. FISA is not a
large foundation, but it's a very focused foundation," she said.
Over the past 14 years, FISA's endowment has grown to more than $38 million. Over $17 million has been granted to
726 projects in 298 organizations.
A roll call of projects funded by FISA reflects progressive thinking about including of people with disabilities in all aspects
of life, especially access to health care. Programs have become national models.
Women with disabilities, for example, often encounter barriers in typical healthcare settings. Standard exam tables and
diagnostic equipment were designed for the able-bodied, and medical staff often struggle to accommodate individuals
with special needs. FISA provided the seed money for the Center for Women with Disabilities at Magee-Womens
Hospital of UPMC, one of the first such clinics in the nation. FISA is involved in the overall issue of improving access to
healthcare for people with disabilities.
Likewise, people with disabilities have difficulty obtaining dental care. A FISA-funded project at Achieva is creating
statewide, systemic solutions. FISA also provided support for the Center for Patients with Special Needs at Pitt's School
of Dental Medicine.
FISA has also taken the lead on training arts and cultural venues how to make events more accessible and helping places
of worship more welcoming.
"Dee is a national leader in the field. If there were more people like her, we wouldn't have the issues we have," said Kim
Hutchinson, executive director of the Disability Funders Network, based in Virginia. Ms. Delaney has been a board officer
for the group since 2004.
Nancy Murray, president of the ARC of Greater Pittsburgh, said the issues Ms. Delaney has helped solve are ones that
people have been working on for years.
"People talk about strategies, but never move forward to solutions. Dee brings all the stakeholders together to get to
the solutions," said Ms. Murray.
"I think Dee has greatly influenced the next generation of nonprofit and philanthropic leaders, leading by example on
the value of true collaboration," said Susie Chase, a board member of FISA and former executive director of Working
Order, a FISA grantee.

"With Dee, it is never about her own role, or FISA's role, it is always about unmet needs in the community and the work
that needs to be done. That seems to bring out the best in every partner, and in everyone who has the privilege of
working with her."
Ms. Chase added that advice and technical assistance Ms. Delaney provided to Working Order "were of equal or greater
value to the organization than the grant funds."
"I still, after many years, never come away from a meeting with Dee that I haven't learned something, been inspired to
work harder, and understood more clearly the value of someone else's ideas and efforts."
In her retirement, Ms. Delaney plans to "give back to the community in new ways," she said. A new frontier is helping
young people with disabilities prepare for employment and leadership. "We have to keep the fire burning."
On May 19, FISA announced that Kristy Trautmann, who has served as the foundation's program director for six years,
was promoted to executive director.
"We sought a person who would follow Ms. Delaney's visionary leadership and guide the foundation into the next
decade," said Jane Burger, who chaired the search. committee. "We know that we have found such a person in Kristy
Trautmann. She understands the challenges facing the populations the foundation supports and has the trust of the
board and the community."

War on terror: Obama softened the language, but hardened Muslim hearts
The Obama administration's shift in counterterrorism language sought to bridge the divide with the Muslim world and
soften Americans' fear of Islam. But the new rhetoric hasn't matched policy, and the unintended costs at home and
abroad have been high.
By Stuart Gottlieb <http://www.csmonitor.com/layout/set/print/About/Contact-Us-Feedback>
posted October 14, 2010 at 9:58 am EDT
New Haven, Conn. â
One of the most defining aspects of the Obama administration's counterterrorism strategy has been its effort to change
America's rhetorical approach to the threat of terrorism <http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2009/0129/obama-
redefines-war-on-terror> , particularly Islamic terrorism. "The language we use matters," President Obama told the
Arabic satellite television station Al Arabiya in an interview during his first week in office. Scrubbed were George W.
Bush-era terms like "war on terrorism," "radical Islam," and "jihadist." <http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0901/p03s03-
uspo.html> The White House's 2010 National Security Strategy formally replaced the term "Islamic terrorism" with
"violent extremism."
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771519 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771519 Date: 08/31/2015
The purpose of the shift in semantics was two-fold.
First, it aimed to repackage the fight against terrorism as a specific fight against Al Qaeda, not against Islamic extremism,
which Mr. Obama believes contributed to a post-9/11 perception that America was "at war with Islam." Indeed, the new
rhetoric <http://www.csmonitor.com/World/G lobal-News/2009/0604/in-fra nce-oba ma-erases-the-us-vs-them-
rhetoric> has gone hand in hand with Obama's outreach to the Muslim world
<http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2009/0605/p06s01-wome.html> to build "a new partnership based on
mutual respect and mutual interest."
Second, it was part of a broader effort to soften Americans' fear of Islamic terrorism, which Obama officials believe plays
directly into the hands of extremists.
Language change ineffective
Now it is fair to ask whether Obama's use of language regarding terrorism has proven effective. Startling new polls
suggest it hasn't. The first, by the Brookings Institution in Washington, shows that between May 2009 and May 2010 the
number of Middle Eastern Arabs expressing optimism in Obama's approach toward their region dropped
<http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-News/2010/0806/0bama-s-popularity-may-be-down-in-US-but-he-s-even-
less-popular-among-Arabs> from 51 percent to just 16 percent, with those describing themselves as "discouraged" by
the Obama presidency rising from 15 percent to 63 percent.
The second, by the Pew Research Center, shows that in August 2010 fewer Americans held a favorable view of Islam (30
percent) than five years earlier during the Bush administration (41 percent), with more Americans (35 percent) saying
Islam encourages violence more than other religions (in 2002, it was 25 percent).
These starkly negative trend lines suggest the limited utility of language in fighting terrorism. Yes, terrorism is a
propaganda-fueled activity â an ongoing battle to win hearts and minds <http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-
East/2009/0603/p06s16-wome.html> and attract new recruits to fight for the cause. And of course the language used in
combating terrorism <http://www.csmonitorcom/USA/Foreign-Policy/2008/0801/p02s01-usfp.html> is vital â the
counterproductive "smoke 'em out" rhetoric of the Bush administration <http://www.csmonitor.com/2001/0919/p12s2-
woeu.html> is a case in point.
But if rhetoric does not match policy, or appears to discount or play down threats, the credibility â and thus
effectiveness â of the overall counterterrorism strategy may be undermined. It appears the Obama administration has
dug itself into just such a hole.
Rhetoric doesn't match policy
When looking beyond the nuanced language and appealing promises, what Muslims around the world see is an
administration that has ramped up the war in Afghanistan
<http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0609/0bama-wants-more-money-for-Afghanistan-war.-Will-Congress-
grant-it> ; is killing scores of Muslim civilians with drone strikes <http://www.csmonitor.com/World/terrorism-
security/2010/0915/US-drone-attacks-bombard-Haqqani-network-in-Pakistan> ; continues to hold more than 1,000
Muslim detainees in Guantanamo <http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Topics/Guantanamo>, Bagram, and other prisons;
and maintains seemingly unconditional support of Israel.
This is not to critique these policies, but to point out that they do not match the raised expectations of the Muslim world
and have only muddled Obama's oft-stated goal of turning Muslims toward America and away from extremist
movements.

The price of downplaying the threat
A large price is also being paid domestically for disconnected rhetoric. Despite maintaining nearly all of Bush's hard-line
tactics â the USA Patriot Act <http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0301/0bama-signs-Patriot-Act-extension-
without-reforms> , warrantless surveillance, indefinite detentions â the White House has consistently played down the
threat, even in the face of a clear uptick in terrorism activity.
For example, following the failed 2009 Christmas Day airline bombing
<http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0102/Calling-it-war-Obama-pegs-Christmas-Day-attack-to-Al-Qaeda> ,
Obama described the suspect as an "isolated extremist," despite his ties to Al Qaeda. And the administration's initial
response to the failed May 2010 Times Square bombing <http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2010/0509/Times-Square-
bombing-Sign-of-desperation-from-Pakistan-Taliban> by an American Muslim trained in Pakistan was to call it a "one-
off" event. Attorney General Eric Holder stated <http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2010/0203/Holder-letter-why-
we-read-Christmas-Day-bomber-his-rights> in congressional testimony that he believed these and other recent Islamic
terror plots were unconnected, and unrelated to radical Islam.
There is little doubt that the administration's unwillingness to speak candidly about Islamic terrorism has taken a toll on
the public's trust. A Gallup poll released last month shows Americans favoring Republicans over Democrats on the issue
of terrorism 55 percent to 31 percent â up from 49 percent to 42 percent last fall.
Time to reverse the trend
Obama entered office promising to fight a smarter and more effective war on terrorism, and in many ways he has. His
instincts to maintain aggressive tactics while toning down inflammatory rhetoric
<http://www.csmonitorcom/2006/0517/p09s01-cojh.html> were sound. Yet his administration seems to have
overlearned a key lesson of the Bush years â that overstating the threat of terrorism
<http://www.csmonitorcom/2007/0418/p04s01-woeu.html> has costs attached. So, too, does rhetoric that
understates the threat, especially when detached from policy.
It is not too late to reverse this troubling trend. The White House can begin by focusing less on overly reassuring rhetoric
â which has not paid dividends at home or abroad â and more on a candid accounting of the threats faced
<http://www.csmonitorcom/2006/0905/p14s02-bogn.html> and the policies employed to confront them.

The new year is bound to bring in a continuing wave of crisis around the world. Consider this photo a momentary
respite. It is evocative of the good feeling you engender everywhere. The photo is of the Director of New Life Center in
Chiang Mai. They are doing incredible work there and have made exceptional progress since your visit. They remember
you with great gratitude. I had one of your signed photos left after distributing the others to the Burmese women
human rights leaders (who also felt that you were on their side).
Everywhere I went over the holidays, there was much favorable comment about your leadership. I'm so proud to be
back working with you. Because you've created such ripples of hope, we've got so much to do!
Love to all the Clintons and best wishes for a healthy, happy, productive and rewarding New Year.

BEIJING, April 29 (Reuters) - A knife-wielding man injured 28 children, two teachers and a security guard in a
kindergarten in eastern China, state media reported on Thursday, the fourth such stabbing case in recent weeks. Xu
Yuyuan, 47, an unemployed local man, broke into a classroom in Taixing city of eastern Jiangsu province on Thursday
morning, attacking the children with a 20 cm long knife, the official Xinhua news agency said. The injured children were
all about four years old, and five are in critical condition, it added. Xu has been jobless since he was fired from a local
insurance company in 2001, and then took part in pyramid selling schemes, Xinhua added. The attack is the fourth
reported school stabbing in China in recent weeks, and the rash of violence has prompted public calls for more measures
to protect students in a country where many couples only have one child. A man stabbed 16 students and a teacher at a
primary school in southern China on Wednesday, the same day that a former doctor was executed for stabbing to death
eight school children last month. "More concrete measures should be taken to make school the safest place," a
commentary in today's Beijing News said, calling for more serve punishment for these killers. Some Chinese people have
taken to the Internet to discuss the root causes of the increasing number of school tragedies

So if we begin start on tuesday night there is a way to get both measures done by the weekend. We will keep working it
with Reid staff and floor staff over the weekend. If you have any reason to speak with Durbin (he's on sunday shows) or

One START update: new START remains in the mix for next week, but when it will be fit into the schedule is not firmly

opponents require the use of all 30 hours, post-cloture, they will finish the tax bill on Tuesday evening. It is possible
that new START will then be the next order of business. But that hasn't been decided yet. They could turn to the
