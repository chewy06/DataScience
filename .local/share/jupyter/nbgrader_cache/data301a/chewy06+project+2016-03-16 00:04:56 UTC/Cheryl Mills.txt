Anti-Muslim film director in hiding, following
Libya, Egypt violence
By Nia-Malika Henderson and Michelle Boorstein, Updated: Wednesday, September 12,
1:30 PM
The director of a controversial anti-Islam film has gone into hiding, according to reports, fearing reprisals over a
work that has sparked violence in Egypt and Libya and led to the deaths of four Americans.
Sam Bacile, a California real estate developer, posted a 13-minute clip of "The Innocence of Muslims," in July,
and the film became a lighting rod after the Egyptian media began showing parts of it on air and dubbed
versions of the English-language film appeared on the Internet.
It depicts the Prophet Muhammad as a bumbling idiot, born out of wedlock and making up verses to the Islamic
holy book to suit his purposes and desires. The film also shows him as having intimate relations with women
and suggests that he was gay.
Any flesh-and-blood depiction of Muhammad is offensive to Muslims.
"This is a political movie," Bacile, 56, told the Associated Press, adding that he didn't expect the film to spark
such fury. "The U.S. lost a lot of money and a lot of people in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but we're fighting
with ideas."
Bacile identified himself to several news organizations as an Israeli-born Jew who works as a real estate
developer in California. Yet his identity remains something of a mystery—Bacile is not listed in any directories
or incorporations or real estate deeds and is not licensed in California as a real estate broker. And Israeli
authorities told the Associated Press that they don't have any records of Bacile.

There are also questions about whether the film sparked the violence in Libya, which according to some reports
seemed to be more coordinated than the protests in Egypt where some 2,000 gathered outside the U.S. Embassy
in Cairo.
The eruption of violence came around the llth anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks, as Americans paused
to remember the 3,000 people who lost their lives.
Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three others were killed after protesters attacked the U.S. consulate in
Benghazi.
Nihad Awad, national executive director of the Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations
(CAIR), condemned both the killings and the film. Awad said in a statement:
"We urge that this ignorant attempt to provoke the religious feelings of Muslims in the Arabic-speaking world
be ignored and that its extremist producers not be given the cheap publicity they so desperately seek.
"Those who created this trashy film do not represent the people of America or the Christian faith. The only
proper response to intentional provocations such as this film is to redouble efforts to promote mutual
understanding between faiths and to marginalize extremists of all stripes."
A controversial Florida pastor was among those promoting "The Innocence of Muslims," which cost $5 million
to make and stars amateur actors, some of whom appear to be wearing make-up to darken their faces.
Bacile said that the film was backed by 100 Jewish donors, according to Bacile.
Among the promoters is Morris Sadek, who heads the National American Cooptic Assembly and the Rev. Terry
Jones, leader of a small group that holds virulently anti-Islam events.
Tuesday evening, Jones sent out a press release blaming the Muslim faith for the protests and saying the group
would be running a trailer later in the evening for the film.
The trailer was part of a one-to-two hour "live event" that Jones was doing from his Gainesville center for Sept.
11, said Fran Ingram, a spokeswoman for his group, Stand Up America. The whole broadcast included the
handlebar-moustached pastor in a black "infidel" t-shirt standing in front of a fabric lynched devil dressed in a
white turban for what they group dubbed "International Judge Muhammed Day."
It wasn't clear if Jones, who garnered worldwide attention in recent years with his threats to burn the Koran,
had promoted "The Innocence of Muslims" before the rioting began.
Asked if Jones was connected in any way with the making of the film, Ingram said she couldn't comment.

Secretary of State Hillary Rodharn Clinton on Thursday tried to distance the U.S.
government from a movie that has sparked protests throughout the Muslim world,
calling it "disgusting and reprehensible" but also condemning efforts to avenge the
movie through bloodshed.

"The U.S. government has absolutely nothing to do with this video. We absolutely
reject its content and messages," Clinton said. "But there is no justification none
at all — for responding to this video with violence."
Clinton spoke two days after U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three
other Americans were killed at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, an attack
that analysts was staged by militants to coincide with a demonstration against the
controversial movie. Protests denouncing the film have raged outside the U.S
Embassy in Egypt for three days, and demonstrators on Tuesday breached the walls
of that heavily guarded compound, pulled down an American flag and destroyed it.
In Sanaa, Yemen, hundreds of demonstrators converged on a usually-sealed-off
street in front of the embassy on Thursday for a protest that also turned violent,
witnesses said. Protesters stormed a wall, set fire to a building inside the compound,
broke windows and carried away office supplies and other souvenirs before being
pushed back and dispersed by Yemeni security forces.
"We want to expel the American ambassador," said Abdelwadood al-Mutawa, a
protester who was walking out of the embassy compound. He said he was
motivated by reports of the movie mocking the prophet Muhammad. "We cannot
accept any insult to our prophet," Mutawa said. "It's a red line."
Another protester said that some of the security forces protecting the building
appeared sympathetic to the demonstrators' cause. "Some soldiers were telling me,
'These are dogs, and we cannot accept insulting our prophet,' "said Yusef
Mohammad.
Smaller protests were reported in front of diplomatic offices in Iran and outside a
mosque in Bangladesh.
Yemen's president, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, quickly issued an apology to the
United States, and ordered an investigation into incident.
"The Government of Yemen condemns any and all acts of violence against
diplomatic personnel and facilities," a statement from Yemen's government said.
"We strongly urge all those that would wish to incite others to violence to cease
immediately."
But the violence in Yemen again raised questions about whether vulnerable Middle
East governments are willing or even able to protect American targets in their

countries. It was a further measure of the depth of anger about the film insulting the
prophet Muhammad, which was reportedly made in California, although much
about its origins remains unknown.
President Obama spoke by phone with Libyan President Mohamed Yusuf al-
Magariaf late Wednesday, accepting condolences for the American deaths in
Benghazi and expressing appreciation for the cooperation between the United States
and the people and government of Libya in the wake of the attack, the White House
said.
In Brussels, meanwhile, Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi on Thursday gave his
strongest condemnation yet of the attack on the Cairo embassy. He had issued only
tepid statements on Wednesday, and his Muslim Brotherhood organization had
called for further protests in front of the diplomatic compound.
Morsi said he condemned the security breach "in the clearest terms."
"I assured Barack Obama that we will not permit any attacks" on U.S. diplomatic
compounds across Egypt, said Morsi, who is in Belgium for a visit to the European
Union.
But Morsi also denounced the anti-Islamic film that appears to have sparked many
of the protests, adding that he had spoken to Obama about it. "I called him to ask
him to put an end to such behavior," Morsi said, referring to the making of the film.
In her remarks, made in Washington during an appearance with the Moroccan
foreign minister, Clinton said the United States cannot and should not prevent
people from making films that express their opinions. Doing so, she emphasized,
would violate the country's staunch commitment to free and open speech.
"Now I know it is hard for some people to understand why the United States cannot
or does not just prevent these kinds of reprehensible videos from ever seeing the
light of day," Clinton said. "... Even if it were possible, our country does have a
long tradition of free expression, which is enshrined in our Constitution and our
law. And we do not stop individual citizens from expressing their views, no matter
how distasteful they may be."
Noting that countless generations of immigrants, including "millions of Muslims"
have left other countries for the United States in order to enjoy those same

freedoms, Clinton repeatedly denounced violent responses to offensive speech. She
called on other world leaders to do the same.
"We all -- whether we are leaders in goverment, leaders in civil society or
religious leaders -- must draw the line at violence," Clinton said. "And any
responsible leader should be standing up now and drawing that line."
In Cairo on Thursday, security forces eventually pushed the demonstrators away
from the U.S. Embassy onto Tahrir Square — the crucial site of Egypt's 2011
revolution.
In Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, about 100 demonstrators burned an American
flag and chanted slogans on Thursday, including "We won't accept mocking of
Prophet Muhammad" and "Down with American imperialism," Agence France
Press reported.
The news agency said the protesters were mostly seminary student. They gathered
outside the Baitul Mokarram Mosque, the largest in the country, but called for more
protests Friday and said the U.S. embassy could be the target. Bangladeshi police
told AFP that security at the embassy was being enhanced.
In Tehran, anti-American protesters gathered outside the Swiss Embassy, which

American Killed in Libya Was on Intel Mission to Track Weapons
Before Death, Ex-SEAL Glen Doherty Told ABC News He Helped Round Up Dangerous
Shoulder-Fired Rockets
By LEE FERRAN
Sept. 13,2012
One of the Americans killed alongside Ambassador Christopher Stevens in an attack on a U.S. diplomatic
mission in Libya Tuesday told ABC News before his death that he was working with the State Department
on an intelligence mission to round up dangerous weapons in the war-torn nation.
In an interview with ABC News last month, Glen Doherty, a 42-year-old former Navy SEAL who worked as
a contractor with the State Department, said he personally went into the field to track down so-called
MANPADS, shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, and destroy them. After the fall of dictator Moammar
Gadhafi last year, the State Department launched a mission to round up thousands of MANPADS that may
have been looted from military installations across the country. U.S. officials previously told ABC
News they were concerned the MANPADS could fall into the hands of terrorists, creating a threat to
commercial airliners.

Doherty said that he traveled throughout Libya chasing reports of the weapons and once they were found,
his team would destroy them on the spot by bashing them with hammers or repeatedly running them over
with their vehicles. When ABC News spoke to Doherty in late August, he was enjoying a short time off in
California before heading back to Libya just days ago.

The State Department declined to comment on Doherty's involvement in the IVIANPADS program, but
pointed to a previous statement from State Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs Andrew
Shapiro in which he said the department was looking at "every possible tool to mitigate the threat."
According to military records provided to ABC News, Doherty joined the Navy in 1996 and was a combat
medic and a decorated member of the elite SEAL teams by the time he left active duty in 2004. He's
described in glowing terms as a top-tier SEAL and better friend in the book "The Red Circle," written by
Doherty's longtime friend and SEAL sniper school partner, Brandon Webb.
"Glen was a superb and respected operator, a true quiet professional," Webb told ABC News today. "Don't
feel sorry for him, he wouldn't have it. He died serving with men he respected, protecting the freedoms we
enjoy as Americans and doing something he loved. He was my best friend and one of the finest human
beings I've ever known."
Doherty's mother, Barbara, told ABC News' Boston affiliate WCVB she had been notified of her son's death
late Wednesday.
"He was the most wonderful person," she said. "We are all in pain and suffering."
Ambassador Stevens and State Department information management officer Sean Smith were killed in the
first wave of attacks in Benghazi when the building they were in was set on fire around 10 p.m. local time
Tuesday, a senior administration official told reporters. Doherty was apparently one of two other
Americans who were killed in a firefight nearly two hours later, while the facility was still under attack.

OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR
In Libya and Elsewhere, Our Diplomats Deserve Better
By PRUDENCE BUSHNELL
Published: September 14, 2012
Falls Church, Va.
THERE is a black wall in a State Department lobby inscribed with the names of those who died while serving overseas.
Every time I passed that wall after Al Qaeda blew up two American Embassies in East Africa in 1998, I thought of the 12
American and 32 Kenyan friends and colleagues who died on my watch as ambassador. I thought of my own journey
that day down flights of stairs in the building next door to the embassy, after having been knocked out by the blast, of
the people who risked their lives to save others and of how we carried on under horrendous circumstances
Now every time I pass the black marble wall, I will think of Ambassador a Christopher Stevens and his colleagues who
died after an attack on our consulate in Benghazi, Libya, this week,
Diplomats don't often make headlines until something horrible happens. Even then, it is policy and politics that get the
attention. We had barely learned of the attack before talking heads began to expound on Middle East policies and the
words administration officials used or should have used, to uphold our national dignity. Where were the conversations
about the diplomats who were actually carrying out those policies in faraway, often dangerous places, the people who
take care of us despite the hardship and risk? Imagine what it must have been like trying to escape the raging fire in the
Benghazi consulate or enduring hours of assault in the nearby annex waiting for relief from the Libyan government.
Diplomacy is a dangerous profession. You cannot exert influence by whispering in diplomatic code to your government
counterparts behind closed doors. You do not spread American values - especially in places where passions are high,
governments fragile and guns plentiful - by remote control from Washington. You have to get out from behind the walls
and engage with people. We know this can put us in harm's way; our people in the Benghazi consulate knew it. And they
did their jobs anyway.
That is because, hokey as it sounds, the people who represent us overseas really do believe they can make a difference.
They confront violent behavior and strong passions with American leadership, smart power and peaceful means.
We must make that work safer. The reasons for violence change with time and place but the human effects are the
same. For two years before we were blown up in Nairobi, Kenya, my team and I fought ("nagged" was the word State
Department colleagues used) to have security threats and vulnerabilities addressed. We were too close to the street, an
easy target. Washington's assessment was that things were 0.1e, Anyway, I was told, there was no money for a more
secure embassy. What was Washington's assessment of our consulate in Benghazi? We may not like the image of
American diplomats working out of fortified boxes, but we cannot let them work in buildings that can be overrun by
attackers. This is a lesson our government still hasn't learned since 1979 in Tehran,
If the Benghazi tragedy traces the same journey we made from the rubble in Nairobi, heartfelt pronouncements will be
made; the dead will be given due homage and then they will be buried. The press will alight on other stories. A
Congressionally mandated accountability review board will determine what happened and what needs to be done to

avoid such tragedies in the future. Easy fixes changes to emergency action plans, minor security upgrades - will be
made; expensive and hard ones will not.
The Foreign Service is short on people, and those people are rushed into the field short on training. We build concrete
fortresses when we have to, but we don't invest in the mobile communications and security technology that would
protect diplomats when they leave the embassy, as they must. What kinds of technology, systems, training and
deployment do we need to get results through diplomacy in the 21st century? These are the difficult questions that will
remain unanswered, while diplomats disappear from public view once again. Until the next time someone dies - then we
see the same sorry response all over again.
But we can give meaning to this tragedy. What if President Obama and Mitt Romney exercised true leadership by
explaining to Americans, including the families and friends of those who died in Benghazi, what diplomacy is all about?
Why using words and deeds for peace is as important as using weapons. Why we value our diplomats and what we will
do to make their jobs easier, if we cannot guarantee their absolute security.
It is a stretch, I know. Far easier to add some more concrete, declare our responsibilities to diplomats complete and
move back to the fun stuff of making and debating policy, most of it domestic. The black wall will continue to
accumulate names, diplomats will continue to represent our country on the cheap and nothing much will change. Like
that scenario? If not, start demanding leadership. That is what Chris Stevens and his team were providing. Let's think
about them and reciprocate.

A diplomat under fire.
With the presidential campaign drowning in boredom, commentators were desperately
searching for news, preferably a new victim, to brighten their days. And along came Susan
Rice. A couple Sundays ago, the U.N. ambassador made the mistake of appearing on the talk
shows to insist that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, was "spontaneous"
rather than a terrorist plot. You would have thought she had said that the pope was a
Mormon.
Out came the Washington daggers. She lied. She was a shill. Benghazi was no spontaneous
event. It was the work of an al Qaeda offshoot. The White House had fumbled key
intelligence information and was now trying to cover up its unforgivable mistake. Rice was
just covering up for the president. Her reward would be Obama's nominating her to succeed
Hillary Clinton as secretary of State.
The commentariat immediately rolled out plans to nail Rice and the Obama team to the
wall. Peter King, the Grand Inquisitor of the Republicans in the House of Representatives,
pledged to "investigate" and hold hearings. And that, said the commentariat, would be the
end of Rice's hopes to become the new Hillary.

Now, let's take an unfashionable step back and examine the facts, such as they are. Rice did
not make up the "spontaneous" story or have it handed to her by White House conspirators.
She got it from the same daily intelligence brief given to the president. Those daily intel
reports told the very story Rice repeated publicly, i.e., that the Benghazi mob formed more
or less on its own, mainly in reaction to the American video cartooning sacred Muslim
figures, and that extremists then took advantage to kill, including Ambassador Christopher
Stevens. Rice didn't make up that story. The problem was not with Rice; it was with the
inevitably complicated U.S. intelligence process.
Her mistake was taking the initial intelligence at face value. The White House biiefers made
the same error, and so did I. I too repeated in an op-ed on The Daily Beast what the
intelligence briefers told me, but I knew very well that more and contradictory information
would appear soon enough. It always does.
Sure, the CIA had additional intel from the start, but it hadn't begun to sift through all the
communications intercepts, satellite photos, and human reports. It always takes time to sort
out facts from fictions and find consistent threads. Seemingly, this gossamer information is
now taking shape.
Meantime, Rice is still very much in the running for the job at Fogg' Bottom, along with
Senator John Kerry, NSC Adviser Tom Donilon, and former diplomat Nicholas Burns, now
of Harvard. She was Obama's earliest loyalist in the foreign-policy crowd, and he still likes
her, despite lackluster reports on her performance at the U.N. The smears, though flatly
inaccurate, won't help her either. What will help her and, more importantly a flagging
Obama after the first debate, is hunting down the Benghazi culprits.

Pm Just Speaking For Myself, Former President Says
By SUZAN CLARICE
April 3, 2011 —
Former U.S. President Bill Clinton said he thinks the United States should consider arming the rebels in Libya's
civil war.
"It would depend ... and I might need to know a little more, but I would be inclined to do it," Clinton told
correspondent Bianna Golodryga today in San Diego during an exclusive interview with ABC News.
Clinton was in San Diego for his annual Clinton Global Initiative University Meeting.
The uprising in Libya stared in February during a wave of social and political unrest in the Middle East.
Fighting has escalated all across the country, but the rebels have found themselves outgunned by Libyan leader
Col. Moamrnar Gadhafi's forces, which are better equipped.
Last month the United Nations authorized a no-fly zone over the North African nation to prevent further attacks
on civilians from Gadhafiss troops in the air.
Clinton on Arming Rebels: 'I Sure Wouldn't Shut the Door to It'
The United States backed the no-fly zone and has also authorized additional support for the anti-Gad hafi
fighters, but key U.S. lawmakers and top officials in the government of President Barack Obanaa have said they
are not comfortable with arming the rebels -- apparently because not enough is known about then
But Clinton said he wouldn't completely rule out the idea of supplying arms to Libya's rebels.

"Let me just say this. I sure wouldn't shut the door to it. I think ... we may need to know a little more," he said.
Clinton, husband of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, stressed that he was speaking without "any official
sanction" whatsoever.
"I'm just speaking from myself. But I certainly wouldn't take that off the table, too," he said.

Romney to compare Benghazi to original 9/11 attacks
Posted: 07 Oct 2012 05:01 PM PDT
I 13
In a speech Monday, former Governor Mitt Romneywill criticize President Barack Obama's handling of the
Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi and say it was probably the work of al Qaeda, the same group
that brought down the World Trade Center and struck the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001.
"The attacks on America last month should not be seen as random acts. They are expressions of a larger struggle
that is playing out across the broader Middle East -- a region that is now in the midst of the most profound upheaval
in a century. And the fault lines of this struggle can be seen clearly in Benghazi itself," Romney will say in a foreign-
policy-focused address at the Virginia Military Institute, according to excerpts released by his campaign.
"The attack on our consulate in Benghazi on Sept. nth, 2012, was likely the work of the same forces that attacked
our homeland on Sept. uth, 2001. This latest assault cannot be blamed on a reprehensible video insulting Islam,
despite the administration's attempts to convince us of that for so long. No, as the administration has finally
conceded, these attacks were the deliberate work of terrorists who use violence to impose their dark ideology on

others, especially women and girls; who are fighting to control much of the Middle East today; and who seek to
wage perpetual war on the West?
Some in the U.S. intelligence community believe that the attack on the Benghazi consulate that killed Amb.
Chris Stevens and three other Americans was led by the Benghazi chapter of Ansar al-Sharia, an extremist group
thought to have ties to Al Qaecla in the Islamic Magreb (AQIM), al Qaeda's North Africa affiliate.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton suggested that groups with links to AQIM were responsible for the Beghazi
attack in remarks at a UN. meeting on Sept. 26, but Stale Department and White House spokepersons have
repeated again and again that the precise identity of the attackers remains unknown pending an FBI investigation.
Romney will invoke the original Oa attacks as part of his argument that Obama has failed to respond to the rapid
changes in the Middle East with a proactive and coherent strategy to preserve American power and influence in the
region.
"I know the president hopes for a safer, freer, and a more prosperous Middle East allied with the United States. I
share this hope. But hope is not a strategy," Romney will say. "We cannot support our friends and defeat our
enemies in the Middle East when our words are not backed up by deeds, when our defense spending is being
arbitrarily and deeply cut, when we have no trade agenda to speak of, and the perception of our strategy is not one
of partnership, but of passivity.— It is time to change come in the Middle East."
Romney will promise to increase and tighten sanctions against Iran, permanently base one aircraft carrier group
each in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Gulf, condition aid to Egypt, and "recommit America to the goal of a
democratic, prosperous Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with the Jewish state of Israel."
On Syria, Romney will promise to identify opposition groups that share American values and make sure they get
weapons to defeat the Syrian regime's tanks, helicopters, and fighter jets. He won't say that the United States should
arm the rebels directly only that it should make sure they get advanced weaponry.
On Afghanistan, Romney will accuse Obama of timing the withdrawal of U.S. forces based on political
considerations, a reference to the fact that °halite withdrew all 30,000 "surge" forces last month. But Romney will
reiterate his call to complete the withdrawal of combat troops by the end of 2014, so long as the conditions on the
ground permit and in consultation with the military chain of command.
"I believe that if America does not lead, others will -- others who do not share our interests and our values -- and the
world will grow darker, for our friends and for us. America's security and the cause of freedom cannot afford four
more years like the last four years," Romney will say. 'The 21st century can and must be an American century. It
began with terror, war, and economic calamity. It is our duty to steer it onto the path of freedom, peace, and
prosperity."
The Romney campaign held a conference call for reporters Sunday to preview the speech, which included
participation by campaign foreign-policy coordinator Alex Wongand senior advisors Rich Williamson and
Eliot Cohen.

Wong said that Mama has stepped away from American leadership and undermined the basis of American power.
He also said the standing of the United States has been weakened in every region of the world, and likened Obaina's
foreign policy to that of former President Jimmy Carter.
Williamson said that Mama has a policy of weakness that is provocative to enemies and that his administration
hasn't been transparent on the Benghazi attacks.
"The foreign policy of Barack Obama in the Middle East is a mess and is failing, and that should be a part of the
discussion," Williamson said
The Mama campaign preemptively released a statement calling Romney a neophyte and flip-flopper on foreign
policy who has fumbled his forays into foreign-policy issues throughout the campaign.
"If Mitt Romney wants to have a debate about foreign policy, we have a message for him: bring it on... To date, all
Mitt Romney has offered is bluster and platitudes. He's erratically shifted positions on every major foreign policy
issue, including intervening in Libya, which he was against before he was for," Obama for America spokeswoman
LizSmith said in the statement,
"'Mainstream' foreign policy isn't what Mitt Romneyis putting forward: having plans to start wars but not end
them; wanting to keep so,000 U.S. troops in Iraq indefinitely; exploding our defense spending to levels the
Pentagon has not asked for, with no way to pay for it; insulting our allies and partners around the world on the
campaign trail; and calling Russia our number-one geopolitical foe. If that's where Mitt Romney thinks the
mainstream is, he needs to find a better compass. It's clear that on every measure, Mitt Romney fails the
commander-in-chief test."

Hey, have you had any Q's on this? If so, what are you saying? -E
VS intelligence warned embassy in Egypt of concern,
about anti-Nluslirn film
By Suzanne Kelly
Concerned about the reaction to an anti-Muslim film that was gaining attention online, the U.S. intelligence
community sent a cable to the embassy in Egypt warning of the concern, a U.S. official told CNN. It was sent
48 hours before the protests in Cairo and Benghazi in Libya, the official said
The cable did not discuss any specific threat, the official said. It warned instead about the existence of the
movie being posted on the hamlet and the fact that it was gaining attention. A seven minute portion of the
movie aired on an Egyptian TV talk show the weekend before the protests started, according to a Department of
Homeland Security/Federal Bureau of Intelligence memo obtained by CNN on Thursday.
The cable was not sent to the embassy in Tripoli, Libya or the consulate in Benghazi. US officials have said
there was no intelligence ahead of the attack in Benghazi, which intelligence officials still believe was not
planned. The White House spokesman Jay Carney said Friday there was no "actionable intelligence" indicating
an attack was being planned.
There are hundreds if not thousands of cables sent each day, the official said, and there was no specific threat
attached to this one, because a specific threat was not known

Issa targets Hillary: Big mistake
By Brent Budowsky - 10/10/12 04:03 PM ET
Don't miss the story in The Hill "Issa closes in on Clinton" about Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) aiming at his
biggest target yet, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The story is correct. The Issa strategy will backfire. It will
prove to be a disaster. House Republicans, whose brand is not exactly soaring with voters, are making a huge
mistake using congressional hearings as a partisan weapon to exploit a national tragedy to attack one of the
most admired and respected public servants in the nation.
There is now an independent and nonpartisan investigation of exactly what happened in Libya. A partisan
witch-hunt by Republicans using taxpayer money against Secretary Clinton, as a partisan weapon in the closing
days of an election, to exploit a tragedy to score political points is exactly what the American people believe
has gone wrong with Washington, and is exactly why the Republican brand is in such disrepute with many
voters.
Many independent voters will be offended. Many female voters will be offended. Many voters tired of their
taxpayer money being wasted for political shenanigans will be offended.

Dear Colleagues,
S/E Chris Stevens provided the following update from Benghazi at 1200 EDT to Embassy Tripoli DCM
Polaschik and NEA/MAG Director Roebuck:
Traffic accident: Following discussions with S/E Stevens and other USG officials, the TNC has
agreed not to issue any public statement regarding the accident. S/E Stevens' USG
colleagues are waiting for guidance from their HQ regarding proposed compensation of
52,000 Libyan dinars ($43,312): 13,000 ($10,828) per victim, to cover funeral costs and other
compensation. TNC will accompany S/E Stevens on his courtesy calls on the families, to take
place either today or tomorrow. In the view of S/E Stevens, the TNC has been handling this
incident in a professional and low-profile manner.
[Note: S/E Stevens separately provided the following details of the accident: The U.S. vehicle
was traveling back from the Benghazi airport at moderate speed. The U.S. vehicle was struck
by the Libyan vehicle going at high speed in an intersection. As a correction to earlier
information - four people were killed and only two were injured.]
Police chief: S/E Stevens met with the Benghazi chief of police today, following discussions
related to the accident. The police chief is a university professor who took on these police
duties after the revolution. According to the police chief, there are only 3,000 police in the
Benghazi area, down from 6,000 prior to the revolution. Many police simply did not return to
their jobs after the revolution, as they feared retaliation. EU and UK reps have met with the

chairing a local donor coordination working group on security issues.
TNC aoverning capacity: Following up on concerns raised by the UK Envoy regarding the
TNC's governing capacities, S/E Stevens said that there are indeed gaps in the TNC's structure
and services, as well as some concerns regarding PM-equivalent Mahmoud _fibril's prolonged
absences from Benghazi. However, the TNC is taking steps to address these concerns. The
Council is holding meetings this week to appoint Ministers-equivalent for Interior and Justice,
and will hold its first cabinet meetings this weekend (April 30-May 1) after Jibril returns from
abroad. While S/E Stevens shares the UK's concerns regarding the INC's governing
capacities, he does not think there is a need yet to address this directly with the INC. SiE
Stevens recommends that we wait to see how the INC addresses these issues over the next
week.

Libyan Ambassador's Death Not a Political Issue, Says Dad
By Margaret Talev on October 14, 2012
BusinessWeek
Bloomberg News
The father of Christopher Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya who was killed in the attack in Benghazi last month, said
his son's death shouldn't be politicized in the presidential campaign.
"it would really be abhorrent to make this into a campaign issue," Jan Stevens, 77, said in a telephone interview from his
home in Loomis, California, as he prepares for a memorial service for his son next week.
Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, has criticized President Barack Obama for not providing adequate security in
Libya, saying the administration has left the country exposed to a deadly terrorist attack.
The ambassador's father, a lawyer, said politicians should await the findings of a formal investigation before making
accusations or judgments.
"The security matters are being adequately investigated," Stevens said. "We don't pretend to be experts in security. It
has to be objectively examined. That's where it belongs. It does not belong in the campaign arena." Stevens said he has
been getting briefings from the State Department on the progress of the investigation.
'Very Optimistic'
Stevens said while he was close with his son, "we weren't that familiar with the day-to-day activities' he undertook in
Libya. On the occasions when his son called home, Stevens said, he didn't share many details about his work other than
to say that "he was very optimistic about the results of the election and the new government." They last spoke by phone
in August and by e-mail days before his son's death.

Stevens, a registered Democrat, said he isn't politically active. He declined to say how he'll vote in the presidential
election.
He said his son, who was a career diplomat and had worked for Republican and Democratic presidents, hadn't expressed
concerns to him about security or support from the administration. "He felt very strongly about Secretary Clinton,"
Stevens said, referring to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. "He felt she was an extremely able person."
As for whether he had the tools and protection he needed for his job, Stevens said of his son: "We didn't get into that"
sort of discussion. "I never heard him say a critical word about the State Department or the administration, or any
administration for that matter. He came up through the foreign service, not politics."
Obama Call
Stevens said neither of the two presidential campaigns reached out to him, and that he is grateful for that. He said
Obama telephoned him after his son's death to express his regrets and talk about identifying the perpetrators who
should be brought to justice, and that the conversation was in the context of his presidential duties and not political.
While polls indicate that voters say Obama would do a better job on foreign policy issues, Republicans see an
opportunity to cut into that advantage, pointing to surveys showing that voters have grown less satisfied since the Sept.
11 assault in Libya.
Stevens stopped short of directly criticizing either candidate.
"I'm not sure exactly what he's been saying and not saying, but our position is it would be a real shame if this were
politicized," Stevens said, referring to Romney. "Our concern now is memorializing Chris and remembering his
contribution to the country."
Campaign Shift
Romney's current foreign policy position marks a shift in tone from a campaign that has focused almost exclusively on
economic issues and jobs.
The Romney team is attempting to link two campaign messages by charging Obama with weakening American interests
abroad at the same time as he's failed to boost the economy back home.
Speaking to voters on Oct. 12 in Richmond, Virginia, Romney chastised Vice President Joe Biden for his defense of the
administration's actions in the Libya attack.
"He's doubling down on denial, and we need to understand exactly what happened as opposed to just having people
brush this aside," Romney said.
During last week's vice presidential debate, Biden said the White House wasn't told of a request for additional security
at the mission in Benghazi the month before the incident.
State Department official Eric Nordstrom, who served as a regional security officer in Tripoli until July, told a
congressional committee that he was turned down when he requested an extension of a 16-member security support
team that was scheduled to leave Libya in August.

Romney hasn't specified what he would do differently than the administration in Libya. In a speech at the Virginia
Military Institute earlier last week, he called for support of Libya's "efforts to forge a lasting government" and to pursue
the "terrorists who attacked our consulate."
That view is at odds with the position Romney took more than a year ago, when he opposed expanding the intervention
in Libya to capture Muammar Qaddafi, calling it "mission creep and mission muddle" in April 2011.
Neither the administration's initial public report that the attack began with a spontaneous demonstration against an
anti- Islamic video clip nor Republican suggestions that it was a planned attack tied to al-Qaeda are supported by U.S.
intelligence reports or by accounts of the night provided to a Bloomberg reporter by Benghazi residents.
White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters that "the president wants to get to the bottom of what
happened."
Carney also sought to minimize questions about why the president and other administration officials were slow to
publicly acknowledge the role of terrorism in the attack.
"As time went on, additional information became available," Carney said. "Clearly, we know more today than we did on
the Sunday after the attack. But as the process moves forward and more information becomes available, we will be sure
to continue consulting with you."

Libyan Ambassador's Death Not a Political Issue, Says Dad
By Margaret Taley on October 14, 2012
BusinessWeek
Bloomberg News
The father of Christopher Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya who was killed in the attack in Benghazi last month, said
his son's death shouldn't be politicized in the presidential campaign,
"It would really be abhorrent to make this into a campaign issue," Jan Stevens, 77, said in a telephone interview from his
home in Loomis, California, as he prepares for a memorial service for his son next week.
Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, has criticized President Barack Obama for not providing adequate security in
Libya, saying the administration has left the country exposed to a deadly terrorist attack.

The ambassador's father, a lawyer, said politicians should await the findings of a formal investigation before making
accusations or judgments.
"The security matters are being adequately investigated," Stevens said. "We don't pretend to be experts in security. It
has to be objectively examined. That's where it belongs. It does not belong in the campaign arena." Stevens said he has
been getting briefings from the State Department on the progress of the investigation.
'Very Optimistic'
Stevens said while he was close with his son, "we weren't that familiar with the day-to-day activities" he undertook in
Libya. On the occasions when his son called home, Stevens said, he didn't share many details about his work other than
to say that "he was very optimistic about the results of the election and the new government." They last spoke by phone
in August and by e-mail days before his son's death.
Stevens, a registered Democrat, said he isn't politically active. He declined to say how he'll vote in the presidential
election.
He said his son, who was a career diplomat and had worked for Republican and Democratic presidents, hadn't expressed
concerns to him about security or support from the administration. "He felt very strongly about Secretary Clinton,"
Stevens said, referring to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. "He felt she was an extremely able person."
As for whether he had the tools and protection he needed for his job, Stevens said of his son: "We didn't get into that"
sort of discussion. "I never heard him say a critical word about the State Department or the administration, or any
administration for that matter. He came up through the foreign service, not politics."
Obama Call
Stevens said neither of the two presidential campaigns reached out to him, and that he is grateful for that. He said
Obama telephoned him after his son's death to express his regrets and talk about identifying the perpetrators who
should be brought to justice, and that the conversation was in the context of his presidential duties and not political.
While pollsindicate that voters say Obama would do a better job on foreign policy issues, Republicans see an
opportunity to cut into that advantage, pointing to surveys showing that voters have grown less satisfied since the Sept.
11 assault in Libya.
Stevens stopped short of directly criticizing either candidate.
"I'm not sure exactly what he's been saying and not saying, but our position is it would be a real shame if this were
politicized," Stevens said, referring to Romney. "Our concern now is memorializing Chris and remembering his
contribution to the country."
Campaign Shift
Romney's current foreign policy position marks a shift in tone from a campaign that has focused almost exclusively on
economic issues and jobs.
The Romney team is attempting to link two campaign messages by charging Obama with weakening American interests
abroad at the same time as he's failed to boost the economy back home.
Speaking to voters on Oct. 12 in Richmond, Virginia, Romney chastised Vice President Joe Biden for his defense of the
administration's actions in the Libya attack.

Subject: Video shows Libyans helping rescue US ambassador after attack (Reuters)
BENGHAZI (Reuters) - An amateur video appears to show Libyans trying to rescue U.S. ambassador
Christopher Stevens from a room filled with smoke at the U.S. mission where he was found unconscious after
last week's attack by a mob protesting against a film that denigrates the Prophet Mohammad.
The video,, which appeared on the interne and a copy of which was obtained by Reuters in Benghazi,
confirms reports that suggested the U.S. envoy died of asphyxiation after the building caught fire.
The footage also sheds new light on the circumstances of the ambassador's death, apparently showing for the
first time that some of the people who forced their way into the U.S. compound later tried to rescue Stevens
after they found him lying alone, with no security detail, in one of the rooms in the building.
The video shows a group of young men who had earlier stormed the compound telling other protesters by the
light of torches and mobile phones that they had found someone who appeared to be a foreigner lying on the
floor.
"There is someone inside He is a foreigner, he is a foreigner. Take him out," said one man, shouting for
help.
"Bring him out, man! Bring him out," another said.
"The man is alive. Bring him out, man. Bring him out," said a third.
"Alive, Alive! God is Greatest," the crowd cried. Someone called for a car.
"Make space, is there someone who is a medic around? Anyone who can get a car quickly?" another man can
be heard saying.
Stevens and three other embassy staff died when gunmen attacked the U.S. consulate and a safe house in the
eastern Libyan city on Tuesday night. The attackers were part of a crowd blaming America for a film they said
insulted the Prophet Mohammad.
Security personnel were separated from Stevens during the attack, U.S. officials said, in the chaos of smoke
and gunfire that ensued.
The identity and motive of the attackers remain unclear. Activists who took part in the protest said the
motive was rage at the video produced in California and which describes the Prophet as a homosexual and

Some Libyan officials blamed the attack on radical Islamist groups linked to al Qaeda, such as regional
affiliate Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, and Ansar al-Sharia. Both groups back the introduction of Islamic
Sharia law rather than democracy.
The footage shows Stevens lying on the floor in a smoke-filled room after protesters had stormed the
compound and set fire to its buildings.
Minutes later he was pulled out of the room through a window, and then placed on the courtyard's stone tile
floor. A young man is seen putting his hand on his neck to check if he was breathing.
A protester wearing a white T-shirt who had carried Stevens out of the room was hugged by a fellow
protestor in a traditional expression of gratitude.
Seconds after the protesters found Stevens was alive, a young man in the background can be heard shouting:
"Take him to my car, bring him to my car."
A doctor on duty in the emergency room at the Benghazi Medical Centre that night has said local civilians
brought in the ambassador at around 1 a.m. While the doctor performed CPR for 45 minutes, Stevens died of
asphyxiation due to smoke inhalation. His body was later returned to U.S. custody.

Subject: FVV: Benghazi update (1200 local)
Update from Rep. Stevens in Benghazi, based on largely on info from acting PM Ali Tarhouni and acting FM
Salah Bishari:
• TNC caretaker cabinet/members were up until 4am following events in Tripoli and discussing plans for
the coming days. Tarhouni said the TNC has been in constant communication with its people in Tripoli,
including both fighters and those entrusted with implementing the stabilization plans. Rebels in Tripoli,
in coordination with the TNC, have begun to set up checkpoints inside the city and guard public
buildings.
• TNC chairman Abd al Jalil and PM Jibril made statements to the media last night, urging people to
refrain from revenge attacks and destruction of public buildings.
• There has so far been "no bloodbath" or serious looting.
• The capture of Sail al-Islam al-Qadhafi and Mohamed al-Qadhafi is significant The TNC, including
Abd al-Jalil himself, intervened with rebels surrounding Mohamed's house to ensure that they did not
harm him. They understood that it would be harmful to the revolution and the TNC if he were
killed. These events were captured live by Al Jazeera in interviews with Mohamed. Both brothers are
in rebel custody (at this time, it is unclear to us exactly who is holding them, however).
• Per Tarhouni, the next steps are: 1) find Muammar Qadhafi; 2) issue a statement announcing the end of
the Qadhafi regime and the start of the interim period under the INC (TNC staff have begun drafting
this statement already); 3) insure the delivery of essential services and commodities (esp addressing the
acute shortages of fuel, children's milk, and medication for blood pressure and diabetes); and 4) move
the TNC to Tripoli.
• Regarding the move to Tripoli, Tarhouni said security arrangements would need to be made before they
could send the TNC.' leadership to the capital. We have heard from another contact that some TNC
members are already making plans to fly to Misurata and the Western Mountains, possibly as early as
today, and from there drive to Tripoli.
• Request for assistance: Tarhouni, who also holds US citizenship, said the items listed above (gas, diesel,
baby milk, and medicine) are urgently needed in Tripoli and recommended that the USG ship those
items directly to Zawiya's Port and publicize such assistance as soon as feasible (in coordination with
the INC). He said this would bring tlie US even more goodwill than it has already earned bore

Secretary Clinton's leadership on Libya
HRC has been a critical voice on Libya in administration deliberations, at NATO, and in contact group
meetings — as well as the public face of the U.S. effort in Libya. She was instrumental in securing the
authorization, building the coalition, and tightening the noose around Qadhafi and his regime.
February 25 — HRC announces the suspension of operations of the Libyan embassy in Washington.
February 26 — HRC directs efforts to evacuate all U.S. embassy personnel from Tripoli and orders the closing of
the embassy.
February 26 HRC made a series of calls to her counterparts to help secure passage of UNSC 1970, which
imposes sanctions on Gaddafi and his family and refers Qadhafi and his cronies to the ICC
February 28 — HRC travels to Geneva, Switzerland for consultations with European partners on Libya. She
gives a major address in which she says: "Colonel Qadhafi and those around him must be held accountable for
these acts, which violate international legal obligations and common decency. Through their actions, they have
lost the legitimacy to govern. And the people of Libya have made themselves clear: It is time for Qadhafi to go
— now, without further violence or delay." She also works to secure the suspension of Libya from membership
in the Human Rights Council.
Early March — HRC appoints Special Envoy Chris Stevens to be the U.S. representative to Benghazi
March 14 — HRC travels to Paris for the G8 foreign minister's meeting. She meets with TNC representative
Jibril and consults with her colleagues on further UN Security Council action. She notes that a no-fly zone will
not be adequate.
March 14-16 — HRC participates in a series of high-level video- and teleconferences
She is a leading voice for strong UNSC action and a NA TO civilian
protection mission.

March 17— HRC secures Russian abstention and Portuguese and African support for UNSC 1973, ensuring that
it passes. 1973 authorizes a no-fly zone over Libya and "all necessary measures" - code for military action - to
protect civilians against Gaddafts army.
March 24 — HRC engages with allies and secures the transition of command and control of the civilian
protection mission to NATO. She announces the transition in a statement.
March 18-30— HRC engages with UAE, Qatar, and Jordan to seek their participation in coalition
operations. Over the course of several days, all three devote aircraft to the mission.
March 19 — HRC travels to Paris to meet with European and Arab leaders to prepare for military action to
protect civilians. That night, the first U.S. air strikes halt the advance of Gaddafi's forces on Benghazi and
target Libya's air defenses.
March 29 — HRC travels to London for a conference on Libya, where she is a driving force behind the creation
of a Contact Group comprising 20-plus countries to coordinate efforts to protect civilians and plan for a post-
Qadhafi Libya. She is instrumental in setting up a rotating chair system to ensure regional buy-in.
April 14— HRC travels to Berlin for NATO meetings. She is the driving force behind NATO adopting a

Limited Security in Benghazi, Secrecy Over Safe House, Contributed to Tragedy
The U.S. Consulate in Benghazi under attack on Sept. 11. The deadly assault raised questions about security lapses and
misjudgments by U.S. officials.
The deadly assault on a U.S. diplomatic mission in Libya on Sept. 11 was preceded by a succession of security lapses and
misjudgments, compounded by fog-of-battle decisions, that raise questions about whether the scope of the tragedy
could have been contained.
U.S, officials issued alerts and ordered security precautions in neighboring Egypt ahead of protests and violence on Sept.
11, but largely overlooked the possibility of trouble at other diplomatic postings in the region.
The State Department chose to maintain only limited security in Benghazi, Libya, despite months of sporadic attacks
there on U.S. and other Western missions. And while the U.S. said it would ask Libya to boost security there, it did so just
once, for a one week period in June, according to Libyan officials.
The U.S. didn't seriously consider sending in the military during the attack. It summoned rapid-response teams of
Marines only after the U.S. ambassador was dead. State Department officials said they doubted the Pentagon could
have mobilized a rescue force quickly enough to make a difference during the fighting. The Pentagon waited for
guidance from State, which is responsible for diplomatic security, a senior military official said,

Adding a new dimension to the chain of events, the siege also engulfed what officials now describe as a secret safe
house used by American officials and security personnel involved in sensitive government programs after last year's
Libyan revolution.
Even when that building, also known as the "annex," came under attack, U.S. officials were reluctant to divulge its
existence, and the secrecy complicated the Libyan response and the eventual American evacuation, according to Libyan
security officials.
The Obama administration has defended levels of security in place. Though intelligence officials are investigating
indications al Qaeda's North African affiliate had connections with militants who mounted the attack, U.S. officials say
the evidence still indicates it was a spontaneous response to protests in Cairo against an anti-Islamic video. But a
detailed review based on interviews with more than a dozen U.S. and Libyan officials shows months of ominous signals
suggesting the need for better security, along with missed chances for delivering it.
President Barack Obama, in his re-election campaign, gets high marks from voters on national security, but has drawn
Republican criticism over his handling of the anti-American protests.
After a classified briefing to lawmakers by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Thursday, Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine)
called the security "woefully inadequate, given the security-threat environment." The State Department has convened
an Accountability Review Board to investigate the attack, something it is required to do after such an incident.
U.S. officials still are struggling to piece together details of the attack. For more than a week after U.S. Ambassador
Christopher Stevens was killed, the State Department couldn't say why he was in Benghazi. On Thursday, officials said
they believed he was there to attend the launch of a joint U.S.-Libyan cultural and educational program.
Mr. Stevens and Sean Smith, an information officer, were killed at the consulate, in the first wave of the attack. Former
Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods died later, at the sensitive safe house or annex a kilometer away. It remains
unclear to U.S. and Libyan officials whether the militants knew of that facility or just followed a U.S. convoy to it after
the consulate attack.
The apparent lapses extended to firefighting equipment. Rescue attempts at the main building were thwarted in part by
the absence of smoke-protection masks and fire extinguishers, said Libyan guards. Senior State Department officials said
these wouldn't have provided sufficient protection against the diesel-fueled inferno.
State Department officials said security for the consulate was frequently reviewed and was deemed sufficient to counter
what U.S. officials considered to be the most likely threat at the time: a limited hit-and-run attack with rocket-propelled
grenades or improvised explosive devices, or IEDs.
There was a string of attacks in Benghazi in the months before Sept. 11, including a June 6 IED explosion outside.the
consulate compound. "These types of incidents were the ones that were our principal concerns," a senior State
Department official said. Based on the outcome of the June 6 attack, in which a perimeter wall was damaged but no
Americans hurt, a second State Department official added: "Our security plan worked."
Current and former officials said the security choices in Benghazi reflected efforts by Mr. Stevens to maintain a low-
profile security posture and show faith in Libya's new leaders, despite questions about their ability to rein in heavily
armed bands of militants. Officials say Mr. Stevens personally advised against having Marines posted at the embassy in
Tripoli, apparently to avoid a militarized U.S. presence.
The security plan for the consulate also reflected confidence Mr. Stevens felt in a city where he worked for months with
rebels battling Moammar Gadhafi's rule. State Department officials said he didn't consult with Washington before
traveling to Benghazi, located in an area that has become notorious for its volatile mix of Islamist militancy and heavy
weaponry.

"This is what happens when you're relying on a government that's not in control of the whole country," said Randa
Fahmy Hudome, a former U.S. official. Benghazi "was awash with weapons in the hands of various brigades who were all
in combat with one another. It wasn't a secret."
A State Department official said Washington doesn't control the travels of ambassadors within countries where they are
posted. But some current and former U.S. officials say it was a mistake for the administration to put so much faith in the
Libyans to provide adequate security so soon after the revolution, and questioned why more robust contingency plans
weren't in place.
One senior State Department official described the Benghazi consulate as a "temporary office" that security officers
treated as a "subsidiary" of the embassy in Tripoli, where more strenuous procedures and precautions were in place. "So
Tripoli had the plan and the idea was that these people would just fall back on Tripoli, which they did in this situation, so
it worked," the official said.
Alarm bells about security in Benghazi started sounding this spring.
On April 10, someone threw an explosive device at a convoy carrying United Nations envoy Ian Martin. On May 22, a
rocket-propelled grenade hit offices of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
After the June 6 IED attack on the U.S. consulate, the U.S. asked Libya to step up security around American installations,
said a State Department spokesman. Libyan officials say the request was only for one week. A State Department official
said the temporary security buildup was needed to repair damage to the wall.
The Libyan who received the request said the added security was two extra cars of men plus some heavy machine guns.
After the repairs, Libyan security returned to normal levels: a four-man team of armed guards protecting the perimeter
and four unarmed Libyan guards inside to screen visitors.
Tensions remained high, however. On June 11, a rocket-propelled grenade hit a convoy in Benghazi carrying Britain's
ambassador to Libya, injuring two bodyguards. Britain closed its consulate in Benghazi.
The U.S. deemed the security level sufficient and decided to stay, "given the very important mission that we have in
eastern Libya to support U.S. national security interests," said a senior State Department official. He said "robust"
security improvements had been made to the compound since the Americans moved into it in May 2011, including
cement barriers and barbed wire.
As the attacks mounted in Benghazi, intelligence agencies warned of the growing security risks, but didn't have specific
intelligence about particular threats or planned attacks. On Aug. 27, the State Department issued a travel warning for
Libya, citing a threat of assassinations and car bombings in both Benghazi and Tripoli. The warning said the embassy's
ability to intervene was limited because armed groups behind the attacks were "neither sanctioned nor controlled by
the Libyan government."
In the days before Sept. 11, intelligence agencies issued their annual warning of heightened security risks around the
anniversary of the 2001 attacks. Many counterterrorism officials saw a lessened risk this year than last year, which was
the 10th anniversary and the first one after the killing of Osama bin Laden.
In Libya, embassy personnel conducted a security review right before the anniversary. It determined there was no
reason to think an attack was planned or the consulate in Benghazi was "insufficiently postured," said a senior
administration official.
Across the border in Egypt, red flags appeared on Sept. 8, after a radical Egyptian cleric aired on television portions of an
anti-Islam video believed made in the U.S. Officials at the U.S. embassy in Cairo that night sent the first of several
messages alerting Washington and other embassies in the region to the video and seeking guidance about responding
and the potential for a backlash.

The embassy in Cairo knew the film was beginning to get attention because it was monitoring social media, according to
State Department officials. "That was well ahead of any intelligence that they got from Washington," one official said.
On Monday, Sept. 10, intelligence agencies sent a warning directly to the U.S. embassy in Cairo saying the protests could
turn violent. Diplomatic security officers in Cairo sent most embassy personnel home.
Intelligence analysts at the time had no reason to believe the unrest would spill over to neighboring Libya or beyond,
officials said. State Department officials likewise found no reason to put other embassies in the region on heightened
alert and decided not to call in Marine teams to help in Cairo.
"We have to put this in context: We've had protest after protest in Cairo. We know where the military is. We know
where to find them when we need them," a senior State Department official said.
Ethan Chorin, an American development economist working with U.S. and Libyan officials on a hospital in Benghazi, said
he spoke by phone to Mr. Stevens about an hour before the assault, and the ambassador told him there was "no
indication of trouble" following the protests in Egypt. Mr. Chorin said a subsequent conversation he had with the
ambassador's security officer was cut short by what the officer said was a serious problem. Several minutes later, he
could, hear explosions from his hotel room across town as the assault began.
During a final call by Mr. Chorin to a security officer at the consulate, the attack began, and his call was cut off.
The attack on the consulate compound started shortly after 9:30 p.m. Benghazi time, which was 3:30 p.m. Eastern time,
according to Libyan security guards.
Besides the four armed Libyans outside, five armed State Department diplomatic security officers were at the consulate.
Diplomatic security agent David Ubben was inside the main building with Mr. Stevens and Mr. Smith, the information-
management officer, when the attack,ers set it on fire around 15 minutes after the shooting started.
The three took refuge in a safe room, but found themselves overcome by smoke and agreed they would make a break
for it through a window, according to a State Department official familiar with Mr. Ubben's role.
Mr. Ubben, a 30-year-old Iraq war veteran, managed to escape, but lost contact with Messrs. Stevens and Smith in the
dense smoke, the official said.
In Washington, officials said, National Security Adviser Tom Donilon informed Mr. Obama of the attack in progress
ahead of a 5 p.m. Eastern time Oval Office meeting with Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Gen. Martin Dempsey,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. By then, the main villa in the consulate compound was on fire.
There was no serious consideration at that hour of intervening with military force, officials said. Doing so without Libya's
permission could represent a violation of sovereignty and inflame the situation, they said. Instead, the State Department
reached out to the Libyan government to get reinforcements to the scene.
The Libyans sent about two dozen security men, according to members of the reinforcement team, who arrived at the
consulate 30 minutes after the fighting had started.
In addition to the shooting, thick black smoke and flames hindered a proper search inside the consulate, an effort
further hampered by the absence of fire extinguishers and masks.
Mr. Ubben and the other security agents made several trips into the building to try to find the diplomats but could
spend only brief periods inside, and suffered varying degrees of lung damage, said the official familiar with Mr. Ubben's
role.

On one trip in, they found Mr. Smith's body and pulled it out. There was no sign of the ambassador.
The American security personnel evacuated the consulate and made their way to the secret site called the annex.
A plane with an American security team from Tripoli arrived in Benghazi about 1:30 a.m., according to the Libyan
account. The team found its way to the annex using global positioning devices. Libyans who accompanied the Americans
to the scene weren't told of the annex's location because of its connection to sensitive programs, and the Americans
didn't give them the GPS coordinates or address. Libyans at an emergency operation center in Benghazi were also kept
in the dark to the exact location.
As the U.S. and Libyan reinforcement team arrived from the airport, fighting broke out at the annex.
That assault, using rocket-propelled grenades and mortars, was described in U.S. and Libyan accounts as more
sophisticated than the earlier attack on the consulate, and it appeared to involve militants with possible links to al
Qaecla.
The Libyans led a convoy of roughly 30 Americans from the safe house to the airport, where a plane had been waiting.
But they quickly realized the plane was too small to evacuate everyone at once.
"We were surprised at the numbers of Americans who were at the airport," said Libyan Deputy Prime Minister Mustafa
Abushagour. "We figured three or four people. No one told us the numbers ahead of time."
The deputy prime minister said that he learned about the extent of U.S. intelligence operations only after the incident.
We have no problem with intelligence sharing or gathering, but our sovereignty is also key," said Mr. Abushagour.
The first to be flown to Tripoli were American diplomats and civilians. The U.S. security team waited for a second flight.
During the wait, Libyan troops went, without any Americans, to the Benghazi Medical Center to retrieve the
ambassador's body. Around 8 a.m., according to Libyan officials, the security detail flew back to Tripoli, carrying the
body.
Some officials say the U.S. could have sent military forces to Benghazi from U.S. Naval Air Station Sigonella, which is
some 450 miles away in Sicily, or mobilized a Marine team in Rota, Spain. Some officials said the U.S. could also have
sent aircraft to the scene in a "show of force" to scare off the attackers.
State Department officials dismissed the suggestions as unrealistic. "They would not have gotten there in two hours,
four hours or six hours. They don't have troops sitting in a room next to an airplane with a pilot just sitting in the next
room drinking coffee," one senior State Department official said.
Some defense officials agreed with that assessment, given limited communications to Americans on the ground during
the assault. "It was the fog of war," one said.
At the annex, Mr. Ubben suffered head and leg injuries from a mortar explosion. He was released this week from
intensive care but remains at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, in Bethesda, Md., the State Department
official familiar with his role said.
Mr. Ubben, a Marylander, is married and has a stepdaughter and an infant son. He is conscious and able to
communicate, according to his father, Rex Ubben.
"He's in good spirits," the senior Mr. Ubben said. "They're pretty confident that he'll be able to walk again."

Libyans march against Islamist militias in Benghazi
By Peter Graff and Suleiman Al-Khalidi
BENGHAZI, Libya Fri Sep 21, 2012 2:23prn EDT
(Reuters) - Thousands of Libyans marched in Benghazi on Friday in support of democracy and against the
Islamist militias that Washington blames for an attack on the U.S. consulate last week that killed four
Americans including the ambassador.
The "Rescue Benghazi day" demonstration called for the government to disband armed groups that have refused
to give up their weapons since the NATO-backed revolution that toppled Muammar Gaddafi last year,
Marchers headed for a main square where a much smaller counter demonstration of hundreds of supporters of
hardline Islamist group Ansar al-Sharia were waiting.
"It's obvious that this protest is against the militias. All of them should join the army or security forces as
individuals, not as groups," medical student Ahmed Sanallah, 27, said. "Without that there will be no prosperity
and no success for the new Libya."
The late afternoon demonstration had a cheerful atmosphere as families marched with small children on their
shoulders.
Fighter jets and helicopters roared overhead in a show of official support for the demonstration, which has been
enthusiastically promoted by the city's authorities.
"Those military battalions that want to impose their ideology on the people of Libya will be confronted," Saleh
Gaouda, a member of new ruling national congress, said.
"This city wants to go back to stability and participate in building the state"
In a sign of the cheerful atmosphere, one ear had a giant cardboard model of Benghazi's landmark lighthouse
strapped to the roof As the sun set and the crowd began to disperse, someone shot fireworks into the air.

"DEFEND BENGHAZI"
Although the main demands of the marchers did not mention the attack on the U.S. consulate, it seems to have
provided a strong impetus for the authorities to rally support behind the country's weak government.
U.S. ambassador Christopher Stevens was well liked in Libya, and many people who were angered by an anti-
Islamic film made in the United States consider the attack on the embassy to have been excessive. Some
placards in English, intended for international news cameras, read: "We demand justice for Stevens" and "Libya
lost a friend".
"1 am out today to defend Benghazi. Killing the ambassador is a completely separate thing," 26-year-old Arnjad
Mohammed Hassan, a network engineer, said "I don't give a damn about the killing of the ambassador because
the Americans offended the Prophet. I am just here for Benghazi."
Benghazi, 1,000 km (600 miles) from Tripoli across largely empty desert, is controlled by various armed
groups, including some comprised of Islamists who openly proclaim their hostility to democratic government
and the West.
Some of these have been identified by local people as being among those who were at the consulate protest last
week. U.S. officials have described the violence as a "terrorist attack".
One group linked to the attack is Ansar al-Shatia, which has denied involvement in the violence.
Abu Al-Qaa, a demonstrator at the Ansar al-Sharia counter demonstration, said Stevens "was preparing for he
entry of American troops into Libya".
"The will of the Prophet was to expel infidels from Muslim lands so that Muslims prevail. Terrorizing your
enemy is one of Islam's tenets." ,
He said he had fought against American troops in Iraq where he was arrested and sent back to Gaddafi's Libya
and jailed for three years.
One banner at that demonstration read: "Day to rescue Benghazi or day to rescue America?"
In southern Libya, at least six people were killed and 12 injured in clashes between security forces and a local
group, a security official and a resident said on Friday.
Security forces were sent to the town of Brak, 700 km (400 miles) south of Tripoli, on Wednesday to stop a
group broadcasting songs about Craddafi on the radio, the official said The security forces, made up of former
rebel fighters, came under attack upon arrival.

Subject: UPDATE: Libyan Islamist says he was at U.S. consulate during attack (Reuters)
BENGHAZI (Reuters) - A Libyan militia commander who U.S officials say is under investigation in connection
with the attacks on the American consulate in Benghazi which led to the death of the ambassador said he was
present during the incident but was not one of the ringleaders.
Some American newspapers have quoted unnamed Libyan officials as pointing to Ahmed Abu Khattala as
the leader of the attacks on Sept, 11. The newspapers also reported that the officials said Abu Khattala's
whereabouts were unknown.
U.S. government sources told Reuters that Abu Khattala is being investigated as a suspect in the Benghazi
consulate attacks though U.S. investigators are not clear at this point if he played a role in leading or organising
the attacks.
In an interview, Abu Khattala told Reuters he had only heard he was a suspect through news media and was
surprised that officials had told journalists he was at large.
"These reports say that no one knows where I am and that I am hiding," he said. "But here I am in the open,
sitting in a hotel with you I'm even going to pick up my sister's kids from school soon."
Sitting with a friend in the restaurant of a Benghazi hotel, the 41-year-old, sporting a red felt hat and a full
salt-and-pepper beard, laughed gently.
"There were many people there from Ansar al-Shariah, from other brigades and from the general public," the
official, who refused to be named, said, referring to the hardline Islamist militia group which has been blamed
for the attack.
"Just because someone is there doesn't mean they were behind it."
Abu Khattala denied being a leader of Ansar al-Shariah, but said he was friendly with the group and knew its
membership well.
A U.S. official said there may be more than person taking a lead role in the group.
"Ansar al-Shariah is a factionalised militant group without one home address," the official told Reuters.
"There may be several military commanders playing a role in its activities."
Abu Khattala said that on the night of Sept 11, he received a phone call telling him that an attack on the U.S.

consulate was in progress and that he then went to the scene.
"I arrived at the street parallel to the consulate and waited for other brigade leaders to show me the way to
the buildings," he said. "I arrived at the scene just like the others did -- to see what was happening."
He said that after he arrived at the consulate, he began to help direct traffic with other militia leaders.
"People were crashing into each other because of the chaos and there was sporadic shooting," he said.
Abu Khattala said he called the commanders of Benghazi's security forces -- the February 17 brigade and the
Supreme Security Committee -- and told them to remove their cars and people from the consulate to avoid
clashes.
"Soon after I made my calls, one of the guards told me that four men were detained in a building inside the
compound who had been shooting at the demonstrators," he said.
"By the time I arrived at the building the men had already escaped. At that point I left the scene and didn't
return."
Little is known about Abu Khattala, who hails from Benghazi.
Abu Khattala, who is unmarried, said he went to public schools in Libya but did not attend university or
community college. He said he was imprisoned for a total of 10 years for "knowing suspected personalities". He
refused to elaborate.
"I've also never left the country," he said when asked if he received any education or training abroad.
Abu Khattala said he formed the Obeidah al-Jarrah brigade at the beginning of the armed revolt which
toppled Muammar Gaddafi last year.
The shadowy armed militia was blamed in the killing last July of military chief Abdelfattah Younes, a
former Gaddafi loyalist who had defected to the rebels.
Younes was involved in the 1969 coup that brought Gaddafi to power. He was interior minister before he
defected and took a senior position in the rebellion in February.
Some rebels, especially hard-line conservative Islamist fighters who were persecuted under Gaddafi, were
never happy to serve under a man who had been so close to Gaddafi.
Abu Khattala was questioned by Libyan authorities but released because no evidence directly linked him to
the killing. He said he later broke up his militia group.
"After the revolution Obeidah al-Jarrah was disbanded because we were a fighting group and the war was
over in Benghazi," he said.
But many members of Obeidah al-Jarrah are known to have joined other brigades, including Ansar al-
Shariah in Benghazi.

The Other Embassy Attack
Wall Street Journal Review & Outlook

Tehran tries to turn Yemen into another Lebanon.
Government emails from Libya released this week show Foggy Bottom's finest knew within hours that an Islamist terror
group was behind the September 11 attacks that killed four Americans. Maybe this truth drip will force President Obama
to explain why his Administration so strenuously downplayed a terrorist connection and insisted an anti-Islamic video
was to blame. But amid media and Congressional efforts to uncover the truth about Benghazi, it's worth paying
attention to another attack on a U.S. diplomatic mission last month.
On September 13, several hundred people, mostly young men, stormed the Embassy in Yemen's capital of Sanaa. The
American staff had been evacuated, but the compound was overrun. In the melee four Yemenis died. At the time the
event was lumped in with other anti-American protests in Tunisia, Pakistan and Egypt that week.
Yet it has since become clear that the Yemen assault was also well coordinated, likely by one or more militias. More
alarming is an Iranian connection that signals that Tehran is expanding its long and quiet war on America to a new front.
The U.S. isn't ruling out the possible complicity of a Yemeni army faction loyal to ousted President Ali Abdullah Saleh. He
stepped down from power in February as part of a U.S.-backed political transition. Since his departure, the military has
been divided amid jockeying for control in this tribal society. The Salehs deny the accusation.
During months of anti-government protests in 2011, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) also gained control of
territory in central Yemen. The group has several times tried to strike the U.S. mainland, and it may have been behind
the assassination this month of a Yemeni security officer employed at the U.S. Embassy.
However, the leading culprit is a Shiite rebel force backed by Tehran. Taking their name from a deceased commander,
the Houthi militia have since the mid-1990s fought against the Sunni-dominated government in Sanaa. According to
Western officials in Yemen, Iran has provided assistance for a Houthi resurgence in the past year Their fighters have
gone to Iran and Lebanon for training, and money and arms have flowed from both into Yemen, officials say. The
Houthis run a satellite TV channel, al-Maseera, from Beirut.
In July the Yemeni government said it had uncovered an Iranian spy ring in Sanaa. That got the attention of the Saudis,
who are anxious about Iranian efforts to stir up their co-religionist Shiites in Bahrain, Yemen and most of all in the
Kingdom itself.

Tehran's strategy in Yemen calls to mind Lebanon in the 1980s, when Iran built up Hezbollah into what has become the
leading political power in Lebanon. The Iran-backed terrorists burst onto the scene by bombing the U.S. embassy and
Marine barracks in Beirut. If the Houthis were in the lead last month, the command and control chain runs straight to
Tehran.
The interim Yemeni government is also grappling with a separatist armed uprising in the south. One of the leaders of the
fractured rebel force lives in Beirut and has tried to build a pro-Iran movement in the south, according to a Western
diplomat in Sanaa.
The Houthis and the southerners are separate groups with somewhat different agendas. But Iran may be facilitating a
partnership, as well as reaching out to al Qaeda. They have one goal in common: To bring down the pro-American
government in Sanaa. "Despite the fact that they're on opposite ends of the religious spectrum, al Qaeda and Iran will
cooperate," a Western diplomat says. "You see indications that Iran is helping al Qaeda by trying to forge relations
between AQAP, Houthis and southern rebels."
The U.S. supports a "national dialogue" to stabilize Yemen, while waging a drone campaign against the AQAP. Both are
commendable goals. Yet Tehran has emerged as a new threat to Yemen's future and is fighting the U.S. through terror
proxies. Congress can seek more clarity about Iran's designs with an inquiry into the Sanaa attacks.

Diplomats still in Benghazi say they had long questioned U.S.
reliance on local militia
By Nancy A. Youssef

On the day of the attack, U.S. officials had spotted a police officer taking photos of the compound from a villa
under construction across the streets. This was the view the officer would have had of the compound.

Even before the deadly Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. consulate that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and
three other Americans, diplomats from other nations and Libyan security officials had questioned the wisdom of
a U.S. decision to rely primarily on members of a local militia to protect its compound here.
Diplomats here told McClatchy that while it's customary to depend on local forces to protect diplomatic
missions, only the United States of the 10 or so foreign missions here allowed the local militia to be the first line
of defense. The others said they instead depended on military forces from their own country to provide security.
"A few months ago, there was a small attack here and the Libyans fled," said a diplomat from a European
nation who asked that he not be further identified so that he could speak candidly about his assessment of
security here. "After that, I decided to only use special forces" from his own country.
"We never considered using the brigades," he said, referring to the 17th of February Brigade, the local militia
that was considered the primary security force for the U.S. mission. "We assumed the United States had a
special relationship with the brigades."
Said another diplomat who requested anonymity for the same reasons: "I would never depend on the brigades."
The diplomat said he believed U.S. officials were unaware of the extremist links of those who were guarding
them. "The mistake of the Americans was not following the trail of Islamic radicals,' he said.
For some, the cost of supplying security made operating in Benghazi prohibitive. The British, for example,
brought in their own troops and also hired Libyans to provide security, according to Khalid al Hadar, who owns
the compound that the British used as their offices here. But after a June attack on the British ambassador's
convoy, the British withdrew from Benghazi. A British official told McClatchy that the realization that security
would require a larger — and more expensive — British force in Benghazi helped fuel that decision.
Hadar said the British still check in periodically on their compound, where a shot-up bulletproof windshield
from the June ambush still sits in what was the consulate's carport.
Who was responsible for determining how the United States protected its consulate here remains unclear two
months after Stevens' death. According to the State Department, the ambassador, in consultation with deputies

and security advisers, makes all security decisions, though they can be overruled from Washington. At a hearing
of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee last month, Eric Allan Nordstrom, who served as
the chief security officer at the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli from September 2011 until July, testified that he had
requested additional security.
Charlene Lamb, the deputy assistant secretary for diplomatic security, defended the security procedures that had
been taken in Benghazi, telling the hearing that there were five American security guards — the number
recommended by Nordstrom — along with Libyans in Benghazi when the attack took place.
"We had the correct number of assets in Benghazi at the time of 9/11 ," she said.
It is unknown what Stevens' own position on security in Benghazi was. A Western diplomat here said the trip
was Stevens' first extensive visit to Benghazi since he'd assumed the ambassador's post in May. The diplomat
said that when he heard the attack begin about 9:30 p.m., he assumed "that Chris was long gone."
The diplomat expressed surprise that Stevens hadn't been evacuated at the first sign of trouble. "We used to
take training from the Americans" on diplomatic security, he said.
How the U.S. vetted its local security force in Benghazi may be among the questions to come up Thursday
when the Senate Intelligence Committee holds a closed hearing on the attack. Witnesses expected to appear
include Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Matt Olsen, director of the National
Counterterrorism Center. David Petraeus, who resigned Friday as director of the CIA after acknowledging an
extramarital affair, had been scheduled to appear but will be replaced by Acting CIA Director Michael Morrell,
according to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the committee's chairwoman.
On Wednesday, during a ceremony honoring Stevens, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that the
administration has, in the wake of the 9/11 attack, dispatched a joint State and Defense Department task force
"to review high-threat posts to determine whether there are other improvements we need in light of the evolving
security challenges we now face."
Diplomats here, however, say they believe one such improvement had become obvious in the months after a
NATO air campaign helped topple the government of longtime Libyan leader Moanunar Gadhafi: Don't expect
local forces to protect you when they can't even protect themselves against local extremists and terrorists
groups in a city now defined by reprisal attacks. In the past week alone, two police stations here were bombed
and a police colonel's patrol car was destroyed in front of his house; extremist groups seeking to wrest control
of the city are the suspected culprits.
According to two guards who were at the compound that night, a four-member team from the 17th of February
Brigade's VIP protection unit was assigned to provide security inside the compound and serve as a quick-
reaction force. The 17th of February guards lived in a house closest to the front gate. According to the guards,
they tried to fend off the attack of as many 100 men that night, shooting repeatedly at them.
But 17th of February brigade leaders say they never considered themselves responsible for consulate security,
and Najib Muftah, 25, a co-founder of the brigade's VIP unit, denied that his group was in charge. "How could
four people secure a consulate?" he said.
Consulate security that night was a hodge-podge of local groups, in addition to a handful of Americans,
including Stevens' bodyguard. Outside, members of Libya's newly formed police force stood guard, sitting in
their parked vehicles. In addition, as many as five unarmed Libyans who worked for the Blue Mountain Group,
a Wales-based contractor, were stationed around the perimeter to watch for suspicious activity and search
visitors to the compound.
But as a rowdy caravan of attackers came barreling down the road leading to the consulate, the police officers
parked on the other side of the street from the consulate fled, according to a 31-year-old private security guard
who was there that night. The security guard asked not to be named for fearing he would be targeted for
working with Americans.

Earlier in the day, somewhere between 4 a.m. and 6 a.m., a member of the Blue Mountain Group reported that
he had seen one of the police officers photographing the inside of the compound from the upper floor of a villa
under construction across the street, according to the security guard, whose story confirms previous accounts.
But while reporters going through the consulate location in recent days discovered memos that suggested the
consulate had complained to Libyan authorities about the incident, Interior Ministry officials in Benghazi said
they were never contacted by U.S. officials.
Salah Daghman, the newly named deputy minister of interior for Benghazi, said that in any case it would be
unlikely that members of his police force would have challenged the Islamist group suspected of leading the
Sept. 11 attack. He described his men as "afraid of Ansar al Shariah."
"Everyone has a gun, he said. "Benghazi is not secure."
Members of the 17th of February Brigade first formed a "VIP protection" unit shortly after the anti-Gadhafi
uprising began in Febraury 2011. A group of about 50, they were trained by Qataris to protect the cavalcade of
politicians and diplomats who came to Benghazi, which was then the capital of rebel-controlled eastern Libya.
"If anything happened to the envoys that came to support the Libyan people, people would have believed
Gadhafi claims that we are all al Qaida," Muftah said. Among the foreign visitors the brigade's VIP unit
protected was French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who made a stunning visit here after Gadhafi's government
collapsed.
Stevens, who had been a special representative to the rebel government during the civil war, used the protection
unit as well, but not so much for security but as guides in the city, Muftah said. After the war, the brigade
continued to provide escorts as the U.S. formalized its presence here; most likely, Muftah said, because it was
the strongest force in Benghazi.
In addition, the brigade had a base less than a mile from the consulate that could provide additional forces if
needed, as it did Sept. 11. "And we had good relations with the United States," Muftah said.
Once the rebel government moved to Tripoli and nations began to reopen embassies there, the United States
kept working with the brigade, as many of its troops were incorporated into the newly formed Libyan army.
Once Benghazi had a trained and running police force, the Americans asked for police forces to be stationed
outside the consulate, said Fawzi Waniss, the head of the Benghazi Supreme Security Committee, the group
with responsibility for melding Libya's many armed organizations into a unified force.
As the security situation deteriorated, several Libyan officials and the Blue Mountain guards said they urged the
United States to buttress security at the consulate, even as Stevens was wildly popular among residents here.
The Libyans, they said, could not secure themselves from a mounting extremist threat.
"I told them, you should have your own security," Waniss said. "Don't depend on the Libyans."
But others have suggested that the U.S. officials may have felt such a step was unnecessary because the CIA
had established offices about a mile away and had promised to send security officers to the consulate, if needed.
All of the diplomats interviewed for this story said they were unaware of the CIA station's existence.
That in fact happened on the night of Sept. 11, according to a CIA timeline, which said security officers from
the CIA station, which U.S. officials refer to as an annex, were dispatched 25 minutes after the first reports of
trouble. It took another 25 minutes for the force to reach the consulate, however, because of resistance from
militants.
One diplomat here said that while he appreciated the effort of the CIA guards to render assistance, 25 minutes in
such a situation "is too late."

We, the undersigned, are deeply troubled by reports that you may be considering Ambassador Susan
Rice to succeed Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State. Though Ambassador Rice has been our Representative to
the U.N., we believe her misleading statements over the days and weeks following the attack on our embassy in
Libya that led to the deaths of Ambassador Stevens and three other Americans caused irreparable damage to her
credibility both at home and around the world.
In her interviews over that time, Ambassador Rice propagated a falsehood that the attacks were
"spontaneous," the outcome of a protest "spun out of control," and the result of a YouTube video. Only on
September 19— eight days after the attack — did the American people learn from National Counterterrorism
Director Matthew Olsen that the intelligence services considered the attack an act of terrorism and that al Qaeda
may have played a role.
Ambassador Rice is widely viewed as having either willfully or incompetently misled the American
public in the Benghazi matter. Her actions plausibly give U.S. allies (and rivals) abroad reason to question U.S.
commitment and credibility when needed. Thus, we believe that making her the face of U.S. foreign policy in
your second term would greatly undermine your desire to improve U.S. relations with the world and continue
your trust with the American people.
As you know, there have been repeated Congressional requests for information on the events of
September 11, 2012. Over the past month, our Senate colleagues have sent 13 separate letters to senior
Administration officials, including to you. Many Members of the House of Representatives have also sent
letters requesting answers. Our questions remain unanswered, and your Administration continues to deny
Congress access to critical information necessary for effective oversight.
Recent reports of discrepancies between the Department of Defense and the Central Intelligence
Agency's public timelines of the events on September 11 only exacerbate the problem, and we believe these
inconsistencies deserve closer examination.
In light of this troubling situation and the continued unanswered questions, we strongly oppose any
efforts to nominate Ambassador Susan Rice for the position of Secretary of State.
Sincerely,
Members of Congress

David Petraeus told Congress Friday in closed hearings that the CIA believed from the start that the September
11 attacks on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi were by terrorists. That leaves one VIP who's still missing from
Congressional scrutiny: Hillary Clinton.
GOP Congressman Peter King said Mr. Petraeus's testimony differed from what the former CIA director told
Congress immediately after the attacks., Mr. King also said Mr. Petraeus said that the CIA's original talking
points on the attacks were edited. The altered version became the basis for U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice's
misleading and now infamous comments blaming the attacks on a YouTube video, Both that discrepancy and
the issue of the altered talking points need further digging, especially if Ms. Rice is nominated to be the next
Secretary of State.
But Mr. Petraeus wasn't responsible for lax consulate security or the U.S. policy that led to the Libya debacle.
That's Mrs. Clinton's bailiwick. Last month in interviews from deepest Peru, the Secretary of State said "I take
responsibility" for Benghazi.
Except she hasn't. She was conveniently out of the country for this week's House Foreign Affairs hearing, and
Senate Foreign Relations Chairman John Kerry refuses to hold any hearings on Benghazi. His loyalty may get
him a cabinet job, while Carl Levin's Armed Services Committee also pretends nothing much happened in
Libya.

The targets of the attacks and its first victims were diplomats. Chris Stevens died of smoke inhalation in the
blaze, becoming the first American ambassador killed in the line of duty in over 30 years. A junior colleague
also died. These men were Mrs. Clinton's "responsibility." Several hours after the assault on the consulate,
members of the jihaclist militia Ansar al-Shariah turned on the CIA compound about a mile away, killing two of
Mr. Petraeus's men.
In Congressional hearings last month, career State officials admitted that threat warnings from Benghazi were
overlooked and requests for better security turned down. They said Foggy Bottom misjudged the ability of a
weak Libyan state to protect them. Ifs not clear how high up the chain these concerns went, but over to you,
Mrs. Clinton.
For over a week after the attacks, the Administration blamed the YouTube video. Mrs. Clinton didn't push this
misleading narrative in public as enthusiastically as Ms. Rice. Still, she bought into it. The father of Tyrone
Woods, a CIA contractor who was killed in Benghazi, told media outlets last month that Mrs. Clinton tried to
comfort him by promising that the U.S.-based maker of the video would be "prosecuted and arrested"—though
terrorists killed his son.
Beyond the Benghazi attacks is the larger issue of the Administration's Libya policy, a failure that Mrs. Clinton
should also answer for. At the start of the Libya uprising, Washington hid behind the U.N. Security Council to
resist calls for intervention. Mrs. Clinton's department then made the mistake of agreeing to a U.N. arms
embargo on both the Gadhafi regime and the rebels. This blunder forced the rebels to look elsewhere for
weapons and cash, particularly Golf states like Qatar that favored Islamist militias.
As Gadhaffs forces were about to overrun Benghazi in March, the Arab League, Britain and France called for
military intervention. Only after the Security Council gave the green light—when Russia abstained—did NATO
launch air strikes. American cruise missiles and *bombers led the way, but on April 7 President °barna pulled
the U.S. out of a leadership combat role.
The U.S. also waited until July to recognize the Benghazi rebel opposition as "the legitimate governing
authority," after Luxembourg and 25 other countries had already done so. The war lasted until October, much
longer than necessary.
American disengagement continued after Gadhafi fell. Though rich in oil, Libya's well-intentioned new leaders
needed advice and encouragement to build a functioning state. The most pressing need was to rein in the anti-
Gadhafi militias and stand up a national army. But the U.S. was reluctant to follow up with aid or know-how.
(See our December 24, 2011 editorial, "MIA on the Shores of Tripoli.") Qatar and the United Arab Emirates
stepped in with money and weapons, again favoring Islamist groups.

The Libyan people nonetheless voted in elections this summer for secular, pro-Western leaders. Yet the
government has limited powers and lacks a proper army. The militias have stepped into the vacuum, while al
Qaeda-style training camps proliferate in the hills around Benghazi.
***
This abdication is the backdrop to what happened on September 11. The large CIA outpost in Benghazi was
supposed to monitor jihadists and work with State to round up thousands of mobile surface-to-air missiles in
Libya. Yet it turns out that it's hard to fight terrorists on the ground with drones from remote bases. Without a
functioning government or broader U.S. aid, a small Islamist militia was able to target foreign diplomats and
eventually lay siege to the U.S. compound. The CIA closed its entire Benghazi shop that very morning—an
abject retreat.
For weeks, the Administration has tried to shift blame for Benghazi to the "intelligence community." Mr.
Petraeus's fall makes him an easy scapegoat, even as Mrs. Clinton takes a valedictory lap at State and sets her
sights on a 2016 Presidential run.
But U.S. Libya policy has been her handiwork, and with the exception of the fall of Gadhafi it is a notable
failure. Mrs. Clinton is also a main architect of U.S. policy in Syria, which continues to descend into disorder
that may engulf the region. She shouldn't get a free pass from Congress.

AP - Rice defends Benghazi remarks
By: Associated Press
November 21, 2012 07:03 PM EST
U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice said Wednesday her early account of the attack that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and
three other Americans in Benghazi was based on the initial intelligence community assessments and was always subject
to review and updates.
She said she respected Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who has been critical of her, but said "some of the statements he's
made about me have been unfounded, but I look forward to having the opportunity at the appropriate time to discuss
all of this with him."
Her comments attributed the attacks to a mob enraged over an anti-Muslim video posted on YouTube were widely
denounced by Republicans during the U.S. presidential campaign. The attack came an the 11th anniversary of the Sept.
11, 2001, terror attacks on the United States, and her critics said it was clearly a terrorist attack timed to take place on
the anniversary.
The focus has fallen on her because she is a longtime White House insider and is believed to be President Barack
Obama's first choice to replace Secrretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is not expected to stay on during his second term.
Rice told reporters outside the U.N. Security Council: "As a senior U.S. diplomat, I agreed to a White House request to
appear on the Sunday shows to talk about the full range of national security issues of the day, which at that time were
primarily and particularly the protests that were enveloping and threatening many diplomatic facilities, American
diplomatic facilities around the world, and Iran's nuclear program."
Hours before the Benghazi violence, a mob in Cairo attacked the U.S. Embassy there to denounce the videos as anti-
Islamic blasphemy. Killed in the Benghazi violence were Ambassador Chris Stevens, foreign service officer Sean Smith
and two former Navy SEALs, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods.
Rice said, "The attack on our facilities in Benghazi was obviously a significant piece of this" pattern.
"When discussing he attack against our facilities in Benghazi, I relied solely and squarely on the information provided to
me by the intelligence community," she said.
"I made clear that the information was preliminary, and that our investigations would give us the definitive answers,"
she added.

Hi Philippe:
Thanks very much for the note. I appreciate it.
I have deep sympathy for what your team and the families of the victims are going through. In Baghdad years
ago, someone I cared for very deeply lost her life with three others in the service of promoting our values
overseas. This experience probably added to the intensity behind my questions and responses as well.
In the interest of diplomacy and extending an olive branch: we should get a drink sometime, off the record.
Best,

As you can imagine this has been an intense time for everyone at the State Department, including me.
While I stand by the fundamental principles at issue here, that does not justify my unprofessional response to

GOP Lawmakers Demand Details Of Deadly Attack On U.S. Consulate In Libya By Ernesto LondoPlo The Washington Post
Thursday, September 27, 2012
Republican lawmakers demanded Wednesday that the Obama administration disclose details about the Sept. 11 attack
on U.S. compounds in eastern Libya that killed an ambassador and three other government employees.

The requests for information about the assault, including any cables about security written by slain Ambassador J.
Christopher Stevens, underscored the extent to which the incident has become a political liability for the White House
during the final stretch of President Obama's reelection campaign.
Lawmakers are asking whether the administration overlooked warning signs about the threat level in Libya, and some
have suggested the security at the U.S. installations in Benghazi was inadequate.
Senior administration officials, including Secretary of State Hillary Rodharn Clinton and Director of National Intelligence
James Clapper, have briefed Congress. But details on the events in Benghazi are still being assembled.
After initially describing the attack as a spontaneous act of mob violence in response to a video that disparaged Islam,
administration officials in recent days have begun to suggest it was a welt planned terrorist attack.
Clinton mentioned the Benghazi assault Wednesday during a speech at the U.N. General Assembly about the rise of
extremist militants in North Africa. Clinton did not specifically ascribe the attack to al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the
African offshoot of the terrorist organization, but she said the violent deaths of American officials underscored the
importance of defeating the group.
"With a larger safe haven and increased freedom to maneuver, terrorists are seeking to extend their reach and their
networks in multiple directions," Clinton said, according to an official transcript of her remarks. "And they are now
working with other violent extremists to undermine the democratic transitions underway in North Africa, as we
tragically saw in Benghazi."
U.S, counterterrorism chief Matthew Olsen told the the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee
last week that analysts are exploring whether al-Ofeeda's African branch played a role in the attack. Investigators are also
looking for evidence linking the assault to leaders of Ansar al-Sharia, a loose coalition of hard-line militants with a strong
presence in Libya.
Republican congressmen took the administration to task for what they called contradictory statements about the
Benghazi raid and initial information portraying it as a protest that turned violent.
"This seems like a pre-9/11 mindset — treating an act of war solely as a criminal matter," a group of 10 congressmen
wrote Wednesday in a letter to the president, referring to the 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States.
Sens. Johnny Isakson (Ga.) and Bob Corker (Tenn.), GOP members of the Foreign Relations Committee, sent a letter
Tuesday to Clinton expressing concern about the 'lack of security preparations made despite a demonstrable increase in
risks to US. officials and facilities in Benghazi.' The senators asked to see any relevant cables that Stevens wrote in the
days before he was killed.
The State Department has launched a type of probe called an accountability panel. The FBI is conducting a separate
criminal investigation into the incident. Citing the inquiries, administration officials have provided few new details about
the Benghazi raid in recent days. US. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice made the most extensive remarks
about the attack four days after the deaths. Her early accounts have come under scrutiny because they suggested that
U.S. government officials did not believe the assault had been well planned or coordinated.
"We look forward to a timely response that explains how the US. ambassador to the United Nations could characterize
an attack on a U.S. consulate so inaccurately," Sen. John McCain (Ariz.) and three fellow Republican senators wrote
Wednesday in a letter to Rice.

Septembe 25, 2012
The President
The White House
Washington, D.C. 20500
Dear Mr. President:
We are writing to express grave concern about the events surrounding the terrorist attack
in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012, that led to the murder of the United States
Ambassador to Libya, Christopher Stevens, and three other I_J,S. Government personnel. We
profoundly regret the loss of lives and seek to ensure all necessary steps are being taken to bring
the perpetrators to justice and prevent similar future attacks, While we appreciate your
willingness to provide the House of Representatives with an interagency briefing last week,
many of the members questions were left 'unanswered. To that end, we are seeking additional
information regarding the intelligence leading up to the attack, the security posture of our
embassy, the role former Guantanamo Bay detainees may have played, as well as the way
forward in Libya and, indeed, the region.
We are also disturbed by the public statements made by members of the Administration
that would lead the American public to believe this attack was a protest gone wrong, rather than
what it truly was — a terrorist attack on the United States on the anniversary of 9/11. Decades
after al Qaeda attacked our embassies in East Africa, which catalyzed a series of events that led
to the attacks on 9/11, it appears they executed a highly coordinated and well-planned attacked
against us again. Clearly, the threat from al Qaeda and affiliated groups has metastasized; yet we
do not appear to be learning from the past. For example, although brave Americans were once
more murdered by terrorists, it seems our response is to rely on a late-to-the-scene FBI
investigation. Media reports indicate investigators were prevented from arriving in Libya until
more than a week after the attack, but it is not clear that they have gone to Benghazi and have
therefore, been unable to secure valuable information, such as the Ambassador's journal. The
FBI has expertise in these situations, and they have a role to play However, this seems like a
pre 9/11 mindset - treating an act of war solely as a criminal matter, rather than also prioritizing
the gathering of intelligence to prevent future attacks. Moreover, given that violence in the
region continues unabated, what actions are we undertaking to deter terrorists fronl capitalizing

September 28, 2012
Statement by the Director of Public Affairs for National Intelligence Shawn Turner on the intelligence
related to the terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya
In the aftermath of the terrorist attack on U.S. personnel and facilities in Benghazi, Libya, the Intelligence
Community launched a comprehensive effort to determine the circumstances surrounding the assault and to
identity the mpetrators. We also reviewed all available intelligence to determine if there might be follow-on
attacks against our people or facilities in Libya or elsewhere in the world.
As the Intelligence Community collects and analyzes more information related to the attack, our understanding
of the event continues to evolve. In the immediate aftermath. there was information that led us to assess that the
attack began spontaneously following protests earlier that day at our embassy in Cairo. We provided that initial
assessment to Executive Branch officials and members of Congress, who used that information to discuss the
attack publicly and provide updates as they became available. Throughout our investigation we continued to
emphasize that information gathered was preliminary and evolving.
As we learned more about the attack, we revised our initial assessment to reflect new information indicating that
it was a deliberate and organized terrorist attack carried out by extremists. It remains unclear if any group or
person exercised overall command and control of the attack, and if extremist group leaders directed their
members to participate. However, we do assess that some of those involved were linked to gmups affiliated
with or sympathetic to al-Qa`ida. We continue to make progress, but there remain many unanswered questions.
As more information becomes available our analysis will continue to evolve and we will obtain a more
complete understanding of the circumstances surrounding the terrorist attack.
We continue to support the ongoing FBI investigation and the State Department review of the Benghazi terrorist
attack, pmviding the full capabilities and resources of the Intelligence Community to those efforts. We also will
continue to meet our responsibility to keep Congress fully and currently informed. For its part, the Intelligence
Community will continue to follow the information about the tragic events in Benghazi wherever it leads. The
President demands and expects that we will do this, as do Congress and the American people. As an Intelligence
Community, we owe nothing less than our best efforts in this regard, especially to the families of the four
courageous Americans who lost their lives at Benghazi in service of their country

This is a quick note to say that the hearings on Benghazi are going fine, from my perspective. Pat Kennedy has been
terrific substantive, precise, and firm in the face of some outlandish behavior. We continue to fend off questions

Sen. John McCain renewed his attacks on U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice on Tuesday, but he's gone soft on
Hillary.
As she wraps up her tenure at Foggy Bottom and mulls over a possible 2016 White House bid, Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton's decade-old bipartisan friendship with McCain appears to have helped shield her from
GOP fire — even as her agency finds itself in the thick of a partisan battle over Benghazi.
But McCain and Clinton also are battle-tested veterans of Washington who have seen their families become
targets of nasty political attacks — and who have often turned to laughter to get through it all. For Clinton, it
was Monica Ii ewinsky; for McCain it was the smear campaign during the 2000 GOP primary aimed at his
Bangladesh-born adopted daughter.
"I think it was the best version of strange bedfellows and at the same time a perfect match," Tmnera Luzzatto,
Clinton's Senate chief of staff from 2001 to 2009, said of her former boss's relationship with McCain. "They
share a sense of public service but also a sense of humor."
McCain, a leading voice on defense and foreign policy matters, has spent weeks belittling Rice as "not very
bright," incompetent and not qualified" to succeed Clinton as secretary of state. Rice s offense: incorrectly
characterizing the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya as sparked by spontaneous protests rather than as a
deliberate act of terrorism --- a lapse she has blamed on administration talking points that were approved by
intelligence officials.
But the Arizona Republican has largely spared Clinton from any criticism over the Sept. 11 Benghazi assault
that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. When Clinton tried to fall on her sword,
saying she alone was responsible for diplomatic security, McCain wouldn't have it He called Clinton's act
"laudable" but was adamant that the buck stops with President Barack Obama and that he would try to block
Rice's possible nomination as the nation's top diplomat.
While McCain seemed to dial back his attacks on Rice over the weekend, the senator was at it again Tuesday
after he and fellow GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire sat
down with Rice at the Capitol to quiz her about why the Obarna administration mischaracterized the attack as
other than terrorism.
"We are significantly troubled by many of the answers that we got and some that we didn't get," McCain told
reporters after the meeting. "It is clear the information that she gave the American people was incorrect."

Asked pointedly why he hasn't been as critical of Clinton, McCain did not directly mention the secretary, who
has decided against staying on for a second term.
"I've said it continuously that the State Department has responsibility," McCain told POLITICO. "I have been
very critical of the State Department and their actions. I've been critical of everybody's actions."
It wasn't the first time this year that McCain came to the former New York senator's defense. In July, McCain
took to the Senate floor and denounced Rep. Michele Bachmann and four other House Republicans for alleging
that longtime Clinton aide Hurna Abedin was working with the Muslim Brotherhood to infiltrate the top rungs
of the U.S. government.
The allegations, McCain said in his speech, amount to an "unwarranted and unfounded attack on an honorable
woman, a dedicated American and a loyal public servant?'
The gratitude from the Clinton camp that day was palpable,
"We were all so very moved when Sen. McCain took to the Senate floor that day. It was nothing short of
remarkable," said Clinton's longtime spokesman, Philippe Reines. But after being around him all those years
in the Senate and since, and seeing firsthand his fondness and respect for Huma, it was not surprising at all
"And when someone of Sen. McCain's stature stood up for her," he said, really gives people pause before
trafficking in vicious and disgusting lies."
McCain first met Clinton when she was first lady and got to know her better as he worked with her husband in
the mid-1990s on normalizing diplomatic relations with Vietnam, where the former Navy pilot endured 5V2
years as a prison of war after his plane was shot down. The daughter of a World War II Navy officer herself,
Clinton admired McCain's military service, and the two spent countless hours together at markups and hearings
of the Senate Armed Services Committee after the Sept. Ii, 2001, attacks.
"Like her husband, she really studies the issues, she is a policy wonk, and I mean that in a complimentary
fashion," McCain told POLITICO on Tuesday. "She puts people at ease, she is a role model to a lot of young
women in America -- my daughter [Meghan] admires her a great deal.

"Some people you hit it off with, some people not so much. She and I seemed to hit it off with each other and
enjoy each other's company."
Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) has traveled extensively with
McCain and Clinton and watched their relationship grow.
"To put it mildly, they don't always agree. John and I have been pestering and pressuring the administration,
including the secretary, on current matters like Syria, that we're not doing enough in Syria," Lieberman told
POLITICO. "But there is a strong, mutually respectful, personal relationship, and it's quite cordial.
"When we're all together, we not only talk seriously — we laugh a lot."
In 2008, McCain and Clinton were almost presidential rivals — if not for a young, charismatic upstart named
Barack Obama. Four years earlier, the two senators found themselves side by side on a small cruise ship in the
Arctic Circle, bundled up in jackets and ball caps and gazing at the "midnight sun" in Svalbard.
Invited by the Norwegian government, Clinton and McCain flew to the remote archipelago — famous for its 24
hours of continuous sunlight — to see firsthand the effects of climate change on the melting ice cap.
It was "a shared experience being in a place where we sat outside and watched the sun go down and just touch
the horizon and then go back up," McCain recalled.
Svalbard would be the first of many trips abroad together for the future secretary of state and 2008 GOP
standard-bearer: During a 2006 visit to Estonia, Clinton reportedly challenged McCain to a vodka-drinking
contest, the two have frequently met up at the annual Munich Security Conference, and they've dropped into
military hot spots like Iraq.
"They are two people I would invite to a party," said Graham, another frequent traveling companion.
But as Clinton exits the world stage — albeit perhaps temporarily — Graham and other Republicans are
signaling she may not escape the Benghazi debacle entirely unscathed.

House again."

Make Up Turned Break Up
By MAUREEN DOWD
WASHINGTON
Are the Republican senators unreasonable? Or is the secretary of state-manqué undiplomatic? Did the senators
sandbag Susan Rice? Or did Rice further inflame a tense situation? Is it a case of shooting the messenger and
playing politics? Or is national security dangerously infected with politics?
It seems as if it would have been simple enough for Rice to quickly admit that the administration talking points
she used on the Sept. 16 Sunday shows about the slaughter in Benghazi were misleading. But she went silent.
She has no wartime consigliere and, aside from the president's angry postelection defense of Rice, the White
House — perhaps relieved that she -14,as taking the heat rather than the president — wasn't running a strong
damage control operation that clarified matters.
Still, on last Sunday's talk shows, John McCain and Lindsey Graham softened their tone a bit. "She's not the
problem," McCain said The problem is the president of the United States," for failing to swiftly tell
Americans what his intelligence agencies had confirmed: that Benghazi was a terrorist attack involving Al
Qa.eda. affiliates.
When Rice asked to come to the Hill to meet with some of her Republican critics, it seemed détente was nigh.
But somehow the hour-and-a-half powwow caused an escalation, with McCain, Graham and Senator Kelly
Ayotte of New Hampshire emerging to say they had more reservations than before. Senator Bob Corker of
Tennessee, who's scheduled to meet with Rice on Wednesday, suggested that she would be better suited to run
the Democratic National Committee than State. If Rice can't soothe the egos of some cranky G.O.P. pots, how
would she negotiate with China?

Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the soft-spoken ranking member on the homeland security committee, hasn't
been part of this shrill debate. Though they had met only once or twice, Collins agreed to introduce Rice to the
Foreign Relations Committee in 2009 when Rice was nominated as the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Rice's
grandparents immigrated from Jamaica to Portland, Maine.
"I don't bear any animus to her at all," the senator said. "In fact, to the contrary."
But she said she is "troubled" by Rice's role. "If I wanted to be secretary of state," Collins observed, "I would
not go on television and perform what was essentially a political role."
Collins drew up a list of questions to ask Rice at their one-on-one hourlong meeting slated for Wednesday. She
wants Rice to explain how she could promote a story "with such certitude" about a spontaneous demonstration
over the anti-Muslim video that was so at odds with the classified information to which the ambassador had
access. (It was also at odds with common sense, given that there were Al Qaeda sympathizers among the rebel
army members that overthrew Muarrunar el-Qaddafi with help from the U.S. — an intervention advocated by
Rice — and Islamic extremist training camps in the Benghazi area.)
The F.B.I. interviewed survivors of the attack in Germany and, according to some senators, had done most of
the interviews of those on site by Sept. 15, the day before Rice went on TV, and established that there was no
protest. Collins wants to learn if the F.B.I. had failed to communicate that, or if they had communicated it and
Rice went ahead anyway?
When Rice heard the president of the Libyan National Congress tell Bob Schieffer on "Face the Nation," right
before her appearance, that 50 people had been arrested who were either foreign or affiliated with or
sympathized with Al Qaeda, why did she push back with the video story? "Why wouldn't she think what the
Libyan president said mattered?" Collins wondered.
Why did Rice say on ABC News's "This Week," that "two of the four Americans who were killed were there
providing security"? Rice was referring to the two ex-Navy SEAL team members who were C.I.A. security
officers working on a base about a mile away. "They weren't there to protect Ambassador Stevens," Collins
said. "That wasn't their job."
Rice also said that "we had a substantial security presence with our personnel" — which was clearly not the
case. Collins wants to know Rice's basis for saying on ABC that the attacks were "a direct result of a heinous
and offensive video." And why did she say "a small number of people" came to the consulate to protest, when
that phrase is not in her talking points? Collins is curious why Rice is not angrier, if, as she insists, she was
repeating what she was told. "I'd be furious at the White House and F.B.I. and intelligence community for
destroying my credibility," the senator said.
Collins said that before she would support Rice for secretary of state, she needs to ascertain what was really
going on. "Did they think admitting that it was an Al Qaeda attack would destroy the narrative of Libya being a
big success story?" Collins asked. As one of the administration champions of intervening in Libya, Rice was
surely rooting for that success story herself.

December 4, 2012 Tuesday
Regional Edition
SECTION: EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A25
HEADLINE: It's not about Rice
BYLINE: Richard Cohen
BODY:
In 1953, an Army officer by the name of Irving Peress was promoted from captain to major. Peress was a
leftist, possibly a communist, and word of his advancement in rank reached Sen. Joseph McCarthy in
Washington. He asserted that the promotion proved the Army was "soft on communism," and he launched an
investigation that transfixed the nation. Peress, by the way, was a mere dentist. He was the Susan Rice of his
day.
Rice, of course, is a much more substantial figure. She is the U.N. ambassador, a friend of Barack Obama's
and a member of his Cabinet. Still, the attack on her is so disproportionate to what she is accused of having
done - just what was it, exactly? - that as in the Peress case, you have to conclude that there is something more
at work.
At first, I thought we were witnessing just another example of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) doing his
Rumpelstiltskin number - throwing a fit and stomping his feet. It was McCain who first leveled the solemn
charge that Rice had lied to the Sunday TV shows about the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya.
She had characterized it as a spontaneous riot when it was, in fact, a planned attack by a local al-Qaeda affiliate.
But Rice was hewing to the early line established by the intelligence community. If the CIA and others were
wrong - or deceptive - then so, inevitably, was she.
Just as surely as day follows night, McCain's broadside was echoed by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). It
was soon taken up by 97 Republicans in the House who found Rice unqualified to become secretary of state - a
post to which she has not been nominated. "Ambassador Rice is widely viewed as having willfully or
incompetently misled the American public," they bellowed.
I think Rice would make a dandy secretary of state. She's close to the president, and that matters a great
deal. But she is also seen as overly political and that, as much as her version of Benghazi, is what troubles some
others. Oddly enough, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), a former presidential candidate and another potential
secretary of state, is seen as much more of a statesmen. He is indeed an independent foreign-policy thinker who
has, as in days of old, restored the prestige and importance of the Foreign Relations Committee, of which he is
chairman.
But the awful truth is that it hardly matters who Obama chooses. Foreign policy is run from the White
House and not the State Department. Hillary Clinton is about to retire, and while she has done a commendable

job at Foggy Bottom, we cannot expect the inevitable book by her to reveal a Clinton Doctrine. For the most
part, she executed, not initiated, foreign policy.
So what is this fuss all about? Not Rice, that's for sure. It has turned instead into an expression of unease
about Obarna's foreign policy and its politicization. The unfortunate Peress came to personify the government's
alleged indifference to the (equally alleged) communist infiltration of the military and virtually everything else
(with the possible exception of the American Legion), Similarly, Rice has become the personification of
unhappiness with the use of intelligence leaks to buff Obanaa's foreign policy image and the conducting of an
amorphous foreign policy. Like Churchill's famous pudding, it lacks theme.
Syria is an example. U.S. inaction has allowed the crisis to fester. Bashar al-Assad's regime might be
dusting off its formidable arsenal of chemical weapons, further evidence of how chaotic this crisis has become,
but much of the time the White House has just trailed after Turkey or France. The war has spread, a refugee
calamity has developed, 40,000 people have died, and jihadists have come to play a prominent role. The Obarna
administration has been as lethargic on Syria as it initially was with Libya.
This sense of an aimless foreign policy, one lacking any moral fervor (or fiber) irritates conservatives much
more than liberals. It certainly enrages McCain, who cannot stomach the big guys kicking little guys around. He
sees an administration that will not engage the American people on matters of foreign policy - make a case for
intervention, not just say it's too hard to do.
The attack on Rice is unfair and excessive. But the issue is not the person but what she represents - in this
case, the administration's 'mobility to articulate a foreign policy that marries American morality to American
power, not merely American politics.

Subject: Inquiry Into Libya Attack Is Sharply Critical of State Dept. (NYT)
WASHINGTON (New York Times) - An independent inquiry into the attack on the United States diplomatic
mission in Libya that killed four Americans on Sept. 11 sharply criticizes the State Department for a lack of
seasoned security personnel and relying on untested local militias to safeguard the compound, Congressional
and State Department officials said Tuesday night
The investigation into the attacks on the diplomatic mission and C.LA. annex that killed Ambassador I.
Christopher Stevens and three others also faulted State Department officials in Washington for ignoring
requests from officials at the American Embassy in Tripoli for more guards and safety upgrades to the
diplomatic mission.
The panel also blamed the State Department for waiting for specific warnings of imminent attacks to act
rather than adapting security procedures and protocols to a deteriorating security environment By this spring,
Benghazi, a hotbed of militant activity in eastern Libya, had experienced a string of assassinations and attacks,
including one on a British envoy's motorcade.
Finally, the report also blamed two major State Department bureaus — diplomatic security and Near Eastern
affairs — for failing to coordinate and plan adequate security at the mission. The panel also determined that a
number of officials had shown poor leadership.
In response to the panel's findings, Secretary of State Hillary Rodhana Clinton said in a letter to Congress
that she was acceptiung all 29 of the panel's recommendations, several of which are classified.
Mrs. Clinton is taking specific steps to correct the problems, according to officials. They say the State
Department is asking permission from Congress to transfer $1.3 billion from funds that had been allocated for
spending in Iraq. This includes $553 million for additional Marine security guards; $130 million for diplomatic
security personnel; and $691 million for improving security at installations abroad.
On Monday, an independent panel that was established to investigate the attack presented the report to the
State Department. The panel, called an accountability review board, is led by Thomas R. Pickering, a veteran
diplomat. It includes four other members, among them Mike Mullen, the retired admiral who served as
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The board is authorized by a 1986 lavv intended to strengthen security at
United States diplomatic missions.
The State Department sent a lengthy classified version of the report to Congress on Tuesday. Mr. Pickering
and Admiral Mullen are scheduled to meet with members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and
House Foreign Affairs Committee in closed session on Wednesday.
On Thursday, William J. Burns and Thomas R Nides, both deputy secretaries of States, will testitY to both
panels. Mrs. Clinton, who is stillrecovering from a concussion she suffered last week after fainting while sick
from a stomach flu, is at home this week. The head of the House panel, Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a
Florida Republican, however, has made clear that she planned to ask Mrs. Clinton to testify at a future time

VAN SUSTEREN: Senator, there is a report from the State Department that Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton will testify on Benghazi before the middle of January. There has been some criticism of whether or
not she has a concussion. I believe she has a concussion. What do you think?
MCCAIN: I know that in my view, Secretary Clinton, when she said she assumed full responsibility, she
certainly has a lot of responsibility for what happened in Benghazi. That's -- that report made that very
clear. But I must say, I have never seen Secretary Clinton back down from a fight. And I have
never seen her back down. And / believe that she is now not physically well enough to testify
and she will testify the middle of January.

The other set is for Greg Craig, which stresses Goodwin's progressive credentials as he likely will find that
more appealing.

Just saw a portion of S interview with Jorge Ramos. She hit the ball out of the park on the question framed around
Enrique Krauze's NYT op-ed today about US moral hypocrisy. I don't think he was expecting her to give a categorical
answer and address the issue head on. They teased her response to a question about Chavez's comment that Obama is
ignorant. They will air it in Ramos' Sunday talk show. My mom saw the Telemundo interview with Sevcec. She said that
one was more personal and friendly.
Meanwhile, the coverage out of Mexico City featured Espinosa welcoming the WH announcement today as consistent
with the overall policy goals while calling on us to do more.
Did she do Patricia Junot of CNN en Espanol?
You've prob seen the promo: Anderson Cooper is reporting from the border 'the war next door" for the next two days.
They had a pretty dramatic set-up piece today.

Poll: Clinton has high job approval
http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/03/25/clinton.poll/
(CNN) -- As Hillary Clinton flies to Mexico for a high-level summit, a new national poll indicates seven in 10 Americans are happy with
the job she's doing as secretary of state.
Seventy-one percent of people questioned in a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Wednesday said they approve of how
Clinton is handling her job as America's top diplomat. Fewer than one in four disapprove.
"Nine in 10 Democrats approve of Clinton -- that's no surprise," said Keating Holland, CNN's polling director. "But by a 50 percent to 43
percent margin, Republicans also think she is doing a good job at the State Department. That's an interesting result for a polarizing
figure like Clinton."
The poll's release comes as Clinton teams up with Mexican officials to kick off weeks of meetings intended to find ways to fight drug
violence on both sides of the U.S.-Mexican border. The Obama administration on Tuesday announced a major increase in security
funding and agent deployments along the border. '--

"Since taking office in January, Clinton has been at the White House nearly every day, meeting with President Obama, Vice President
[Joseph] Biden and other members of the Cabinet and national security staff," said CNN State Department producer Elise Labott. "The
secretary maintains close ties with her former colleagues on Capitol Hill and meets regularly with congressional leaders."
The former first lady, senator from New York and one-time primary rival to Obama already has clocked close to 60,000 miles in her first
two trips overseas -- one journey to China, the other to the Middle East and Europe -- since becoming secretary of state in January.
Clinton was met by large crowds and warmly received by world leaders on both trips, although "she met some criticism in Beijing, where
she was criticized for a lower-key approach that seemed to downplay the importance of human rights in the overall relationship with
China," Labott said.
"Her aides said she wanted a new approach to dealing with China's human rights record, including less public criticism and more
private discussions, which may prove more productive in changing Chinese behavior."
Clinton's approval rating is higher than that of her boss: The same CNN/Opinion Research poll put Obama's approval rating at 64
percent, 7 percentage points lower than Clinton's.
Clinton has a couple of advantages over Obama in public opinion today, Holland said.

"She hasn't had a prominent role in the administration's economic or budget policies," he said. "There haven't been any international
issues that have caused as much outrage as the AIG bonuses. And her name wasn't on the ballot in November, so any partisan
animosity to her that is left over from 2008 is not as fresh in the public's mind."
Clinton's approval rating is also 10 percentage points higher than the one her predecessor, Condoleezza Rice, had in March 2005, then
two months into her tenure as secretary of state.
The CNN/Opinion Research poll of 1,019 Americans was conducted by telephone March 12-15. The survey's sampling error is plus or
minus 3 percentage points.

Dangerous Thoughts
Obama's Personnel Problem
Dan Gerstein, 03.25.09, 12:01 AM ET
The especially rocky week that President Obama just experienced has led many political observers to
ask what happened to the fabled discipline candidate Obama showed during the campaign and on
into the transition. How did he and his vaunted political machine go from "No Drama Obama" to
bailout bonus blunders, Tim Geithner death watches and Special Olympic insults in less than two
months? •
The easy answer is that circumstances have changed, and there is a lot of truth to that. Governing is
fundamentally different than campaigning—particularly in the pressure cooker of an economic
meltdown. But that's exactly why I would argue that the president's escalating execution troubles are
really a function of what has largely stayed the same since the election--the mismatched,
understaffed team of loyalists around him.
Indeed, as best I can tell, Obama has more than a Geithner problem. He has what I would call a
Rumsfeld problem. That is to say, in the infamous words of the imperious defense secretary, the
president made the mistake of going to economic war with the army he had—which was built for
political speed and presidential comfort—instead of the army he needs to beat back the crisis of
confidence that is crippling our markets and feeding the AIG blood lust.
This is not a question of having good personnel. Obama had some of the best minds working in
politics and policy helping him take down Hillary Clinton and John McCain. And it's only natural he
would want to bring many of them into his White House to help run his government, much like most
every modern president has done.
•Rather, it's a question of having the right personnel in the right place to make the best case for
Obama's complicated and challenging economic agenda--and perhaps most important, to persuade

the American people to swallow their anger along with another round of distasteful but necessary
bailouts.
By that measure, if you step back and look at Obama's sales force, it seems pretty clear so far that
the president has the wrong mix of credibility, diversity and sensitivity for this seller's market. That's
true for Treasury, for the White House and, most acutely, across the airwaves.
Geithner, who joined Team Obama on the late side last November, has been the obvious poster child
for this problem. But he is far from alone.
Both Geithner and Larry Summers, who advised Obama during much of the campaign, have proven
to be ineffective and at times damaging advocates for the president's policies. That's in part because
of their uneven communications skills. But the bigger problem, critics on the right and left now agree,
is that these two brilliant experts are too close to the Wall Street elites they are trying to rescue to
procure the pound of contrition the public is demanding in exchange for more bailout money. Hence
the tin ear for AIG's gilded ripoff.
The White House's top talking heads have the opposite limitation: They are too removed from
workings of the financial system to speak credibly about it.
Press Secretary Robert Gibbs is by all accounts a talented political operative, who shone during the
campaign. But unlike some of his recent predecessors--such as Clinton spokesman Mike McCurry
(State Department) and Bush spokesman An Fleischer (House Ways and Means Committee)--Gibbs
does not have any high-level policy experience. And according to Clinton refugees I know who now
work on Wall Street, Gibbs' lack of financial literacy too often shows in his vague, halting answers to
tough bailout questions. That's not his fault. He's just the wrong fit for this trust-building role.
Obama's chief strategist, David Axelrod, has a similar knowledge deficit. To be sure, Axelrod is one of
the most intuitive and resonant message meisters in the country, and few are better at doing political
battle on the Sunday shows. But he has never worked in business or government, and just does not
have the facility or standing of a Leon Panetta or even a David Gergen to make the case for a
complex initiative like the bank rescue program the administration unveiled on Monday.
Obama is suffering from not having a Gergen--in more ways than one. Indeed, when it comes to
domestic issues, this White House often appears more a team of radicals than rivals. Forget about a
Republican counterweight in Obama's inner circle--there does not seem to be any evidence even of a
Democratic contrarian among the campaign loyalists and liberal acolytes in the West Wing.
That is to say, the kind of independent thinker who would have pushed Obama to veto the earmark-
laden, omnibus-pending bill that wound up making him look like a hypocrite; or to announce a list of
programs the president would be cutting or eliminating before he released his budget to show he was
serious about fiscal balance and discipline. Not to triangulate, but to reanimate the country-over-party
spirit Obama widely inspired last year and to reassure millions of centrist supporters who have
Understandable qualms about the dramatic expansion of deficit spending the president is pursuing.
That lack of perspective is compounded by the lack of people in key positions in major agencies. And
no one has paid a bigger price for that than Geithner, as Obama himself acknowledged in his 60
Minutes interview Sunday. Without any top political appointees in place at Treasury, Geithner had no
one to bail him out on the AIG mess--to make up for his tone-deafness, monitor the bonus process
and prod him to nip the issue in the bud before it could explode into a capital-eating and capital-
wasting fireball.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760595 Date: 06/30/2015
The obvious solution to these sales force problems would be the kind of major shakeup Clinton
instituted following the collapse of his health care plan and the drubbings Democrats took in the 1994
midterms, which brought in Panetta, Gergen and a handful of other old-hand pragmatists. Some will
say it's too early to press the eject button, but you could just as easily argue that this is not a learning
curve problem that is going to improve with time.
Nevertheless, it's just not realistic to expect Obama to take emergency measures now, especially
after the president unequivocally expressed his support for Geithner and the markets rallied around
the rollout of the Treasury secretary's toxic asset plan. So I would bet on Obama to opt for addition
over subtraction, and, instead of firing his top salesmen, to bring in more fine-tuned and effective
reinforcements to pitch Congress, the press and the public on his behalf.
Ideally, that would mean elevating someone like Paul Volcker, who is currently chairing Obama's
recovery advisory group, into the public face of the president's recovery program. The former Fed
chairman projects strength, confidence and legitimacy in ways that Geithner never could. He is not
tainted by the original Bush bailout packages. And he is clearly the most credible spokesman on
financial matters within the Obama orbit.
Best of all, because Volcker is already on the team, his elevation would be seen as a shift, not a
shakeup, and give Geithner breathing room to do his best wonk work.
The president would also be well-served, as long as the financial crisis is going on, to take some of
the burden off of Gibbs. One option: split the daily press briefings into two. Let Gibbs continue
handling the general part of the briefing, and then bring in a specialist to handle the economic portion
of the program.
Someone like McCurry, the gold standard of recent White House spokesmen; or, as one Clinton alum
suggested, Howard Schloss, a former assistant secretary for public affairs at the Treasury under
Clinton and now the head of communications for the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
Splitting the briefing duties may seem a little unconventional. But these are hardly normal times.
Besides, you didn't see the White House press secretary doing the Pentagon briefings during the last
two wars with Iraq.
It's this general posture, more than any specific move, that will most help Obama reduce the drama,
reassert his primacy and, not least of all, avoid repeating the worst mistakes of the Rumsfeld reign.
We know too well what happens when a president sticks with the same ineffective team and the
same failed strategy purely out of loyalty and stubborness.
If this is no time for politics as usual, as the president has rightly said, it should be no time for political
staffing as usual, either. Want policies that work? Get the army you need to win.

Jorge Ramos led Univision's evening broadcast by saying that SecState HRC's visit had pleasantly surprised the Mexican
people. The ensuing piece, by the network's correspondent in Mex city, went on to cover the highlights of the visit, with
an emphasis on her admission of the US role in the drug problem. It was noted that she went down to take responsibility
not apportion blame or criticize Mexico. The basillica stop also got excellent coverage as a rightful tribute to a central

Kerry, Lugar Amendment To Restore Full Funding To President Obama's
International Affairs Budget
Washington, DC – Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry, on the Senate floor today
introduced an amendment to restore four billion dollars in cuts to the President's international affairs budget.
The senator's full remarks as prepared are below:
If the first years of the twenty-first century have taught us anything about national security, it is that in a
globalized world, our problems are interconnected, and so—ultimately—is our security. We are endangered by
weak and failed states as well as by strong states. We are endangered by diseases and climate change emissions
half a world away. We are endangered when we allow chaos and crisis to create the conditions for ideologies of
radical hatred and violence to take root. And it is clear to all that meeting these global challenges will require
far more than our military: it will require a strengthened commitment to diplomacy and development.
To put this as simply and bluntly as possible, that's why passing a robust foreign affairs budget is a matter not
just of America's world leadership, but also of our national security. But don't take my word for it:
Ask our Secretary of Defense, Bob Gates. He said: "What is clear to me is that there is a need for a dramatic
increase in spending on the civilian instruments of national security – diplomacy, strategic communications,
foreign assistance, civic action, and economic reconstruction and development."
Ask our Secretary of State and former colleague, Hillary Clinton, who testified in her confirmation hearing that
"the relatively small but important amount of money we do spend on foreign aid is in the best interests of the
American people" and "promotes our national security and advances our interests and reflects our values."
When our soldiers and generals join our top diplomats in demanding increased civilian capacity and increased
civilian funding—even in the midst of an economic crisis— that's when you know there is not just a growing
consensus, but a real sense of urgency behind strengthening our civilian mission.
Returning diplomacy and development to their rightful place cannot be achieved through words alone: It takes
money to drive civilian foreign policy—and if it keeps us safer, as I believe it will, then that is money well
spent.
Full funding of the President's international affairs budget is a vital step toward greater civilian capacity, and I
urge my colleagues to support it. That's why, along with Senators Lugar, Leahy, Voinovich, Durbin, Kaufman,
Menendez, Dodd, Feinstein, Brown, Sanders, Lieberman, Casey, and Corker, I ask for approval of this
amendment to restore $4 billion worth of funding to the President's FY 2010 international affairs budget request
for the Function 150 Account. The offset here will come from the Function 920 Account.
The reality is that right now, we are not doing nearly enough to invest in diplomacy and development. That's
the finding of numerous studies conducted inside and outside of government. Funding for the Department of
Defense is over half a trillion dollars. In 2008, the Army added about 7,000 soldiers to its total; that's more
people than serve in the entire American Foreign Service. 1,100 Foreign Service officers could be hired for the
cost of a single C-17 military cargo plane. And four billion dollars is less than two percent of what the
government has given to AIG.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760665 Date: 06/30/2015
That is vital context for any discussion of the President's proposed increase in the international affairs
budget. The President requested $53.8 billion in FY 2010 to fund next year's budget—an increase of 8%, or $4
billion, over last year's funding level of $49.8 billion.
We must recognize just what a small share of our overall spending the President's international affairs budget
comprises: 1.4% of the total FY 2010 Budget and only 6.8% of the "national security budget," which includes
defense and homeland security. Even with this year's proposed increase in funding, the international affairs
budget still represents just 0.35% of GDP. This sliver of our budget funds all State Department operations,
foreign aid and foreign policy programs, our diplomatic programs, global health initiatives on HIV/AIDS,
Malaria and Tuberculosis programs, and humanitarian assistance to help stabilize fragile states, reduce global
poverty and assist refugees.
Some have described the President's request as a 41% increase from last year's budget of $38 billion, but that
simply isn't accurate: The figure of $38 billion doesn't include last year's supplemental appropriations, which
raise the total to nearly $50 billion. The President's FY 2010 budget includes supplemental
appropriations. That's why the actual increase is only $4 billion, or 8%. When we talk about changes in
spending, we have to compare apples to apples.
What's more, the President should be commended for following through on his pledge to enhance transparency
and improve fiscal discipline by shifting supplemental appropriations into a single budget. This is a more
straightforward way of doing business that doesn't seek to hide or massage spending figures by tucking extra
spending into supplemental bills. That is why my colleague Senator Conrad, the Chairman of the Budget
Committee, has been vocal in praising this new approach.
But the real question we are facing today is what will this extra $4 billion get us? This $4 billion will bring
vital foreign aid increases to programs in Pakistan and Afghanistan. This $4 billion will build civilian capacity
and put our diplomats back on the front lines of American foreign policy. This $4 billion will provide life
saving treatment for people with HIV/AIDS and supports broad prevention efforts that save lives every
day. This $4 billion will help make people all over the world safer, and in the process, it will help keep
America safer.
Of course, some will claim that in the midst of a global economic crisis, we do not have the luxury of leading on
the global stage. But this is precisely the moment when our investment is most needed—and it is also a
moment when our leadership and our economic system face the greatest challenge. And ultimately, efforts in
the developing world win us influence and respect, and they also contribute to the growth and stability of future
consumers of our products and future trading partners.
There is scarcely a corner of the globe where our efforts are not impacted by this budget:
In Afghanistan and Pakistan, we must finally reverse years of neglect and drift.
Imagine a nation as populous as Iraq, Afghanistan and North Korea—combined. A nation with a full arsenal of
nuclear weapons, and ballistic missiles capable of delivering them anywhere in a thousand- kilometer
range. Imagine a nation whose population is overwhelmingly moderate, overwhelmingly committed to
democracy and rule of law—but deeply suspicious of its leadership, and of America's friendship. Imagine a
nation in which Osama bin Laden and the leadership of Al Qaeda has found sanctuary for the past seven
years—a haven from which they and their confederates have plotted and carried out attacks on their host
country, on neighboring countries, and on sites around the globe.
This nation could serve the keystone for a new, cooperative relationship between the Western and Muslim
worlds—or become an epicenter for radicalism and violence on a cataclysmic scale. Now imagine that

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760665 Date: 06/30/2015
America took a long, hard look at the status quo of our policy towards a nation at just such a crossroads—and
decided to do nothing different.
• We need a bold, new strategy for Pakistan: Our current path has not brought success, and simply tinkering
around the margins is guaranteed to fail. We have little choice but to think big. That is why President Obama
called on Congress to pass the Enhanced Partnership With Pakistan Act that Sen. Lugar and I will introduce
very soon: It will authorize $1.5 billion annually, in order to help shape a new relationship with
Pakistan. Without the full authorization of the President's budget, even a priority as vital as this one could be
shunted aside.
We are not the only ones vying for influence. You know who else understands clearly how powerful a weapon
foreign aid can be? Iran does. That's why after its proxy Hezbollah provoked Israel's bombing of Lebanon,
they painted the green Hezbollah flag on houses all over Lebanon—houses they plan to rebuild, largely with
Iranian money. If we don't spend money on aid, we are surrendering the field to those who do.
Nor can we afford to abandon our efforts against global AIDS. We know that PEPFAR has won America
friends and allies across Africa and the world we know that AIDS contributes to failed states, not to mention
incalculable human misery amongst the sick and dying and the orphans they leave behind—and that is why our
national interest and our moral interest demand that we deliver on our commitments at a moment of
crisis. Last year, both parties came together to authorize up to $48 billion over five years. Today, it is
imperative that we do all we can to fund these programs. If we don't, we will freeze enrollment of patients into
life-saving antiretroviral treatment. Meanwhile, prevention efforts –the most cost-effective way to stop AIDS
from ravaging a society—will be the first ones cut. And tragically, we know what will happen next: more
people will contract HIV, and more will die from AIDS-related illnesses.
Refugees and human rights advocates also need our help. Economic support funds are vital to support those
living inside countries with repressive regimes, like Burma and Zimbabwe. We know that refugees and
displaced populations can be the spark for large-scale violence, and today we face that very threat from the
millions displaced from homes in Iraq. Our Migration and Refugee Assistance is more important than ever to
help us provide immediate, effective assistance to these vulnerable populations.
Our international affairs budget will also have profound implications for another national security issue that will
only grow in importance: the threat of global climate change. This December, the global community will be
meeting in Copenhagen to create a new international agreement to address the urgent threat of global climate
change. The science is screaming at us: we have no time to lose if we hope to avert catastrophe. If we want to
persuade the developing nations of the world to do what is necessary and in all of our interests— we must help
them to respond now to the impacts of the crisis that are already being felt globally—and to preemptively make
the dramatic technological changes across their economies that this threat demands.
Our leverage at the negotiating table in Copenhagen will depend directly on our ability to offer a strong
financing package. Negotiators are meeting for an interim session this week in Bonn, and it is essential that we
send a clear signal that the United States Congress is serious about financing to support the commitments the
Obama Administration makes on the world stage—and serious about being part of the global solution to one of
the greatest threats we face.
We also need more diplomats and aid officers to troubleshoot on the front lines. The 2010 budget also marks
the first year of a new commitment to a significant increase in the size of the Foreign Service at both the State
Department and USAID. Today we are barely covering attrition rates. We have asked these agencies to
expand their missions and operations into new theaters like Iraq and Afghanistan—and we need to expand their
resources accordingly.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760665 Date: 06/30/2015
Even as we face long-term security threats such as climate change, we must also address the immediate and
urgent threats of nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism. The President's budget provides additional
nonproliferation and counter-proliferation funding to secure nuclear materials around the world, and to fund
new and ongoing initiatives to build the counterterrorism capacity of partnering countries to do the
same. That's how you leverage our civilian spending to keep America safe.
Surveying the wide range of commitments and aspirations this budget addresses, it is clear that our challenge is
immense. And yet, even as we confront a crisis here at home, we cannot afford to delay the task of restoring our
leadership, returning to our best traditions of civilian outreach, and restoring our influence and authority. We
cannot afford to come up short on our promises to allies, to vulnerable populations, and to the world. We
cannot try to be a world leader on the cheap. If we fail to do our part to solve the world's problems, those
problems will eventually find us here at home.
From pandemics to climate change to failed states, this century's security challenges demand that a new level of
commitment to diplomacy and development. With this relatively small investment, we are making significant
strides toward restoring America's leadership role in the world. It will make the world safer, and it will make
us safer. And so I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the President's budget request.

THE PRESIDING OFFICER: WHO YIELDS TIME IN OPPOSITION TO THE
AMENDMENT?
THE SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA.
MR. CONRAD: MR. PRESIDENT, WHEN THE SENATOR APPROACHED ME ABOUT
THIS YESTERDAY, I TOLD HIM THAT I WOULD STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS
AMENDMENT. AND I TOLD HIM THAT BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN HARD TO
PUT TOGETHER, AND WE'VE TRIED TO HAVE AN EQUAL SHARING OF
SACRIFICE BETWEEN ALL OF THE SPENDING ELEMENTS OF A BUDGET.
WE'VE TRIED TO DO IT WITH RESPECT TO DOMESTIC SPENDING, DEFENSE
SPENDING. WE'VE TRIED TO DO IT WITH MANDATORY SPENDING. AND
INTERNATIONAL IS A COMPONENT OF THE DISCRETIONARY SIDE OF THE
BUDGET, SO WE THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY FAIR THAT THEY BE ASKED TO
MAKE A CONTRIBUTION. NOW, WHEN I TOLD THE SENATOR YESTERDAY
THAT I WOULD STRONGLY RESIST THIS AMENDMENT, I DID NOT KNOW, I
WAS NOT AWARE THAT HE HAD AN OFFSET FOR THAT AM AMENDMENT, AND
THAT DOES ALTER THE SITUATION. THAT MAKES IT MORE PALATABLE
BECAUSE WE MAINTAIN THE SAME BOTTOM LINE. BUT IT DOES CONCERN
ME THAT WE ARE UPSETTING THE BALANCE OF WHAT I THINK IS A FAIR
DISTRIBUTION OF THE PAIN OF THE CUTBACKS THAT WE HAVE HAD TO
MAKE. AND I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT. I AM CONCERNED
THAT, YOU KNOW, OTHER PARTS OF THE BUDGET ARE BEING ASKED TO
TAKE REDUCTIONS FROM THE PRESIDENT'S REQUEST AND NOW
INTERNATIONAL WILL NOT. SO I JUST WANT TO SAY, I FIND THAT
TROUBLING. I UNDERSTAND ABSOLUTELY THE SUBSTANCE OF THE
ARGUMENT THAT THE SENATOR IS MAKING, AND HE IS RIGHT TO MAKE
IT. HE IS CHAIRMAN OF THE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE, BUT I DO
HOPE THAT COLLEAGUES THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT KIND OF THE EQUITY
OF THE BURDEN HERE. THE EQUITY OF THE BURDEN. THE SECOND THING
I WANT TO SAY WITH RESPECT TO THIS AMENDMENT IS IT USES A 920
OFFSET. AND WE CAME OUT OF THE COMMITTEE WITH ABOUT $7 BILLION
IN SAVINGS IN 920. THAT'S GENERAL OVERHEAD OF ALL OF THE
AGENCIES. IN OTHER WORDS, ITS A ACROSS THE BOARD -- IT'S ACROSS
THE BOARD, GOES TO THEIR OVERHEAD ACCOUNTS AND COULD WE TAKE

SOMEWHAT MORE IN 920?
YES, BUT NOT MUCH MORE. BUT NOT MUCH MORE. WE CAME OUT OF THE
COMMITTEE AT $7 BILLION. I'VE ALWAYS TRIED TO STAY AT ABOUT $10
BILLION IN 920. THIS WOULD TAKE US TO $11 BILLION. AND SO I'M
TROUBLED BY THAT AS WELL. WITH THAT SAID, I DON'T -- I DON'T
INTEND TO OPPOSE THIS AMENDMENT, BUT I DO FIND IT TROUBLING ON
THOSE TWO GROUNDS. ONE, IT DOES AFFECT THE FAIRNESS OF THE
DISTRIBUTION OF THE PAIN, IF YOU WILL, OF THE CUTBACKS WE'VE
HAD TO MAKE. AND, NUMBER TWO, IT ADDS TO THE SECTION 920
OFFSETS IN A WAY THAT, TO ME, TAKES IT A LITTLE PAST THE REALM
OF WHAT'S REASONABLE. BUT WITH THAT SAID, I DON'T INTEND TO
OPPOSE THIS AMENDMENT AND ASK COLLEAGUES TO VOTE AGAINST IT. I
YIELD THE FLOOR.

From The Economist print edition
Barack Obama may at last be getting a grip. But he still needs to show more leadership, at
home and abroad
HILLARY CLINTON'S most effective quip, in her long struggle with Barack Obama for the
Democratic nomination last year, was that the Oval Office is no place for on-the-job
training. It went to the heart of the nagging worry about the silver-tongued young
senator from Illinois: that he lacked even the slightest executive experience, and that in
his brief career he had never really stood up to powerful interests, whether in his home
city of Chicago or in the wider world. Might Mrs Clinton have been right about her foe?
Not altogether. In foreign policy in particular Mr Obama has already done some
commendable things. He has held out a sincere hand to Iran; he has ordered
Guantanamo closed within a year; he has set himself firmly against torture. He has, as
the world and this newspaper wanted, taken a less strident tone in dealing with friends
and rivals alike.
But at home Mr Obama has had a difficult start. His performance has been weaker than
those who endorsed his candidacy, including this newspaper, had hoped. Many of his
strongest supporters—liberal columnists, prominent donors, Democratic Party
stalwarts—have started to question him. As for those not so beholden, polls show that
independent voters again prefer Republicans to Democrats, a startling reversal of
fortune in just a few weeks. Mr Obama's once-celestial approval ratings are about where
George Bush's were at this stage in his awful presidency. Despite his resounding
electoral victory, his solid majorities in both chambers of Congress and the obvious
goodwill of the bulk of the electorate, Mr Obama has seemed curiously feeble.
Empty posts, weak policies

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760667 Date: 06/30/2015
There are two main reasons for this. The first is Mr Obama's failure to grapple as fast
and as single-mindedly with the economy as he should have done. His stimulus package,
though huge, was subcontracted to Congress, which did a mediocre job: too much of the
money will arrive too late to be of help in the current crisis. His budget, though in some
ways more honest than his predecessor's, is wildly optimistic. And he has taken too long
to produce his plan for dealing with the trillions of dollars of toxic assets which fester on
banks' balance-sheets.
The failure to staff the Treasury is a shocking illustration of administrative drift. There
are 23 slots at the department that need confirmation by the Senate, and only two have
been filled. This is not the Senate's fault. Mr Obama has made a series of bad picks of
people who have chosen or been forced to withdraw; and it was only this week that he
announced his candidates for two of the department's four most senior posts. Filling
such jobs is always a tortuous business in America, but Mr Obama has made it harder by
insisting on a level of scrutiny far beyond anything previously attempted. Getting the
Treasury team in place ought to have been his first priority.
Second, Mr Obama has mishandled his relations with both sides in Congress. Though he
campaigned as a centrist and promised an era of post-partisan government, that's not
how he has behaved. His stimulus bill attracted only three Republican votes in the
Senate and none in the House. This bodes ill for the passage of more difficult projects,
such as his big plans for carbon-emissions control and health-care reform. Keeping those
promises will soon start to bedevil the administration. The Republicans must take their
share of the blame for the breakdown. But if Mr Obama had done a better job of selling
his package, and had worked harder at making sure that Republicans were included in
drafting it, they would have found it more difficult to oppose his plans.
If Mr Obama cannot work with the Republicans, he needs to be certain that he controls
his own party. Unfortunately, he seems unable to. Put bluntly, the Democrats are
messing him around. They are pushing pro-trade-union legislation (notably a measure to
get rid of secret ballots) even though he doesn't want them to do so; they have been
roughing up the bankers even though it makes his task of fixing the economy much
harder; they have stuffed his stimulus package and his appropriations bill with pork,
even though this damages him and his party in the eyes of the electorate. Worst of all,
he is letting them get away with it.
Lead, dammit
There are some signs that Mr Obama's administration is learning. This week the battered
treasury secretary, Tim Geithner, has at last come up with a detailed plan to rescue the
banks (see article and article). Its success is far from guaranteed, and the mood of
Congress and the public has soured to the point where, should this plan fail, getting
another one off the drawing-board will be exceedingly hard. But the plan at least
demonstrates the administration's acceptance that it must work with the bankers,
instead of riding the wave of popular opinion against them, if it is to repair America's
economy. And it's not just in the domestic arena that Mr Obama has demonstrated his
willingness to learn: on Iraq, he has intelligently recalibrated his views, coming up with a

plan for withdrawal that seeks to consolidate the gains in Iraq while limiting the costs to
America.
But Mr Obama has a long way to travel if he is to serve his country—and the world—as
he should. Take the G20 meeting in London, to which he will head at the end of next
week. The most important task for this would-be institution is to set itself firmly against
protectionism at a time when most of its members are engaged in a game of creeping
beggar-thy-neighbour. Yet how can Mr Obama lead the fight when he has just pandered
to America's unions by sparking a minor trade war with Mexico? And how can he set a
new course for NATO at its 60th-anniversary summit a few days later if he is appeasing
his party with talk of leaving Afghanistan?
In an accomplished press conference this week, Mr Obama reminded the world what an
impressive politician he can be. He has a capacity to inspire that is unmatched abroad or
at home. He holds a strong hand when it comes to the Democrats, many of whom owe
their seats to his popularity at last year's election. Now he must play it.

Subject: Congratulations!
Francisco,
Just wanted to congratulate you and the entire team on a striking success. The Secretary's visit was jaw-dropping from
the Mexican perspective. I have never seen such a positive reaction to a visit by a high ranking US government
official. My personal favorite: Estamos hillarizados por estos dias.
There is obviously also a "show me the money" aspect of the reaction, but even Mexico's newspaper of the traditionally
anti-American left editorialized about "Good Clinton, Bad Napolitano".
And inside President Calderon's circle they are thrilled with Wednesday's meeting.
Many congratulations.
OK, I will stop bothering you with my emails and allow you to get back to doing your job.
warm regards,
Pamela

Many thanks for this. Your insights and suggestions are very helpful. While the Mexico left me with the impression
that we're aiming in the right direction (Leslie Bassett, Robert Jacobson and Tom Shannon are excellent), we could

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760678 Date: 06/30/2015
Dear Francisco,
I am sorry we did not have the chance to chat last week prior to the dinner, although I did see you at the end of the
table so now at least have a face in my head to go with your name.
I am writing you in the "follow-up" spirit that Sec. Clinton presented at the end of the dinner. I thought that a few
insights gleaned from having been in Mexico all this week might be of use to the secretary, although after my breakfast
with Leslie Bassett on Wednesday I am more convinced than ever that the Secretary is receiving high quality
information about Mexico from her embassy here. So there may not be that much for me to add, nevertheless...
I had breakfast Thursday with President Calderon's main foreign policy adviser, Rafael Fernandez de Castro, a very old
and good friend. He made two points I think are worth relaying to you and Anne-Marie:
1)As I mentioned at dinner, Mexico is impatient and President Calderon frustrated (more so now after the trucking
spat). To the extent that secretary Clinton can bring something tangible -- a sort of down payment on the kind of
relationship we would like to build with Mexico -- it would help enormously. In that context, Rafael reminded me that
President Calderon would very much like to be remembered as Mexico's first "Green President" (and is in something of a
competition with the Mayor of mexico City on this score).
2) rafael also related a very useful conceptuilization of President Calderon the man that I think will be of use to you:
he is a social conservative, Mexican nationalist (which by definition carries with it some anti-US sentiments) but also
harbors profound liberal values -- he is a true democrat (not all Mexican politicians are) and a strong supporter of free
trade and of a market economy that is largely free but regulated where required (which by definition carries some
sympathy for US values and Democratic party values), it is this dichotomy that defines him as a person and makes him
intelligible as a politician.
I also met with two female Senators who suggested to me the possibility of arranging a meeting between Sec. Clinton
and Mexico's female governors (2) and senators (about 20). In an obviously male-dominated society, they have been
working hard to promotewomen's issues and they think that the symbolism of a meeting with the secretary would help
their cause enormously. I agreed to pass the suggestion along in part becasue I am impressed by how these women --
from political parties that otherwise find it very hard to collaborate -- are cooperating across party lines to promote
women's issues, this kind of cross-party cooperation is much less common than it ought to be in Mexico's still formative
democracy. And it is obviously in the US interest to encourage this kind of behavior and thereby help solidify democratic
practices in Mexico. I know it is very late in your trip-planning to make this suggestion, but if there is not time for such
a meeting this trip, maybe for the next one.
I hope these musings were of some use.
Warm regards,
Pamela

Subject: Key development opinion research summarized
I've spent the last five years testing ideas and concepts to see how the development issue is understood by Americans
and what are the challenges. I care deeply about this, I got into politics because I was frustrated by how little I could help
living in a refugee camp on the Ethiopian-Somali border. The substantive policies obviously matter most, we got some
right and some wrong in Clinton years, but the results of our bipartisan research may be useful. Here's my super-concise
private summary:
1. The goal is help people be able to help themselves. The size of the program is important to advocates, but Americans
want to know the ultimate goal is to be helping people be able to care for themselves (like grow enough food for Africa).
2.We all agree that kids should be a key focus and the best reason for any program is the moral importance. It's fine to
acknowledge we do these programs for a variety of pragmatic reasons, but the most powerful reason is moral. It is the
right thing to do.
3.We mostly all agree it is ok to spend money on these programs, but we should always note how we are fighting for
reform too. The two concepts are not antagonists, but partners. And we are partners with other countries, this is not hand
outs. There are mutual responsibilities.
4.Corruption is a major reason why people, rightly, think the programs don't work.
5.Even as folks are skeptical of the big promise, they still want us to try.
Let me know if this is useful, we have a lot more insights if helpful. And I think this is the most important substantive issue
-- how to get these policies right.

SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON REMARKS TO THE HAITI DONORS CONFERENCE Washington, D.C.
Tuesday, April 14, 2009
For some of us, Haiti is a neighbor. For others, a place of historic and cultural ties. For all of us, a test of collective
commitment and resolve.
Some may ask why a small nation in the middle of the Caribbean Sea should command our attention today. Why
countries in the Western Hemisphere, Europe, the Middle East and Asia should offer assistance to Haiti in the midst of a
global economic downturn that has shaken us all.
We're gathered at this conference because what happens in Haiti will resound far beyond the Caribbean and beyond the
Americas. The success or failure of this one small nation has economic, social and political implications, not just for its 9
million citizens, but for a region whose future will be shaped by the strength of our commitment to achieve economic
recovery, political progress and wider opportunity for people from Portland to Porto Alegre to Port-au-Prince.
The United States is here, first and foremost, because it is the right thing to do for our neighbor and friend. Our ties to
Haiti reach back to the early years of both our nations and have endured for generations-through our struggles for
independence; through the defeat of slavery in Haiti, which inspired slaves and abolitionists in the U.S. to press on with
their fight for freedom; and more recently, through the hundreds of thousands of Haitians who emigrated to the United
States and strengthened it through their contributions in politics, business, science, sports and culture-the benefits of
which I experienced firsthand as a senator representing New York.
We are also here because we are committed to creating a hemisphere in which every nation-no matter their present
level of wealth or current political circumstances-is moving in the same direction, toward greater peace, prosperity,
freedom and opportunity.
With Haiti, we have the chance through global cooperation and collaboration to stand in solidarity with a people who
are seeking to march forward. A nation where small investments and assistance from other countries are beginning to
reap dividends in economic growth, wider access to health care, stronger governmental institutions, greater safety and
security-and the higher quality of life that results when the material conditions of people's lives improve.
Today, Haiti is the poorest nation in the hemisphere, with one of the region's biggest gaps between the haves and have-
nots. But in 2006, Haiti had its highest economic growth since the 1990s. It is on track to reach the completion point for
the IMF's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative in the next few months, which means significant debt relief is on the

way, which will free up approximately $4 million a month-money that Haiti can invest directly in improving the lives of
its people and building a future of self-sufficiency and confidence.
Haiti has the region's highest rate of HIV/AIDS, the highest rate of maternal mortality, and the highest rate of child
mortality. But the numbers of HIV infections and child and maternal deaths are all coming down.
Not long ago, Haiti endured three decades of a brutal dictatorship. But the national and presidential elections in 2006
jump-started Haiti's democracy, and President Preval and Prime Minister Pierre Louis are seeking to maintain a strong
commitment to democratic governance, which will take another step forward on Sunday with elections for the Senate.
Like many nations, including the United States, Haiti struggles against crime, particularly the global scourge of drug
trafficking. But reforms to improve policing, strengthen the justice system and fight corruption are now underway, and
a peacekeeping force led by Brazil has helped bring stability to many Haitian communities.
Haiti made these strides with help from its own citizens and many of the nations and institutions represented here
today. And this progress did not come only through government-to-government partnerships, but also through links
among businesses, universities, NG0s, religious and cultural groups, and individuals-the full range of resources and
relationships, which is the heart of smart power.
That trajectory of progress has been undermined by the combined winds of hurricanes and a global economic recession.
Haiti is in danger of stalling.
This conference gives us an opportunity to reignite its path to progress and work as a team-with Haiti at the helm-to
advance a comprehensive, long-term strategy for Haiti's growth, by coordinating hemispheric and international efforts,
targeting clear goals, and deploying our diverse skills and resources efficiently and effectively.
President Preval and Prime Minister Pierre Louis have identified what help Haiti needs to get back on track. With these
priorities as our guide and Haiti as our partner, we can make high-impact investments that will help lay the foundation
for stronger democratic institutions, a vibrant civil society, and an open market economy that creates more stability,
attracts international investment, and offers more jobs and wider economic opportunities for Haiti and our region as a
whole.
Now is the time to step up our investment in Haiti-not because the situation is so dire, but because the consequences of
inaction could lead to significantly larger costs in both human and financial terms down the road.
With $100, we can pay for a year of schooling for one Haitian child or immunize five. That's a tiny fraction of the cost of
solving these problems if they escalate over time.
The United States will target our support toward three areas that the Haitian government has requested, which are
aimed at promoting conditions that are essential for national and regional progress.
First, the Haitian people need to be secure. They must be able to travel safely to work and school and participate in the
civic lives of their communities without fear of violence.
Second, the country needs stronger infrastructure, particularly roads, which are the circulatory system of any robust
economy. Meanwhile, the people of Haiti are ready to work, but jobs are in short supply. We can accomplish two things
at once by putting people to work building roads and other infrastructure throughout Haiti.
And third, last year's hurricanes blew a hole in the government's budget.
Now Haiti is facing a huge deficit, which will make it harder to provide services in the short-term or fund major projects
in the long-term. Their debt obligations further constrain their ability to lay the groundwork for the future.
On each of these issues-security, jobs and infrastructure, and debt relief-the United States is lending its assistance and
seeking to partner with other nations to maximize our collective impact.

First, security. Effective international partnerships have already helped stem violence and improve security in Haiti. Cite
Soleil, for example, was a no-man's-land for years, but today, violence has subsided and a new sense of freedom is felt in
the streets.
The Haitian National Police have been supported in their work by the UN peacekeeping operation in Haiti, which is the
first in the hemisphere in which Latin American and Caribbean nations have participated. Brazil has led the mission with
determination and skill. This level of engagement and collaboration is a major step forward for our region.
But criminal networks operating in Haiti have not been eliminated. Haiti continues to fight drug traffickers who have
made this country a distribution point for illegal drugs headed to the United States, Canada and Europe.
Drug trafficking is a problem that involves many nations, all of which have a role to play in ending this deadly trade. That
includes the United States. We will give $2 million to fight drug trafficking in Haiti through the Merida Initiative, a plan
conceived by Mexico, Central America and the United States. This money will fund a secure communications network
for the Haitian police; provide a maritime base, vehicles and operational support for police drug units; provide training
to promote cross-border cooperation between Haiti and the Dominican Republic; and sharpen the investigation and
prosecution of drug crimes.
Once security is established, opportunity can take root. Nations from Canada to Spain to Japan offered generous
assistance to help repair the damage from last year's storms. Now it is time to take the next step-to move beyond
peacekeeping and disaster relief to long-term reconstruction and development.
Haiti has the highest unemployment rate in the hemisphere; 70 percent of its people don't have jobs. It also has one of
the region's highest population growth rates. Together, these trends have created what one development expert has
called a "youth tsunami"-nearly 1 million youths are expected to come into the job market in the next five years.
To spur the creation of jobs, the United States passed the HOPE Act in 2006, to give garments made in Haiti tariff-free
access to the U.S. market. Last October, we extended this trade preference for another decade. Apparel is one of the
largest sectors in Haiti's economy. We see great potential for job creation in this field, and we are gratified by Brazil's
interest in supporting the Haitian apparel industry as well.
But to build a diversified economy, Haiti needs more than trade deals. It also needs the infrastructure to support the
flow of goods and services. The roads in Haiti are beyond inadequate; many communities are isolated by the lack of a
passable road, which prevents people from holding jobs, children from going to school, and farmers from bringing their
crops to market.
Better roads could facilitate greater trade and bring more Haitians into the global economy.
Haiti also needs better roads in tourist areas, to promote that sector of the economy. Other urgent infrastructure needs
include digging water catchments to prevent floods, completing a garment workers' training center, and creating canals
to help irrigation.
As part of the $287 million in non-emergency assistance we will provide to Haiti this year, we have authorized $20
million in aid to generate jobs, to help people put their skills to work building their country's future. We look forward to
working with Haiti to distribute that money quickly and effectively, to trigger a virtuous circle for long-term economic
growth.
All the fiscal responsibility in the world can't prevent a natural disaster.
The hurricanes didn't just wash away crops and houses; they also washed away
months of government planning for the future. Haiti is facing an
approximately $50 million budget deficit, which could undermine Haiti's long-term ambitions as well as services that
people depend on to survive.

The United States will provide $20 million to pay Haiti's upcoming debt service obligations, to free Haiti to use its
resources to fill that budget gap.
[There is a fourth urgent need that the United States is committed to helping Haiti resolve. The combined effect of
rising food prices globally and the destruction of crops by the hurricanes have exposed millions of Haitians to
malnutrition and its destructive effects on health and productivity. Malnourished people are often too weak to work;
chronically hungry children struggle to learn in school. Food insecurity is not only a source of suffering, but a direct
threat to economic growth and global stability. The United States will provide a $15-million in-kind contribution of food
to help Haiti as it continues to rebuild. ]
These are some of the ways in which the United States is ready to partner with Haiti and other nations. But there are
additional pieces of the larger mission that need support-from helping Haiti adapt to climate change so future
hurricanes won't claim thousands of lives; to strengthening health systems; promoting sustainable agriculture; and
developing civil society.
This work is not only a matter for governments, but also a mission for our people. Here in the U.S., I have heard from
many individuals and groups who care about Haiti and want to help it develop but don't know how to invest their time
and money in a way that will make a real impact. We should think creatively about helping people outside government
get involved in a meaningful way with Haiti's future. Our people are our most valuable resource, and their potential to
help in places like Haiti has not yet been tapped.
We know from empirical data that small investments go a long way. This is something I've seen for myself in my own
visits to Haiti. I traveled there with my husband shortly after our wedding, and again years later as First Lady. I met a
doctor who had emigrated to the United States and became a U.S. Air Force Colonel, but returned to his home town of
Pignon to run a center for health, women's literacy and microcredit. He and his staff had few resources, but they
offered a comprehensive range of services to thousands of clients.
I visited a family-planning clinic where young people were trained to educate their peers about how to protect their
health and prevent teen pregnancy.
And I met with women from a group called Women in Democracy. These women had attended a global conference on
women's leadership in Montevideo, Uruguay, and when they returned home, they created this organization to support
Haitian women running for office.
Eleven years later, their organization is larger and stronger than ever, and so is their mission. In addition to supporting
women candidates, they also hold trade fairs for women entrepreneurs, run civic education programs to teach women
their rights, support women journalists, and build connections between women throughout the Caribbean.
These Haitian women remind us that we will never achieve real progress if we leave millions of people behind. And they
demonstrate a powerful commitment on the part of the Haitian people to participate in and lead their nation's recovery.
Our role is to support their work however we can, and to demonstrate through our actions our belief that their future is
as important as our own.
What happens next in Haiti will send a message to the world about the power of collaboration on behalf of every poor
nation that has worked hard to earn a foothold in the global economy but has tumbled in recent months.
On behalf of every man and woman in the hemisphere, from the northern expanses of Canada to the southern tip of
Argentina, who is working harder than ever with fewer resources and for smaller rewards. and the children whose
futures have been jeopardized by forces far beyond their control. let us prove our commitment to an economic recovery
that reaches not only the citizens of our individual nations but all people everywhere.

The teachers at Oak Hill Academy approach their jobs with the faith that even the most hardened juvenile
delinquents can achieve -- and the knowledge that many still won't
By Karen Houppert
Sunday, April 12, 2009; W18
The six teenage boys, incarcerated at the District's Oak Hill juvenile detention facility in Laurel file into their
classroom after lunch one late January afternoon. They are surprised to see strangers -- five women and two
men -- sitting in the chairs that the boys typically occupy.
The students find some empty seats and shrug out of their matching brown coats and mismatched scarves. They
are curious about the visitors in a lean-back, fold-your-arms, prove-it kind of way.
"I'm James Forman," begins a 40-something man. "I'm a professor at Georgetown Law School and -- "
"You related to the James Forman?" interrupts 17-year-old Carleto Bailey.
"I'm James Forman Jr."
"That your father? James Forman your dad?" Carleto demands.
"Yes, I "
"Wasn't he some big civil rights guy? NAACP? Or SNCC?"
"SNCC," Forman says, seemingly surprised that Carleto has heard of his father, who was executive secretary of
the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee for years in the 1960s before becoming active with the Black
Panthers.

"He's a good guy," Carleto continues. "You tell him that."
Forman smiles. "He passed a few years ago, but he would be happy to hear this," the professor says. He scans
the room. The Oak Hill students, all African American, are dressed identically in khaki pants and royal-blue
polo shirts. They have chosen seats on the edges of the room and, after sitting down, have pushed their chairs
back as far as possible against the wall.
Forman's Georgetown law students -- African American, Arab, Latino, Caucasian -- are in jeans and sweaters.
They lean forward, intent and maybe a little bit nervous. "I teach a class on juvenile justice at the law school,"
Forman continues. "And I thought this would be a really good way for law students to learn about juvenile
justice. There is a certain amount you can learn from reading, but you also need to see and experience things. So
I thought they would learn a lot from coming out here and hearing about your experiences."
Carleto raises an eyebrow. This is a new one.
"And the benefit for you is that they know things about the law that you don't. Ya'll have certain things you
know. They have certain things they know. It can be a learning opportunity for everybody."
Forman suggests they go around the room and share their names and an interesting fact about themselves.
Dead silence.
He smiles encouragingly. "My name is James Forman, and I helped to start this organization, See Forever, that
now runs your school," he says.
Carleto, who has been leaning back on the two rear legs of his chair, brings it down with a bang that sends his
short dreads swinging forward and his black plastic rectangular glasses sliding down his nose.
A few Georgetown students jump.
He looks out over the top of his glasses. "My name's Carleto Bailey," he says. "My interesting fact is that I'm
funny./I
He gives a wide smile of bright white teeth. The Georgetown students laugh. Oak Hill student Ashawntea
Henderson, 17, who sits next to him, rolls his eyes. But Carleto's not done: "And I'm smart."
But as it turns out, these Georgetown folks -- like his other teachers at Oak Hill Academy -- aren't going to
accept Carleto's assertion at face value. They want more than good grades, more than the right answers on a
multiple-choice test. They want him to prove that he can think.
Forman shows the group an excerpt of a film about juveniles incarcerated at New York's Rikers Island.
Afterward, the law students want to know whether a label makes a difference. It's a hard question. "Inmates?
Residents? Scholars?" one of them asks. "Does it matter what you're called?"
Carleto studies the woman's face to discern what she wants to hear back. It is blank. He struggles. "Not so
much," he says, finally. He looks at her. She seems unconvinced. He worries that he has given the wrong
answer and tries again.
"Back in the community, there are certain [police] patrols in the neighborhood who say, 'I know what you're up
to.' When we come home, some of us are trying to do right, but they basically criticize us because you're already
labeled."

"What are the labels?" Forman asks.
This one is easy for Carleto. He sinks down in his chair and throws it out.
"Trouble," he says.
***
Carleto Bailey is trouble. He is also, as he rightly noted, smart. But he has arrived at Oak Hill Academy with a
few disadvantages: He has been poorly educated in the D.C. public schools, was frequently truant and has had
multiple run-ins with the law. The D.C. Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services, which runs Oak Hill,
won't release information on the specific crime that landed Carleto here because he is still a juvenile, but we do
know this is Carleto's second time at the detention center. His academic knowledge is spotty at best. He can tell
you who James Forman is, but not where the comma falls in a letter's greeting. ("Dear, Fidel" he writes in a
mock letter to Castro during English class.) He is a fairly typical Oak Hill "scholar."
And, once upon a time, he would have been written off But today, staff at the fledgling Oak Hill Academy are
determined to view the kids' captive time here as a window of opportunity to fill in some of the gaping holes in
their education. Part of the reform initiative of Vincent Schiraldi, director of Youth Rehabilitation Services, the
school opened its doors only last year and takes a unique approach to teaching delinquent youth.
What would happen, Oak Hill Academy co-founders Forman and David Domenici wondered, if you seduced
these kids with content that was meaningful to them? What would happen if they had lots of good, caring
teachers in small classrooms? What if one assumed the kids could learn -- and behaved as such? In other words,
what would happen if the District's most challenged students got a private school education, albeit on a campus
of a decidedly different nature?
"The bottom line," says Domenici, "is that the kids most at risk need the highest quality programming, but
they've gotten the worst."
It is this conviction that drove Domenici, who is also the school's principal, and Forman to create three public
charter schools for underprivileged and troubled students in the District over the past 11 years. Called the Maya
Angelou schools, the two high schools and middle school attack educational deficiencies from all angles.
Students attend small classes taught by specially trained staff. The high school day stretches from 9 a.m. to 6
p.m., with three meals provided. Some kids, whose home lives prove too chaotic for study, are offered
supervised housing in the neighborhood. And it works. Last year, 93 percent of Maya Angelou graduates were
accepted into two- or four-year colleges, Domenici says. (According to the District's Office of the State
Superintendent of Education, 29 percent of students who enter ninth grade in D.C. public schools and city
charter schools enroll in postsecondary educational programs within 18 months of graduating high school.)
It is a good model. But even though Domenici and Forman were used to teaching court-involved youth -- about
40 percent of Maya Angelou students had spent some time at Oak Hill -- working inside the gates posed a new
set of challenges. Youth Rehabilitation Services has been under a court monitor for 23 years due in part to a
history of abuse and poor conditions. When Schiraldi took over the department in 2005 and began his reform
efforts by implementing a less punitive and more therapeutic detention model at Oak Hill, he saw immediately
that changing the school was essential. "How could I look at my staff at Oak Hill and say we are about
excellence when the kids were sitting in a school that was a total waste of time from 9 to 3 every day?"
Schiraldi says. Kids sat and watched movies all day. Little, if any teaching was going on, Schiraldi says. "It was
a miserable, miserable school."
Schiraldi immediately began lobbying the D.C. Board of Education hard to hire someone new to operate the
school, and as soon as he got the okay, he put out a request for proposals. Domenici and Forman submitted a
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760796 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760796 Date: 06/30/2015
plan that Schiraldi says "blew the other ones out of the water," and in 2007 were awarded a $12 million contract
to run the school for the next three years.
Domenici's and Forman's partnership is a somewhat unlikely one. Domenici is the son of former New Mexico
Republican senator Pete Domenici. He went to Stanford Law School, worked in corporate law for a few years
and then gave it up to teach and work with teen delinquents. Forman is the grandson of Jessica Mitford, who
was the daughter of a British baron and a celebrated civil rights activist and journalist. Forman, who graduated
from Yale Law School, worked as a law clerk for Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and as a D.C. public defender.
After seeing how few good schooling options his teenage clients had, he joined forces with Domenici, whom he
met through a mutual friend, to start an independent school for 20 students in 1997. A year later, it became part
of the first Maya Angelou public charter school.
At Oak Hill Academy, principal Domenici fights with an occasionally maddening bureaucracy for basics:
functioning boilers, permission for a college tour for a group of six students, classes uninterrupted by
corrections staff who sometimes will call three-quarters of the students out in the middle of class to take their
meds. Forman is chairman of the Maya Angelou Public Charter School Board of Directors and board member
of its parent group, the See Forever Foundation. He attacks hurdles from the other side, fundraising and
advocating for juvenile justice reform.
"When David came out to run the school here, it was like "Ocean's 12": Go find all the people you can trust
from your previous mission," Forman jokes. That included past colleagues and even a few Maya Angelou
graduates. Samantha Crandal Simpore, who had been at a then-coed Oak Hill herself when she was 15 on an
accessory assault charge, went to a Maya Angelou school and now runs the Oak Hill Academy welcome center.
"I tell them, I was here, too," Simpore says. She tells each new student about how she was 17 years old and
didn't know her multiplication tables, how she rode the bus to school each day hooked up to her Walkman,
hoping no one knew she was listening to a recitation of times tables. "I say: 'You're at an intersection in your
life. You know what's down the street behind you. Nothing you can do about that. But you have a choice about
what's up the road ahead.'"
Many of the 90 Oak Hill students, ranging in age from 14 to 19, come in performing way below grade level, and
nearly half have been diagnosed with learning disabilities. They are at Oak Hill for an average of 10 months,
cycling in and out on a schedule that has nothing to do with a nine-month academic year. Out of necessity, they
are grouped according to the cell blocks they live on to keep opposing gangs separate. Thirteen-year-olds can be
in classes with 18-year-olds. More than half have been committed to Oak Hill for violent felonies. Fights are
common. (Before the month is out, Carleto will get into a fistfight in the hallway that will delay his release
date.)
Through the use of small classes -- typically five to 14 teens work with one teacher, a teaching assistant and a
guard -- the school organizes the curriculum around four-week themes designed to pique students' curiosity and
get them to think critically about the nature of democracy, social justiCe and their role in the world. For
example, during the Relationship theme, students parse the types of relationships ranging from those between
humans and the natural world (ancient river civilizations) to those between individuals and groups (Pharaohs
and their subjects) to those between humans and ideas (liberation theology). At the same time, in English class,
students will be working on the standard five-paragraph essay via the guiding question: "Why do relationships
matter, and how can relationships be both good and bad for people?" With the current unit, Change, the D.C.
public school system's learning standards are woven into the social studies curriculum under loose headings
such as "Changes in the Way Humans Think About the World and Their Place in It," which becomes a way of
introducing the scientific revolution, the Enlightenment and the Magna Carta. It's a philosophy that emphasizes
learning through making cross-discipline connections long popular in affluent, progressive schools but typically
eschewed in schools for underprivileged kids, where rote learning and a return to such basics often rule.

Oak Hill Academy has also created a course called Advocacy, which the Georgetown law students are co-
teaching, emphasizing this month's theme. Domenici believes learning how the law works in a democracy "is
essential to teaching them to be good citizens."
"We always believed that one of our roles should be to help kids self-advocate or advocate on behalf of a
community," Domenici says. "We think this is a good skill for students individually and also one that our
democracy demands."
But this is an ambitious agenda, and Oak Hill Academy faces significant obstacles. Can you teach teens to think
critically when they're missing the basic underpinnings of education? How do you teach empowerment in a
setting that demands rigid compliance to keep kids from misbehaving?
Although he sometimes grows discouraged, Domenici does his best to buoy his staff members when they learn
that one of their most promising students got into a fight on the unit or "graduated" from the program only to
commit another crime and be sent back. "I talk to staff about the fact that, day to day, our job is to do the
absolute best work you can in the domain that is within your control," he says, reminding them that they don't
control all the pieces of the puzzle. "And if you do that well, you have done the moral and just thing."
His staff members must keep the faith while straddling what are to them two equally potent realities: First,
knowledge is power, and through possessing it, every student is capable of success. And, absent the right
support, failure lurks right around the corner. It sounds like this: "I think Carleto has a good chance of finishing
high school and going on to college," Domenici says. Pause. "Also, he is highly at risk of not doing that."
***
It is a cold day in late January, and Oak Hill is in the midst of the four-week session on change. Dressed in
jeans, a blue shirt and a gray corduroy jacket (the heat's not working), Oak Hill social studies teacher John
Adams paces around the room and then stops to bend over Carleto, who is doodling on a piece of paper at his
desk.
"Pay attention," he says, taking Carleto's pencil. "Carleto, what is today's essential question?"
"What is historical change, and how is it different from other kinds of change?" Carleto says, reading from the
board where Adams has scrawled his topic.
"Yes," Adams says. He ignores a student who is wandering around the room aimlessly, until the student
snatches a hat off a classmate and tosses it toward the hallway. A youth development specialist, which is how
corrections guards are referred to under Schiraldi, appears to be deeply engrossed in a magazine in the back of
the room. But she snatches the hat from mid-air, scowls at the disruptive student and tucks the hat in her pocket.
"Please sit," Adams tells the student.
Not quite sitting, not quite standing, the student perches on the edge of Adams's desk.
Good enough.
Adams continues: "What's the difference between personal change and historical change?"
Silence.
"Anybody?

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760796 Date: 06/30/2015
More silence.
"Ashawntea?"
"Historical change is like a revolution," Ashawntea says.
Adams throws out a list of changes -- getting a raise in salary, moving to a new house, the election of President
Obama -- and Carleto accurately sorts the changes into micro and macro, personal and historical.
"Obama's campaign was all about change," Adams says. "Do you think he is talking historical change?" He
wants the students to think about the president, who has been in office now for two days. What might his first
100 days look like? he asks the students. "What advice would you offer him?"
Carleto looks stumped.
"Just throw out some ideas," Adams prompts. He tells the students that they are going to craft their own letters
to the president, advising him on how to set his agenda for change.
Carleto slaps his pencil down on the desk. "Obama's not reading our letters," he says. He folds his arms across
his chest, skeptical that the president will lay eyes on this letter -- and skeptical, perhaps, that the teachers really
want to hear his ideas.
***
Later, Carleto will acknowledge that he knows quite a bit about the president, as he is reading Barack Obama's
"Dreams From My Father." "It started off as a good book, but it got excellent," he says. He struggles hard to
articulate the book's themes and appeal. "I don't know how to put it," he says finally, "but growing up with -- no
disrespect, but -- a Caucasian mom and an African father, he still made it through."
Sitting in a guard's room off the gym on a February evening, the echoing sound of classmates bouncing
basketballs around the cavernous gym, Carleto goes on to tell his own possibly apocryphal story.
"As a child, he was very fun, happy -- as far as kindergarten through sixth grade. Starting in first grade, he was
on the honor roll and was also making it to school every day," he says, beginning in third person, but quickly
lapsing into first. "In the late stages of middle school; at the end of eighth grade, I started smoking weed, doing
stuff I wasn't supposed to be doing."
He takes full responsibility. "No one peer-pressured me or anything. I was liking what was going on when I was
high," he explains. He, like almost all the teens at Oak Hill, denies being involved in a gang. Still, Carleto says
that his best friend since elementary school was killed in 10th grade in "a neighborhood thing." "Nowadays,
anyone can just ride up on you, and you can be mistaken for someone else and be shot," he says, explaining that
his buddy was shot because of a "miscommunication." "It wasn't intended for us," he says, insisting that he and
his friend, nicknamed "Smoke," were just waiting for the bus. Then he announces, "I don't want to talk about
it."
So he doesn't, though it clearly haunts him: He will doodle "R.I.P. Smoke" on the cover of his blue folder or on
a piece of loose-leaf paper or the comer of the chalkboard.
He's happy to talk about Oak Hill Academy though, where he has a 3.5 grade-point average after six months.
(Domenici says Carleto is in the top 25 percent of students at Oak Hill and tests fairly high on assessments.)
Carleto likes the school even though it is a bit easy for him, being a senior in with freshman. He complains that
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760796 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760796 Date: 06/30/2015
the classes are too short and that the guards are always interrupting them to move on just when the class is
getting warmed up. That really bugs him, but he doesn't say much. He says that he will be leaving Oak Hill in
two months and intends to finish his schooling at Oak Hill's transition center in the District, from which he says
he will graduate this June. When he gets out, there are a couple of things he wants to do right off, he says. First,
he intends to see his girlfriend, then go out to a restaurant and then go to "the Adidas shop in Georgetown,
where my mom will get me some stuff-- and my dad, too."
He says his mom was pretty upset when he got arrested and sent to Oak Hill. "She was. . . I'm going to say she
was kind of like surprised at my actions, what I done," Carleto says. "You know how they say 'Whatever hides
in the dark, comes out?'. . . She was not ashamed of me, but disappointed in me." Meanwhile, she makes the
long, 45-minute trek from the District to Laurel to visit. "Every weekend, both days!" he says.
He is alternately vague and specific when he describes his family life. He has four brothers -- ages 27, 23, 16
and 11 -- and reports that he and his two younger brothers live with his mom. He says his mom works as a
secretary, but he struggles to remember where. "She was working with, what's that program downtown by the
Washington Monument, dealing with Smokey the Bear?. . . I'm trying to think. It's right by the Holocaust
Museum. It's a brick building. She works there."
Later, Carleto's school case worker, Essence Jones, will offer a somewhat different account of Carleto's life.
Although Carleto is in 12th grade, he will not graduate in June as he says. He is still six credits shy, Jones says.
And it will be at least three months -- not two -- before his release.
Carleto's father is not part of his life, Jones says. The teenager had been living with his aunt before coming to
Oak Hill. His mother, who has a rap sheet dating to 1982, has been in and out of jail for years, arrested
repeatedly for a string of felonies and misdemeanors, including possession and distribution of drugs, as well as
prostitution. She has been in prison since 2005, serving three consecutive sentences totaling seven years for
assault with a dangerous weapon, attempted distribution of cocaine and violation of bail.
She is not visiting Carleto on weekends.
***
By the end of February, still in the midst of the unit on change, the Oak Hill teens file into their advocacy class,
jostling each other, edgy. It is unseasonably warm outside, and they do not want to be here. Reluctantly they
take their seats, and Carleto positions himself so that he can see the patch of brown grass and mud in the prison
yard, visible through the door someone has wedged open. Occasionally, a breeze wafts into the room.
Today, the law students decide to tackle the topic of disproportionate minority confinement. If youths of color
are 35 percent of the general population in the United States, but 62 percent of the prison population, this is
disproportionate minority confinement, the law students explain. They refer the teens to a handout each has on
the desk in front of him, an article excerpt from New American Media, "Racism of the Juvenile Justice System
Revealed," to explain that this isn't simply because people of color commit more crimes: "African-American
youths are 4.5 times more likely, and Latinos 2.3 times more likely, than white youths to be detained for
identical offenses. About half of white teenagers arrested on a drug charge go home without being formally
charged and drawn into the system. Only one-quarter of black teens arrested on drug charges catch a similar
break."
Although youth of color are 100 percent of Oak Hill's population of inmates and, indeed, 100 percent of all 721
juvenile delinquents currently committed to Youth Rehabilitation Services care in settings across the city,
disproportionate minority confinement is a hard concept for the teens to grasp. Georgetown student Abby Fee
tries a pie graph, a bar graph, a sketch of disproportionate Xs and Os. Blank stares.

Then it slowly dawns on Ashawntea what they're talking about. "Hey," he says, suddenly sitting forward.
"They're switched around! Basically, there's more of us juveniles in prison than white juveniles -- even though
there's more of them."
"Yes," Fee says. "So the population outside the system looks a lot different from that inside the system."
Ashavvntea sits back in his chair to mull this over.
Fee and the other law students move the teens from the statistics to a speculative discussion about the reasons
behind these figures. They have prepared a role-playing game to coax the teens into thinking about this from
different perspectives. Then, they want the students to practice advocating for change. "So, we're going to have
three roles," Fee says, dividing the teens into pairs. "One group is a 15-year-old; one group is playing a math
teacher; and one group is playing a city council member."
Carleto and his partner learn that they are to play a city council member who is preparing a presentation on
reforming the police department. Carleto doesn't want to be a city council member. He doesn't even want to be
here today. He wraps and unwraps his pencil in the bottom of his T-shirt. He puts his glasses on, then takes
them off.
"How could you maintain better relationships" with police? Fee asks, settling herself into a chair to help Carleto
and his partner work through this.
Carleto throws his pencil down on the table. Won't answer. She asks again. Silence. Finally, he offers a sullen
challenge. "Stop harassing people for no reason?"
"How do you want them to treat people?"
"Equally," he says. He picks up the pencil and tap, tat, taps it on the desk. Fee tries to get him to be more
specific.
"Don't arrest for small problems. Instead, take them home, and tell your family what you're doing," Carleto's
partner says, unconsciously slipping into second person.
"And how do you think they can help crime be stopped or decreased in general?" Fee prods.
A long pause. Could be their minds are whirring busily; could be they're spacing out. Fee, a teacher before
enrolling at Georgetown, takes it in stride. She taps the paper a couple of times and repeats the question.
"Don't have 10 or 15 cars patrolling and then have an area where you barely see a police car," Carleto says.
"Patrol each ward equally?" asks Fee.
Carleto writes that down, then adds: "I see a lot of cruel things they done that ain't right." Fee nods, encourages
him to write it down.
Carleto's partner grabs the pencil and speaks as he writes. "The majority of police shouldn't carry guns. I could
say, 'The majority of police are racist.'"
"But how would you fix that?" Fee. prods.

"A camera on their car to catch them if they're doing it -- but a secret one," Carleto suggests. He sits up
straighter in his chair. "And don't just pull over people because they're black. They can say anything, that's the
reason why I pulled you over, because your headlights are off or whatever." Suddenly, Carleto is on a roll, and
he rattles off a list of improvements.
"Call to order of the city council," says Georgetown student Dania Ayoubi.
Carleto and his partner stand in the front of the class. "Hello, I'm Mr. Jones, and I am a city councilman,"
Carleto says, glancing down at his paper and twisting the tail of his shirt with his free hand. "We have some
complaints from the different communities and wards about police, and these are some of our suggestions about
cracking down on officers." He sounds nervous as he begins the list. "Stop harassing minorities and other ethnic
youths, and treat them equal to the same race that you are. Also, police don't arrest if there is a situation at the
school like a fight or anything. I feel they should not be arrested but taken home. Then tell their parents why
this happened and what the reason was for being stopped by the police." He moves briskly through the
suggestions and twice, tentatively, tries actually making eye contact with the audience. In conclusion, he says,
"verbally abusing" youth won't be tolerated any more. "Basically, we want to crack down on the officers and
have them removed, if so."
Another pair of students rises to begin a presentation, but the teens are interrupted by the crackle of a guard's
walkie-talkie. "Time to go!" the guard announces.
The law students are surprised -- they are not quite done -- but politely acquiesce.
"Wait!" Ashawntea says, standing up. "We got 10 more minutes."
"It will take you five minutes to get your stuff together and get your coats on," the guard says.
"But we have 10 minutes!" Carleto insists. He and Ashawntea sit back down and fold their arms. "It's only 2:20.
We got 10 more minutes still."
The guard takes a beat, then shrugs and concedes Carleto's point. He goes back out into the hall to wait.
Carleto shoots Ashawntea a look of surprise. His advocacy worked.
"Yesss!" Ashawntea hisses under his breath.

of Forensic Examiners; I have guest lectured and taught industrial security management, homeland
security, port and harbor security and critical incident response management.
As elated as everyone is over the splendid outcome of the Maersk Alabama hijacking case, as I had
predicted, in today's news, it is reported that four additional vessels were attacked and now Terrorists
are holding some 60 hostages. Before anyone, does anything regarding Somalia, may I make the
following comments and observations.
What is going on in the Gulf of Aden is as an organized criminal enterprise for profit. There are some
250 hostages being held and they are being kept as well as they can be under the circumstances because
the terrorists are expecting a payday out of this. As soon as they see any form of direct Military action in
the northeast at the mouth of the Gulf of Aden, I can assure you more Americans will be abducted, and
we will see another series of video beheadings under a Democratic watch.
I would recommend that the Secretary encourage the United Nations to create an International Maritime
Security Working Group. Since the Shipping Industry has already absorbed something like Fifty Billion
Dollars regarding the various piracy incidents in 2008 alone; they have the resources to contract private
security/military contractors who could work onboard merchant shipping in International Waters.

They could rotate from the northern edge of the threat envelope to the southern end and take direct
action on a case-by-case basis. Through this endeavor, as these targets of opportunity begin to dry up, so
will the piracy activity that the World community has pacified by the payment of extortion money.
Thank you in advance for your anticipated interest, and cooperation in this matter.

Source of the rumor I mentioned this a.m. — FP
Not sure if people have seen this item from Foreign Policy magazine:
Names: State, Mexico
Fri, 04/10/2009 - 5:56pm
Washington foreign policy hands in and out of the administration say that Maria Otero is likely to be
nominated to be under secretary of state for democracy and global affairs, or "G". The Bolivian-born Otero is
president and CEO of Accion International and a member of the board of the Clinton Global Initiative, and is an
expert on sustainable microfinance with an interest in global women's issues, a key interest of Secretary
Clinton.
Former State Department counselor Wendy Sherman is being discussed for high level posts. Among them, the
Asia expert, Albright Group principal, and close Hillary Clinton advisor is being discussed as a candidate for
under secretary of state for economic affairs, now that Lael Brainard has gone to the Treasury Department, and
as a possible nominee to be uS, ambassador to China. (Update: and USAID administrator.)
Former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Carlos Pascual has been reported likely to be nominated to be Obama's
ambassador to Mexico. While some reports have suggested that Pascual, now vice president and director of
foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institution, authored a paper describing Mexico as a failed state;think
tank hands noted that Pascual was not the author of a report produced last year by Brookings on weak and failed
states. (The study that seems to be in question, Index of State Weakness in the Developing World, rates Mexico
in the top quintile of developing countries, the 120th weakest out of 141, e.g. among the strongest, and was Co-
directed by Susan Rice, now U.S. ambassador to the UN). Pascual alluded to the issue in a conversation with
Brookings staff yesterday. Pascual was the first coordinator for reconstruction and stabilization at the State
Department. (A call to his office was directed to the communications office, which declined to comment on his
status.)

Subject: Dead Aid
Cheryl,
I know the book Dead Aid well. The ideas are not new. They are essentially the same ones that Bill Easterly
has proposed in his two books: The Elusive Quest for Growth and White Man's Burden. The essential
argument is that a top-down, "big-plan" approach to foreign assistance — the Jeff Sachs' approach - has not
worked in the past and will not work in the future.
Both Easterly and Moyo argue for a bottom-up approach that supports overall economic growth. They
emphasize expanding access to capital markets and low-cost financing, promoting better governance and

entrepreneurs.
I will give Nora a couple of articles for you to take home and look at. One of them, by Paul Collier, offers a
strong alternative to the USAID approach of funding small holder farmers. The other is by Dambisa Moyo and

The OSCE's broad geographical coverage and the span of issues ranging from technical arms control treaties to foreign
policy and human rights challenges in the Balkans, Eastern Europe, Russia, Caucasus and Central Asia requires in-depth
knowledge of all aspects of American foreign policy, plus an ability to respond to rapidly changing circumstances during
open mutlilateral debates and in negotiations on international agreement and treaties. It also requires rapid intervention in
emerging crisis situations, such as potential regional conflict flashpoints in the Caucasus, Central Asia or the
Balkans. The PermRep to the OSCE is also responsible for overseeing OSCE operations in 18 countries of Europe and
Central Asia, while overseeing a staff of 30 professionals in Vienna and an additional 50 Americans seconded to OSCE
Missions and field offices spread from Tirana to Tashkent. The briefing memo endorsed by Secretary Clinton on
"Revitalizing the OSCE" noted the importance of assigning a strong Ambassador to this key position -- a need that is only
heightened as it appears the Organization is about to embark on a multi-year major strategic review and negotiation of
principles and mechanisms to underpin European security architecture. Thus, the Ambassador to the U.S. Mission to the
OSCE will also have to be very sensitive to negotiations and trends elsewhere in Europe, including in a bilateral US-
Russian track, in NATO, and in US-EU relations, as well as overseeing negotiations to revive conventional arms control in
the European theater. In-depth knowledge of the former Soviet Union region and Russian language skills are a major
plus for the Permanent Representative, as this is a primary forum for interaction with Russia and Central Asian countries
on a daily basis. Strong public speaking skills are also a must, as the U.S. Ambassador to the OSCE is expected to
speak on the record in hundreds of public statements each year on issues of concern to two different regional bureaus
(EUR and SCA) and four functional bureaus (VCI, DRL, EB, and RPM).

HRC called me understandably upset with the section of this NYT story regarding General Jones:
http:fiwww.nvtimes.com/2009/05/02/world/02clinton.html? r=1&hpw=&pagewanted=orint
She made it clear that this in no way reflects her feelings or anything she thinks about him, let alone anyone "in her
circle" would say. She wanted me to make that clear to the reporter. I just spoke to Mark Landler, told him on the
record (which I reiterated below via email) that Secretary Clinton holds General Jones in the highest regard, she has
nothing but the highest praise for him, and that I was more than happy to put her on the phone to make herself clear on
this point — since they did not speak about their relationship during her lengthy interview for the story. I especially
made the point that identifying this person as someone "in her circle" was incredibly misleading. Someone in her circle
is someone like you, or a Jake, or me. And none of us would ever say anything like that. Someone who was slated for
a position at State irrespective of the choice of HRC as Secretary should not be allowed to be identified that way. Mark
conceded that point and let me know he will be changing the sourcing to read, "But State Department officials, and
others in the administration..." It's a small consolation, but I think a very important one.

CEO's, Foundation presidents, and other prominent individuals on a range of isues, and they'll need to know that, the

There is some good space on the 7th floor (suite 7427 has been vacated by the CFO and would be perfect), and there
might also be extra space in the newly renovated old wing, where Judith McHale and R will be moving. In any event, I

Berlusconi had asked that each donor country "adopt" a damaged cultural heritage monument, but EUR seems to think
that the Italians would welcome the U.S. initiative which might include help in repairing physical damage to the
University itself but would concentrate primarily on development of human capital. One of Ambassador Bagley's
suggestions was that we work with the Italian Ambassador here, who is well connected to the Prime Minister, to ensure
a positive Italian response.

conjunction with the National Italian American Foundation (NIAF) that would focus largely on raising money for
academic exchanges for students from L'Aquila University, the school of higher education most affected by the
earthquake. This is not exactly the monument rebuilding that PM Berlusconi initially proposed, but it is something very
much in keeping with our mission and of interest to NIAF. Ambassador Bagley and Kris had a number of suggestions that

Iraqi Gays Face Gruesome Torture/ Murder

GAY CITY NEWS, 04/30/2009
http://gavcitynews.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=20307475&BRD=2729&PAG=461&dept id=569346&rfi=6
As the murder campaign targeting Iraqi gays intensifies, a leading Arabic television network last week revealed the use of
a horrifying new form of lethal torture against Iraqi gay men - anti-gay Shiite death squads are sealing their anuses with a
powerful glue, then inducing diarrhea, which leads to a painful and agonizing death. The use of this stomach-turning new
torture was first reported by the Al Arabiya network, which is headquartered in the United Arab Emirates and was alerted
to the story by a leading Iraqi feminist and human rights activist.
Yanar Mohammed, president of the Organization of Women's Freedom in Iraq (OWFI), told Al Arabiya that the torture
substance "is an Iranian-manufactured glue that, if applied to the skin, sticks to it and can only be removed by surgery.
After they glue the anuses of homosexuals, they give them a drink that causes diarrhea. Since the anus is closed, the
diarrhea causes death. Videos of this form of torture are being distributed on mobile telephones in Iraq."
Al Arabiya said its reporter confirmed the use of this anal torture by "visiting the Baghdad morgue in Bab-al-Moazaam in
central Baghdad, where Neman Mohsen, the medical examiner, confirmed they have the bodies of seven homosexuals
in the morgue. He said, 'We were not able to identify the culprits, who dumped the bodies in front of the morgue and fled
without being seen." A two-person team from Human Rights Watch (HRW) currently in Iraq to investigate persecution of
LGBT people has also confirmed the use of this form of torture. In a widely-circulated email from Iraq, the head of HRW's
LGBT desk, Scott Long, said he and his colleague had gathered evidence which confirms the Al Arabiya report and that
HRW would make its own detailed report after the organization's two staffers return to the United States next week.
OWFI's Mohammed, the woman responsible for gathering information about the use of this sadistic anal torture and
passing it on to Al Arabiya, told Gay City News that "the story was so horrific that when I first heard it from gay friends I
didn't believe it. But then I investigated and found it was really true that the anuses of gay men were being glued shut."
Speaking by telephone from Toronto, where she was on a brief visit to relatives before a scheduled return to Iraq next
week, Mohammed told this reporter that, "Fortunately, Al Arabiya has a very good human rights reporter, to whom I told
what I had found, and he was able to confirm it by visiting the morgue."
She said that "many older women in my organization.were quite opposed to taking up the question of the persecution of
homosexuals and didn't understand why it was important. But I firmly believe that misogyny and homophobia are two
sides of the same coin, and that we had a duty to speak out against the persecution of gays in Iraq, which is so little

known that I was surprised by the extent of it when I began to look into it."
Mohammed, 49, is well known for her courageous human rights work. She co-founded OWFI in Baghdad in June 2003 in
the wake of the U.S. invasion and occupation, and the organization has led campaigns against so-called honor killings,
the abduction of women, and trafficking in women and children. She also co-founded Iraq's first feminist newspaper, Al
Mousawat (Equality), which has been published quarterly for the last three years. Trained as an architect, Mohammed told
Gay City News she has abandoned that profession to work full time for OWFI. She has received numerous awards for her
work for women's rights and human rights, including the Eleanor Roosevelt Global Rights Award given by the US Feminist
Majority Foundation.
Ali Hili, the 33-year-old gay Iraqi exile who coordinates the association Iraqi LGBT, which is headquartered in London but
has members and informants throughout Iraq, told Gay City News that he has also been able to confirm the use of lethal
anal torture. "We have had reports, increasingly over the last four or five days, about the use of this technique not just in
Baghdad but in smaller town and cities all over Iraq," Hili said by telephone. "We have reports on seven young men who
have been through this horrible experience in which they were arrested in the south of Iraq and had their anuses sealed,
or 'locked' as the torturers say. Our sources told us that hospitals all over Iraq's southern region have received so many
cases of similar incidents where men have had their anuses glued, but that what makes the situation even worse and
more lethal is that they have been refused treatment in hospitals when they sought it because of homophobia."
As of this week, Hili and Iraqi LGBT have documented 617 cases of assassinations of LGBT people since a death-to-all-
gays fatwa was issued by Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the spiritual leader of all Shiite muslims in Iraq, in 2005. The
murder campaign of "sexual cleansing" of homosexuals has intensified in recent months, with 70 new killings since
December alone (see this reporter's April 16-29 article, "Iraqi Gay Murders Surge; World Finally Takes Note").
Now, Hili says, "I have just received word of seven new murders of gays in one week, last week." He provided Gay City
News with the names and towns of origin of the most recent victims of the anti-gay-death squads. They are Abbas Mosa,
33, from Al Hay; Saeed Majeed, 27, from Al Samawa; Jabar Khothayer, 19, from Al Dewaniya; Majed Alawi, 41, from Al
Hindiya; Hazim Hussein, age unknown, from Al Najaf; Mohammed Qasim, 25, from Al Dewaniya; and Rama Sabri, 19,
from Al Mohanawiya.
At the same time, the Iraqi news website niqash.org reported last week that "AI-Baghdadiya, a satellite television channel
based in Cairo... broadcast a report on April 7 saying that 20 young men accused of homosexuality were taken to Ibn al-
Nafis hospital in Baghdad with mutilated genitals."
Hili told Gay City News that much of the most recent wave of assassinations appears to be the work of the Mahdi Army,
the militia led by fundamentalist Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. He said that one of Iraqi LGBT's informants "is connected
to high-ranking religious within the Mahdi Army, and he has been told of a campaign to target anyone who is suspected of
being gay." Increasingly, Hili said, leaflets and "Wanted" posters are appearing with lists of men targeted to be killed for
what are called "crimes against morality," meaning homosexuality. A list of Iraqi LGBT members to be eliminated is also
circulating, Hili said, and he's been told his own name is at the top of this list.
Hili also said that pharmacists have been reporting to the police about male customers who were regularly buying female
hormones and cosmetic creams. In one such recent instance, two of these supposed transgendered men were arrested
and taken to an unknown location, and have not been heard from since.

Subject: For the Secretary of State visit to Haiti
I enjoyed the opportunity to discuss the emerging potential that Haiti presents with the Secretary
of State and former President Clinton last night. I would like to take this opportunity to make a
brief suggestion for Thursday's trip to Haiti:
We discussed the catalytic role the United States could play in leveraging much needed private
investment in large scale job creation, for example through direct involvement of OPIC. In my
report I pointed out that the port in Port-au-Prince is the most expensive port in the Caribbean
and recommended the opening of new private ports. Ports remain a critical bottleneck to a job
creation strategy both in garment manufacturing and agriculture. They also play a pivotal role in
ensuring that some of the complementary imports necessary for the proposed road construction
projects can enter the country both in the required quantities and in a cost-effective and timely
manner. Elsewhere I have argued that spiraling prices in construction booms often mean that
available funds only go half way to the finishing line.
The Haitian authorities have already made inroads in addressing some of these inefficiencies and
stand ready to do more. In fact, Prime Minister Pierre-Louis noted in the letter to investors which
was presented at the meeting with Charles Rangel and garment entrepreneurs on Monday, that
"ISPS certification of port facilities and alleviation of customs procedures" are in progress. The
meetings tomorrow may present an opportunity to emphasize once again how central well-
functioning, competitive ports are to attract foreign investors as part of the HOPEII window and
to put the right transport infrastructure in place.

Obama is morphing into old rival Clinton
By: Alex Conant
May 6, 2009
Politico
A year ago today, Barack Obama won the North Carolina and Indiana primaries, leading the late Tim Russert to famously
declare, "We now know who the Democratic nominee will be, and nobody is going to dispute it."
Russert was right, but Hillary Clinton, nevertheless, kept campaigning for several more weeks, fueled by her supporters'
convictions that her proposals were better than Obama's.
After barely 100 days in office, it now appears Obama agrees: Since taking office, he has dropped virtually every position
that distinguished him from Clinton.
Granted, there were not many policy differences between Obama and Clinton during the campaign. But those that existed
were sharply debated and helped Obama define himself as the pragmatic change agent that many voters now believe him
to be.
Take Iraq. Obama never missed an opportunity on the campaign trail to remind Democrats that he was the sole candidate
to oppose the war in 2002, and — unlike Clinton — he had a hard date for ending the war. Clinton repeatedly questioned
the wisdom and sincerity of Obama's pledge to remove all combat troops from Iraq within 16 months of taking office. It
was the biggest difference between the two candidates — and one of the top reasons Obama won the nomination.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761287 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761287 Date: 06/30/2015
Yet just weeks after entering office, Obama largely dropped his campaign plan. Rather than withdraw all combat troops on
a set timeline, Obama opted for a conditions-based withdrawal that will leave as many as 50,000 troops in the war zone at
the end of 2011 — exactly the sort of drawdown he maligned Clinton for proposing.
Health care is another example. While Obama was outflanking Clinton on the left on Iraq, she made up for it by criticizing •
his health care plan as inadequate. Both candidates claimed to support universal health care, but only Clinton's plan
included a government mandate that would force all Americans to have health insurance.
Primary voters will recall Clinton and Obama endlessly debating this, with Clinton accusing Obama of leaving about 15
million people without health care and Obama warning voters that Clinton's plan would require "harsh, stiff penalties on
those who don't purchase it."
Just as with Iraq, Obama is now moving toward Clinton's position. His budget outline proposes a health care plan that
"must put the United States on a clear path to cover all Americans." That strongly suggests a mandate, since any
volunteer system would see some opting out. As Ezra Klein reported in The American Prospect when the administration's
health care plan began to leak out, "Despite the controversy over the individual mandate in the campaign, [Obama's team]
will support it."
Some of the most significant differences between Clinton and Obama focused on governing. One of Obama's first
breakthrough moments was at the YearlyKos convention in August 2007, when Clinton defended her relationships with
lobbyists, saying "a lot of those lobbyists, whether you like it not, represent real Americans." Drawing a sharp contrast,
Obama promised to ban anyone who had recently worked as a lobbyist from serving in his administration.
But that promise was broken even before he took office, when the president-elect chose several lobbyists for high-level
posts, including deputy secretaries at the Defense and Health and Human Services departments. (Ironically, Obama even
nominated a lobbyist to be an assistant secretary of state under Clinton.)
Obama's campaign also made Clinton's partisanship an issue. In a thinly veiled reference to Clinton's poor standing
among Republicans, his stump speech included overt pleas for Republican support. Presenting himself as a post-partisan
leader, he promised to forge a new era of bipartisanship in Washington.
As Obama confessed at his prime-time press conference last week, he's fallen short on that front, too. Since taking office,
the president's agenda has been demonstrably partisan; nearly every bill he has so far signed into law passed Congress
on a party-line vote. If Clinton were sitting in the Oval Office instead of Obama, it's hard to imagine how Washington would
be any more partisan.
Clinton lost the battle for the Democratic nomination, but a year later, it appears her campaign has won the war of ideas
within the Democratic Party.

Crisis Hot Spots
Monday, May 18, 2009
1500 EDT
SRI LANKA: RAJAPAKSA TO DECLARE VICTORY, IDP NEEDS GROW
(SBU) The government and NGOs are struggling to respond to the needs of 60-80,000 civilians who fled the
conflict zone since May 15 and are still arriving at IDP camps. Shelter, water, basic health care, and sanitation
are the most urgent needs among the 280,000 civilians now in overcrowded camps. UNSYG Ban will travel to
Sri Lanka May 22. The EU pushed for an independent investigation into alleged human rights violations in the
war, mainly over reported civilian deaths. Czech FM Kohout said the inquiry should be carried out by Sri
Lankan authorities, but could involve non-government and UN bodies. (Colombo 539, Reuters)
SOMALIA: ISLAMISTS CAPTURE PRESIDENT'S HOMETOWN
(SBU) Al-Shabaab seized the key town of Jowhar north of Mogadishu as pro-government militia deserted their
positions near the capital, media report. The government has lost control of most of south and central Somalia;
press report insurgents are heading toward the border town of Beledweyn near Ethiopia. The Transitional
Federal Government (TFG) requested support from other armed factions in the fight against al-
Shabaab. Embassy Nairobi comments the TFG plans to lobby Ethiopia for support at a May 20 regional
ministerial meeting. (Nairobi 1010, Reuters)
MALAWI: MAY 19 ELECTIONS TOO CLOSE TO CALL
(SBU) Parties are skeptical of the integrity of the electoral process, although the U.S. embassy and international
partners will deploy observers, Embassy Lilongwe reports. (Lilongwe 257)
PAPUA NEW GUINEA: VIOLENCE TARGETS ASIAN BUSINESSES
(SBU) Attacks against ethnic Chinese-owned businesses have spread throughout the country since May 12,
with some localities reporting thousands of rioters, according to Embassy Port Moresby. Post adds the violence
demonstrates growing resentment of ethnic Chinese economic influence. The disturbances caught authorities
by surprise, and the government has not yet taken action against those involved, according to the Papua New
Guinea desk. The embassy comments the racial basis of the attacks is a new phenomenon in the country, where
the tribal fragmentation of society has kept such nationalist violence from occurring previously. (Ops/Papua
New Guinea desk telcon, Port Moresby 88, 87)

Cheryl,
Thanks again for your efforts in sorting out Bob Einhorn's position. He is doing excellent work on Iran, and will be a big
asset on Pakistan nuclear issues too.
I called Ellen this afternoon to brief her on the Lavrov talks, and she mentioned that Bob has kept in close touch with her
on his Iran work. It will be great to have her here.
Have a good weekend.

FYI. Berman just spoke about it.
•Enact two items sought by the Foreign Service: elimination of a rule that inadvertently reduces the pay of officers
serving overseas by as much as 20 percent, and extension to same-sex partners of the benefits given to spouses and
their families, such as access to U.S. health care and moving expenses. This last provision is likely to provoke GOP

LAWMAKER EXPECTS CLINTON TO SOON FIX GAY INEQUITIES AT STATE DEPT.
On Monday I posted that Rep. Howard Berman had introduced the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2010
and 2011 (H.R. 2410) late last week, which covers a broad range of foreign policy and diplomacy issues, one of which is to
"end the long-standing practice of excluding the committed partners of Foreign Service officers from the benefits routinely
provided to the spouses and children of officers serving abroad."
q12-oday, news of developments in that area: "Berman, in a hearing on funding for the Foreign Service, said he would drop •
his legislative bid as 'it is my expectation, based on very recent conversations, that the Secretary of State will move forward
with implementing all of the benefits provided in that provision in the very near future.' The congressman invited to the
hearing Michael Guest, the former US ambassador to Romania who in 2007 left the Foreign Service, citing unfair treatment of
his partner."
In February, Rep. Tammy Baldwin sent a letter co-signed by Senators Russ Feingold and Ron Wyden, and Rep. Ileana Ros-
Lehtinen to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton asking that inequities be remedied. Clinton said that such remedies were "on a
fast timeline."

Obama envoy: Time to act on climate change By ARTHUR MAX –2 hours ago
BONN, Germany (AP) — Once booed at international climate talks, the United States won sustained applause Sunday
when President Barack Obama's envoy pledged to "make up for lost time" in reaching a global agreement on climate
change.
Todd Stern also praised efforts by countries like China to reign in their carbon emissions, but said global warming
"requires a global response" and that rapidly developing economies like China "must join together" with the industrial
world to solve the problem.
The debut of Obama's climate change team was widely anticipated after eight years of obdurate participation in U.N.
climate talks by the previous Bush administration.
"We are very glad to be back. We want to make up for lost time, and we are seized with the urgency of the task before
us," Stern said to loud applause from the 2,600 delegates to the U.N. negotiations.
They clapped again when Stern said the U.S. recognized "our unique responsibility ... as the largest historic emitter of
greenhouse gases," which has created a problem threatening the entire world.
The two-week meeting by 175 countries that began Sunday was the latest stage of talks aimed at forging a climate
change agreement to replace the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on emissions targets for rich countries, which expires in 2012.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761448 Date: 06/30/2015
The United States was instrumental in negotiating Kyoto, but failed to win support at home. When George W. Bush took
office, he renounced it, calling Kyoto a flawed agreement that would harm the U.S. economy and unfair because it
demanded nothing from countries like China or India.
Stern said his team did not want a repeat of the Kyoto debacle. The latest agreement is due to be finalized in December
in Copenhagen, Denmark.
"Ultimately, this is a political process," he said. "The way forward is steered by science and pragmatism."
Stern said no one on his team doubted that climate change is real. "The science is clear, the threat is real, the facts on
the ground are outstripping the worst-case scenarios. The cost of inaction or inadequate action are unacceptable," he
said — a total change of tone from his predecessors.
Scientists warned recently that climate change is happening more rapidly that previously calculated and said the Earth
could be in danger of major climatic changes that would trigger widespread social disruption. U.N. scientists say rising
sea levels caused by global warming threatens to swamp coastlines and entire island states, and predicted increasing
drought for arid countries, especially in Africa.
Obama has set aside $80 billion in his economic stimulus package for green energy, promised $150 billion for research
over 10 years, and was tightening regulations on auto emissions, Stern said.
"America itself cannot provide the solution, but there is no solution without America," he said.
"It sent chills up my spine seeing the U.S. applauded," Keya Chatterjee of the Worldwide Fund for Nature said after
Stern's speech.
It was only 15 months ago at Bali, Indonesia, that U.S. negotiators were booed when they threatened to veto an accord
laying down a two-year negotiating process to replace Kyoto. They backed off when the delegate from Papua New
Guinea, Kevin Conrad, told them if "you are not willing to lead ... please get out of the way."
Stern urged delegates Sunday to adopt a long-range vision for reducing climate change, rather than to focus on "a series
of short-term, stopgap measures," and repeated Obama's determination to cut emissions by 80 percent by mid-century.
His speech was meant to shift the debate from persistent demands by developing countries for industrial nations to
reduce emissions by 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. Stern has said previously that goal was unattainable for
the U.S.
Speaking earlier to reporters, Stern defended the U.S. administration's goal of reducing U.S. carbon emissions by roughly
16 percent over the next dozen years from current levels.
"We don't think (the target) is low at all," he said, adding it was "consistent with what other countries are willing to do."
Others disagreed.
"The target that the United States has put forward is not going to be sufficient," said Chatterjee.
Jake Schmidt of the Nature Resources Defense Council said the Obama administration was talking behind the scenes
about setting an annual emissions reduction target leading up to 2050.
"It's hard to turn a big ship around, but it would show we are serious about our commitments to cut emissions from the
medium to the long term," Schmidt said.

With time running out before the pact is due to be completed in December, delegates are trying to narrow vast
differences over how best to fight climate change.
Issues include how much countries need to reduce emissions, how to raise the tens of billions of dollars needed annually
to fight global warming and how to transfer money and technology to poor countries who are most vulnerable to
increasingly fierce storms, droughts and failing crops.
Stern said the U.S. position will be guided by whatever deal Obama can strike with Congress.
"I do not think that it is realistic to believe that we will then be able to go into an international setting and get a higher
number than that," he said.

US to push for UN climate deal but no "magic wand"
Sun Mar 29, 2009 11:04am EDT
* Obama to push for new climate treaty
* Climate envoy says no magic wand, sets limits to U.S. cuts
(Adds details, quotes)
By Alister Doyle, Environment Correspondent
BONN, Germany, March 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama's administration promised to push for a new global
treaty to fight global warming at United Nations climate talks on Sunday but cautioned it had no magic wand.
"The United States is going to be powerfully and fully engaged," U.S. special envoy for climate change Todd Stern said at
the opening of 175-nation U.N. talks in Bonn.
"But we are all going to have to do this together, we don't have a magic wand," he told a news conference at the March
29-April 8 meeting in Bonn, the first since Obama took office. The U.S. delegation was greeted by applause at the
opening.
Stern said the United States wanted to work for a treaty that was economically "doable" and that countries could not
expect Washington to "ride in on a white horse" to solve the problem. "We can't," he said.
Some nations, racked by recession, have been waiting to hear Obama's policies before unveiling their own. The Bonn
talks are due to consider issues including the levels of greenhouse gas cuts needed to slow global warming.
Obama has promised to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by about 16-17 percent from current levels to take them
back to 1990 levels by 2020 as part of a new U.N. climate deal meant to be agreed in Copenhagen in December.
Under former President George W. Bush, the United States was isolated among industrialised nations in opposing caps
on emissions under the U.N.'s existing Kyoto Protocol. Delegates even booed U.S. delegates at a meeting in Indonesia, in
2007.

"Everyone is very excited" by signs of a stronger U.S. commitment, Yvo de Boer, head of the U.N. Climate Change
Secretariat, told a news conference. China and the United States are the top greenhouse gas emitters.
NO WHITE HORSE
Stern said, however, that the United States could not make the deepest cuts in greenhouse gases advised by the U.N.
Climate Panel for 2020 to avoid the worst of global warming, of between 25 and 40 percent below 1990 levels.
"We should be guided by a combination of science and Pragmatism," Stern said. Many developing nations, led by China,
want rich nations to make deep cuts.
Almost no developed nations have laid out goals within the 25-40 percent range. Among the most ambitious, the
European Union plans cuts of 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020.
The U.N. Climate Panel projects more floods, droughts, more powerful storms, heatwaves and rising sea levels from a
gradual build-up of heat-trapping gases from burning fossil fuels.
De Boer has in the past called Obama's goals an "opening offer" that he hopes will be toughened in Copenhagen.
Stern said that it was unclear whether Congress will manage to pass climate legislation before the Copenhagen meeting
in December. If a law is passed by then, he said, it would be unrealistic for Washington to sign up to any tougher cuts.
On Saturday, an estimated one billion people turned out the lights for an Earth Hour to show concern about global
warming. The action also dimmed landmarks from the Eiffel Tower to the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
"Earth hour was probably the largest public demonstration on climate change ever," de Boer said.

FYI:
I have now seriously reviewed 9 candidates (and explored a handful of others who, for various reasons, I didn't feel
would be what we were looking for). Two have acceted other jobs that were already on the table before I spoke to
them (and for which they were better suited). One ( who I love) has decided her legal future requires her to come
here in a capacity other than speechwriting, and I think she's right about that
None of these candidates is over 32 years old. The best writer among them is the youngest — 24. She is intellectually
extremely mature and the only professional writer in the group.
On the other hand,
she's extremely smart and an excellent writer.
I have two more candidates who are working on second rounds of mock speeches. I need to see how quickly and
effectively they grasp directions and feedback. Hopefully one of them will work out for us.
One other prospect materialized yesterday; am waiting to get a better feel for her suitability. I'm also re-mining
journalistic contacts to see if I can possibly find a more seasoned writer from a newspaper or magazine who wants to
make the switch to government. So far that has proven futile; the few journalists who I've reached out to were not
interested in coming.
Will keep you posted.

appears to be no first person Twittering in Secretary's Clinton's name.

Subject: Some other thoughts
AMS did not like any of this both for the substance and because she did not write it so we did not share it with you
today. Then I decided to share it with you anyway for any value it has for you.
Frame:
The world we live in today is inextricably interconnected. Together we succeed. Apart we fail. In the Obama
Administration, we will use smart power to advance to our shared security, shared prosperity and shared humanity.
In advancing our shared security, we seek to:
• Reduce threat of violent extremism
• Reduce the spread of weapons of mass destruction
In advancing our shared prosperity, we seek to:
• Use development to create and sustain strong stable economies by:
o Focusing on women as essential for driving economic growth;
o Expanding access to food and the means to grow or buy it; and,
o Expanding access to quality education in developing countries;
• Expand access to stable, affordable and increasingly clean energy sources
In advancing our shared humanity, we seek to:
• Expand human rights and the conditions that promote respect for human rights
• Support the development of health systems that support healthier societies and
confront the spread of pandemic disease (e.g., AlDs)
How we achieve these goals:
We will advance these goals through shared responsibility and the application of smart power. America has the
responsibility to lead, but can only lead in partnership with others. Smart power means elevating and
integrating diplomacy and development.
DIPLOMACY:
Focus on priority partnerships:
• Revitalized partnerships with historic allies EU, Japan, Korea, Australia;
• Calibrated partnerships with China and Russia;

• Cultivated partnerships: Brazil, India, Turkey, Indonesia, and South Africa;
• Targeted public/private and multilateral partnerships based upon the principles of
variable geometry (Le., focused on the problem at hand).
Build strong partnerships by:
• listening and mutual respect — which has begun already and will continue
• being accountable for the challenges we create and demanding that our partners are
similarly accountable;
• focusing on government to people, and people to people connections using new
technology to create buy in from bottom up so shared responsibility is experienced
on the ground and sustainable;
• eliminating the obstacles to cooperation that stand in the way of us achieve our
goals (e.g., resolving Cyprus so Turkey can enter the EU; engaging Iran to create
greater accountability among EU partners if engagement fails)
• creating work plans to drive cooperation on our shared agenda: tasks, timetables
and benchmarks for each country
DEVELOPMENT:
Establish and implement against our critical priorities:
• Women as economic drivers and social stabilizers;
• Education as the gateway to economic opportunity and human rights;
• Food and agriculture as the cornerstone of sustainable local economies
• Global health as the foundation for the future
Reform our government institutions
• Improve coordination in planning and budgeting across our diplomacy and
development
• Make Ambassadors country-level CEOs responsible for government-wide
efforts in each country.
o Grow the quality, talents and capacities of our development institutions;
o Introduce effective metrics and evaluation for accountability
Improve delivery and outcomes

Subject: Huff Post Renegade Excerpt
Of all his transition choices, none was easier to make, or more complex to execute, than Hillary Clinton as
secretary of state. Obama had long wanted his former rival on his team, no matter what his friends and aides
said about her aggressive campaign... His staff opposed the idea for the most part, arguing that Clinton would
never be truly loyal. But Obama was willing to leave the primaries behind, including his own strong feelings at
the time. "I don't hold grudges," he told his aides. "I don't worry about the past. I'm concerned about What
happens now. If she can help me and Bill Clinton isn't too much of a liability, we should seriously look at this."
Obama was under no illusion about the legacy of the long primary season. During one transition meeting,
Obama said he wanted to offer Clinton the diplomatic job. "I'm really interested in pursuing this, but I know she
has some hard feelings coming out of this campaign." Emanuel and John Podesta, the former Clinton official
who ran the transition, assured Obama that she was over those hard feelings now. Obama smiled and said,
"Believe me. She's not over it yet."
His decision to offer her the job of secretary of state came surprisingly early. Well before the end of the
primaries, when his staff and friends still felt hostile to her, Obama decided that Clinton possessed the qualities
to carry his diplomacy to the rest of the world. "We actually thought during the primary, when we were pretty
sure we were going to win, that she could end up being a very effective secretary of state," he told me later. "I
felt that she was disciplined, that she was precise, that she was smart as a whip, and that she would present a
really strong image to the world.. .I had that mapped out."
Recruiting and managing a team of rivals would not be easy, and Clinton came with her own set of issues. Chief
among them was her campaign debt, which she wanted eliminated before she took the job of secretary of state.
Would the president-elect go out and help her to do so? "I'm not begging her to take this job," Obama told his
senior aides. "If she wants it, I could help. But I'm not willing to go out in these difficult economic times to do a
flashy fundraiser in California." As it happened, plenty of people in the Senate were begging Obama to offer
Clinton the job. Obama's aides believed that many Senate Democrats thought Clinton had extended her
presidential campaign far beyond the point where she had lost the election. Her negative advertising wasted
Democratic money, threatened to undermine the party's nominee, and suggested that she was disloyal to the
party. They were unwilling to offer the junior New York senator a position ahead of her lowly rank, and she
stood little chance of becoming majority leader. "There was a lot of encouragement from inside the Senate to
get her into this job," said one senior Obama aide. "They wanted her out of there." ...
As for controlling the uncontrollable Bill Clinton, Obama's aides drew up a series of checks on his fundraising
for both Clinton Global Initiative and his work on HIV/AIDS across the world. But they really counted on

Hillary to be the ultimate safeguard - against both her husband and her own ambition. "It's in her interests to
keep him in line," warned one senior Obama aide. Others in Obama's inner circle said the president-elect
believed Clinton needed to demonstrate that she was a team player and to shape her own career and legacy.
"There are plenty who don't trust her and think she still harbors something," said another senior adviser. "It's
still potentially problematic down the road. Barack's thinking on this is that it's not in her interests to mess with
us. She can't win that fight internally and she's smart enough that she won't want that fight publicly."
Several weeks into the administration, even Clinton's internal critics believed the relationship was a success.
"They have both worked really hard at it," said one senior White House official. "There's a natural affinity and
respect that ironically grew out of being opponents. You get to know someone really well after all that."

Just saw Newsweek piece and went over site with Nora Nora can show to you. It's a leap for Newsweek to say that
the State Dept DipNote Twittering = Secretary Clinton Twittering. I did a scan (and will do a longer one) but there
appears to be no first person Twittering in Secretary's Clinton's name.

Hi Cheryl,
I do not believe there is Twittering in the Secretary's name. The Twittering is from DipNote, the State Department's Blog
http ://twitte r.co mid ipnote
It will occasionally quote the Secretary but the Twittering should not be done in her name.

But we should not be twittering in the Secretary's name since she is not the person actually twittering.
There is a reference in Newsweek to her twittering and says: Hillary Clinton Style: Dry info and offers 4,788 followers
Can you advise who is twittering in her name and how we can address?
Thanks.

Of all his transition choices, none was easier to make, or more complex to execute, than Hillary Clinton as secretary of
state. Obama had long wanted his former rival on his team, no matter what his friends and aides said about her
aggressive campaign... His staff opposed the idea for the most part, arguing that Clinton would never be truly loyal. But
Obama was willing to leave the primaries behind, including his own strong feelings at the time. "I don't hold grudges,"
he told his aides. "I don't worry about the past. I'm concerned about what happens now. If she can help me and Bill
Clinton isn't too much of a liability, we should seriously look at this." ...
Obama was under no illusion about the legacy of the long primary season. During one transition meeting, Obama said he
wanted to offer Clinton the diplomatic job. "I'm really interested in pursuing this, but I know she has some hard feelings
coming out of this campaign." Emanuel and John Podesta, the former Clinton official who ran the transition, assured
Obama that she was over those hard feelings now. Obama smiled and said, "Believe me. She's not over it yet."
His decision to offer her the job of secretary of state came surprisingly early. Well before the end of the primaries, when
his staff and friends still felt hostile to her, Obama decided that Clinton possessed the qualities to carry his diplomacy to
the rest of the world. "We actually thought during the primary, when we were pretty sure we were going to win, that
she could end up being a very effective secretary of state," he told me later. "I felt that she was disciplined, that she was

precise, that she was smart as a whip, and that she would present a really strong image to the world...I had that mapped
out."
Recruiting and managing a team of rivals would not be easy, and Clinton came with her own set of issues. Chief among
them was her campaign debt, which she wanted eliminated before she took the job of secretary of state. Would the
president-elect go out and help her to do so? "I'm not begging her to take this job," Obama told his senior aides. "If she
wants it, I could help. But I'm not willing to go out in these difficult economic times to do a flashy fundraiser in
California." As it happened, plenty of people in the Senate were begging Obama to offer Clinton the job. Obama's aides
believed that many Senate Democrats thought Clinton had extended her presidential campaign far beyond the point
where she had lost the election. Her negative advertising wasted Democratic money, threatened to undermine the
party's nominee, and suggested that she was disloyal to the party. They were unwilling to offer the junior New York
senator a position ahead of her lowly rank, and she stood little chance of becoming majority leader. "There was a lot of
encouragement from inside the Senate to get her into this job," said one senior Obama aide. "They wanted her out of
there." ...
As for controlling the uncontrollable Bill Clinton, Obama's aides drew up a series of checks on his fundraising for both
Clinton Global Initiative and his work on HIV/AIDS across the world. But they really counted on Hillary to be the ultimate
safeguard - against both her husband and her own ambition. "It's in her interests to keep him in line," warned one senior
Obama aide. Others in Obama's inner circle said the president-elect believed Clinton needed to demonstrate that she
was a team player and to shape her own career and legacy. "There are plenty who don't trust her and think she still
harbors something," said another senior adviser. "It's still potentially problematic down the road. Barack's thinking on
this is that it's not in her interests to mess with us. She can't win thaffight internally and she's smart enough that she
won't want that fight publicly."
Several weeks into the administration, even Clinton's internal critics believed the relationship was a success. "They have
both worked really hard at it," said one senior White House official. "There's a natural affinity and respect that ironically
grew out of being opponents. You get to know someone really well after all that."

'Renegade' CliffsNotes
By: Jonathan Martin
June 2, 2009 12:22 AM EST
The flood of books devoted to the 2008 campaign and President Barack Obama begins in
earnest this week with the release of "Renegade, The Making of a President," by former
Newsweek reporter Richard Wolfe.
Wolffe's account of the Obama campaign isn't to be officially released until Tuesday, but
POLITICO obtained a copy earlier this week.
Herewith are some of the book's most fascinating nuggets:
No Shrum Moment:
Before the election had been called, but when it looked promising for Obama the then-
candidate called his top adviser, David Axelrod.
"What's going on?" Obama asked.
"Look, I'm not going to say congratulations yet, but boy, it looks awfully good," Axelrod
replied.
Axelrod, Wolfe notes, wanted to avoid a repeat of 2004, when John Kerry's top adviser,
Bob Shrum, told the Massachusetts senator prematurely on election night that he wanted
to be the first to say, "Mr. President."
Pritzker Veers Off-Message (A little):
The impressive fundraising Obama demonstrated in 2007 was largely a result of the usual
high-dollar contributors — not the small-dollar donors the campaign liked to hold up to the
press.
"It wasn't the Internet," admitted Penny Pritzker, Obama's national finance chair.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761505 Date: 06/30/2015
Talking To Himself:
The revamped stump speech Obama gave to Iowa Democrats at their Jefferson-Jackson
Dinner in November of 2007 was borne out of a speech Obama scribe Jon Favreau had
written for the candidate earlier that month in South Carolina.
Favreau trimmed the original version and sent it to Obama who had to memorize it for
what became a pivotal moment leading up to the Iowa caucuses.
Aides were concerned that Obama was not prepared to give the speech, but he largely
got it right on his first run-through a day befOre the dinner.
The Politico 44 Story Widget Requires Adobe Flash Player.
"None of Obama's aides knew that the candidate had been rehearsing in his Des Moines
hotel room all week," Wolfe writes. [Press secretary Robert] Gibbs had walked by his
room a couple of times, heard a loud television behind the door, and wondered what was
going on. Obama had turned the volume up to practice the speech to himself, out of sight
and earshot of even his closest staff."
Michelle As Strategist:
The morning after Obama lost the early-March Ohio and Texas primaries, campaign
manager David Plouffe suffered through an uncomfortable car ride with the candidate and
his wife, Michelle Obama.
The future first lady, writes Wolfe, "threatened not to return to the campaign trail until they
had come up with a new strategy."
Says Plouffe: "I think she was pissed at both of us."
A Rev. Wright Sit-down:
After Obama gave his race speech in Philadelphia primary but before his former pastor,
the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, would make his now-infamous appearance at the National
Press Club, the candidate went to Chicago to meet with Wright.
Obama was trying to dissuade Wright from a "comeback tour" and told his former pastor to
expect a "media circus" if he reemerged.
Wright, Wolfe writes, wanted to tell his side of the story and felt like he was "the aggrieved
party."
Tough Words For Bill Clinton:
His wife is now Obama's secretary of state, but Obama had some tough words for the
120

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761505 Date: 06/30/2015
actions of former President Bill Clinton during the campaign.
"We had to figure out how to deal with a former president who was just lying, engaging in
bald-faced lies," Obama explained to Wolfe.
When the then-candidate was asked if Clinton got in his head, he replied: "Yes, but I got
into his."
Later, when considering who to name as his running mate, Obama told aides that if Hillary
Clinton would help politically she ought to be considered.
"But I'm concerned about Bill Clinton being a loose cannon," Obama said, according to
Wolfe.
Joe Biden Wants His Damn Calls Returned
When Sen. John McCain wouldn't return the phone calls of Sen. Joe Biden, the never-
subtle Delawarean sought out his longtime colleague.
In New York City with Obama and McCain where the two were both appearing at a public
service event on the anniversary of 9/11, Biden was rebuffed by McCain's aides
backstage when he asked to see the GOP nominee.
So, Wolfe writes, Biden went to McCain's green room door and knocked.
"John McCain,' he shouted, according to Wolfe. "It's Joe Biden. The next time I phone
you, take the damn call."
Rendell Drinks The Obama Kool-Aid — Literally
After Obama locked up the nomination, Pennsylvania Gov. and ardent Clinton supporter
Ed Rendell got a note from an Obama supporter attached to a can of Kool-Aid telling him
to drink up.
So the next day at a Philadephla fundraiser for the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, the
ever-demonstrative governor poured it into a glass of water and proclaimed: "Now I feel
that Senator Obama is the most wonderful person ever to have lived in the United States
of America. The smartest, most sensitive most decent and honorable man. Now I
understand what you guys have been feeling for the last six months."
"The Old Man":
Plouffe told Wolfe that they never considered going after the 72-year-old McCain on his
age, but the author notes that some in Obama's high command enjoyed references to the
GOP nominee's age and one staffer had a nickname for the Republican: "the old man."

"espionage" did not appear in the KCNA report. I also mentioned that we were not aware of recent cases where
previously detained Amcits in the DPRK were "indicted" and "brought to trial." I said I wouldn't read too much into
terms such as "illegal entry" and "suspected hostile acts"; I was still convinced that the track we've been pursuing, i.e.
gaining consular access through the Swedish Amb. in Pyongyang, and contact via other diplomatic channels, offered
hope for a resolution.
Mr. Gore said he very much appreciated the call. He asked that we convey as much of this information as we could to

Food Aid Flexibility, Overseas Investment Up for Panel
Consideration
By Adam Graham-Silverman, CQ Staff .
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee plans to approve a bill Tuesday aimed at spurring a "green revolution"
to combat global food insecurity, in part by loosening restrictions on using U.S. aid to buy food overseas.
The legislation (S 384) would authorize $500 million for a new emergency food assistance fund that could be
used to buy food in the affected region instead of buying it in the United States and shipping it overseas. Critics
say that system costs too much, takes too long to provide aid and depresses local prices when U.S. products
arrive.
The bill, by panel ranking Republican Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, also would create a global food "czar"
position at the White House and authorize $7.75 billion for agriculture research and exchange programs through
fiscal 2014.
"We can bring America's dedication to science, innovation, technology and education together to lead an effort
devoted to overcoming the obstacles to food security," Lugar said upon introducing the bill last month.
To keep up with rising population and an expanding middle class in countries such as China and India, farmers
will have to double their food output by 2050, Lugar said. At the same time, he said, the share of U.S.
development spending devoted to agriculture dropped from 25 percent in 1980 to 1 percent in 2003.
Anti-hunger activists support Lugar's effort to allow local purchase of food, but past efforts have run into farm-
state interests that support requirements to buy U.S. crops. The bill would give the president discretion to use
the fund to meet "unexpected urgent food assistance needs."

The program, which turns a profit, directs private capital to developing countries by offering U.S. businesses
and lenders political risk insurance and investment financing.
OPIC's temporary reauthorization expires at the end of fiscal 2009.
The House passed a long-term reauthorization in the 110th Congress, but it stalled in the Senate when
Tom Coburn, R-Okla., objected to language to encourage projects to address greenhouse gas emissions. That
language was not included in this bill, in part because OPIC already examines its projects' greenhouse gas
impact and also because of expectations that the Obama administration's plans for climate change legislation
would impose a similar requirement.
Coburn also argued that the program failed to target the world's poorest countries, lacked accountability and
gave too much in loans to large corporations.
The reauthorization would bar OPIC assistance to companies that have loans to, or sizable investments in, the
energy sector of any state that sponsors terrorism. It would aim to reward countries with oil, gas or gems that
have adopted transparent accounting systems.
The markup is scheduled for 2:15 p.m. Tuesday in S-116 Capitol.

None of these candidates is,over 32 years old. The best writer among them is the youngest — 24. She is intellectually
extremely mature and the only professional writer in the group.
On the other hand,
she's extremely smart and an excellent writer.
I have two more candidates who are working on second rounds of mock speeches. I need to see how quickly and
effectively they grasp directions and feedback. Hopefully one of them will work out for us.
One other prospect materialized yesterday; am waiting to get a better feel for her suitability. I'm also re-mining
journalistic contacts to see if I can possibly find a more seasoned writer from a newspaper or magazine who wants to
make the switch to government. So far that has proven futile; the few journalists who I've reached out to were not
interested in coming.
Will keep you posted.

Draft Letter Signals Clinton Ready For
Equal Treatment at State
By Kerry Eleveld
The Advocate has obtained a draft of a letter from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to employees of the State Department
that details her intentions to extend certain benefits to same-sex partners of foreign service officers posted abroad.
"Historically, domestic partners of Foreign Service members have not been provided the same training, benefits, allowances,
and protections that other family members receive. These inequities are unfair and must end. Providing training, medical
care and other benefits to domestic partners promote the cohesiveness, safety and effectiveness of our Posts abroad," says
the letter.
The letter explains that the department will be "exercising its inherent authority to change its regulations in the Foreign
Affairs Manual and Department of State Standardized Regulations" in order to allow domestic partners of foreign service
personnel to qualify as family members. "Where appropriate, this extension of benefits and allowances will apply to the
children of domestic partners as well."
Providing these benefits to all employees, notes the letter, will help the department "attract and retain personnel in a
competitive environment where domestic partner benefits and allowances are increasingly the norm for world-class
employers. At bottom, the Department will provide these benefits for both opposite-sex and same-sex domestic partners
because it is the right thing to do."
The letter appears to be the culmination of Secretary Clinton's work with LGBT employee groups at the State Department. A
source familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the letter was drafted by senior officials at
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761559 Date: 06/30/2015

the department and represents the Secretary's thinking on the issue. The letter currently awaits final approval from senior
government lawyers.
The draft is consistent with statements made this week by California Congressman Howard Berman that Secretary Clinton
is committed to equalizing the treatment of gay employees of the State Department and that he anticipated an
announcement on the matter soon.
Full text of the letter is below:
DRAFT INTERNAL RELEASE
For Review
Today, I am pleased to announce that the Department of State will be extending a number of benefits and allowances to
domestic partners of members of the Foreign Service assigned abroad.
While a career in the Foreign Service is rewarding, the demands to serve our country both at home and abroad also require
great sacrifice by our Foreign Service personnel and their families as well. Family members often must uproot their lives,
endure hardship conditions, and put their own careers on hold. Like all families, our Foreign Service families come in
different configurations; all are part of the common fabric of our Post communities abroad.
Historically, domestic partners of Foreign Service members have not been provided the same training, benefits, allowances,
and protections that other family members receive. These inequities are unfair and must end. Providing training, medical
care and other benefits to domestic partners promote the cohesiveness, safety and effectiveness of our Posts abroad. It will
also help the Department attract and retain personnel in a competitive environment where domestic partner benefits and
allowances are increasingly the norm for world-class employers. At bottom, the Department will provide these benefits for
both opposite-sex and same-sex domestic partners because it is the right thing to do.
The Department will be exercising its inherent authority to change its regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual and
Department of State Standardized Regulations to allow the domestic partners of Department Foreign Service personnel to
qualify as family members for a variety of benefits and allowances. Where appropriate, this extension of benefits and
allowances will apply to the children of domestic partners as well. To qualify for these benefits and allowances, an employee
must file an affidavit identifying his or her domestic partner and certifying to certain eligibility requirements that will be set
forth in the FAM.
The Department of State intends to provide the following additional benefits and allowances for declared domestic partners of
eligible employees serving overseas:
Diplomatic passports,
Inclusion on employee travel orders to and from posts abroad,
Shipment of household effects,
Inclusion in family size calculations for the purpose of making housing allocations,
Family member preference for employment at posts abroad,
Use of medical facilities at posts abroad,
Medical evacuation from posts abroad,
Emergency travel for the partners to visit gravely ill or injured employees,
Inclusion as family members for emergency evacuation from posts abroad,
Subsistence payments related to emergency evacuation from posts abroad,
Inclusion in calculations of payments of overseas differentials and allowances (e.g., payment for quarters, cost of
living, and other allowances),
Representation expenses, and
Training at the Foreign Service Institute.

The Department also will work with our inter-agency partners and host country governments to provide domestic partners
with diplomatic visas, appropriate diplomatic and consular privileges and immunities, and authorization to work in the local
economy abroad.
We look forward to implementing these changes.

Obama picks financial backer for UK ambassador post Chicago friend Louis Susman chosen for plum posting despite
president's promise to end cronyism in Washington Ewen MacAskill in Washington Wednesday May 20 2009
guardian.co.uk
A little bit of Chicago's ruthless and combative political machine is soon to descend on the decorous calm of the Court of
St James. Despite promising to end cronyism in Washington, Barack Obama is about to appoint one of his home town
friends and financial backers to the plum posting of US ambassador to London.
The next ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary will be Louis Susman, a lawyer and financier with little
experience of foreign affairs.
The appointment will end months of speculation. Susman's name first surfaced in a diary column in the Washington Post
in February, but Caroline Kennedy was also mentioned, as was Oprah Winfrey, another of Obama's Chicago supporters.
There was no official confirmation of Susman's nomination today, but the Guardian has learned that the paperwork has
been completed. Buckingham Palace approved the appointment this month and Obama will announce it shortly.
London has become a retirement posting for many backers of US presidents, offering a comfortable home in one of the
best mansions in the city, Winfield House in Regent's Park.
Recent ambassadors have been political appointees more interested in country walks than Iraq or nuclear non-
proliferation. Most of the work is left to the number twos at the embassy, career diplomats.
Susman, 71, a vice-president of Citigroup until he retired in February, has long been a backer of the Democrats,
nicknamed the Vacuum Cleaner by the Chicago Tribune for his ability to hoover up campaign funding. "I don't think
anyone enjoys raising money, but for some reason I seem to have a knack," he told the paper. Susman, who lives in an
expensive neighbourhood of Chicago overlooking Lake Michigan, raised at least $500,000 (?320,000) for Obama's
campaign and a further $300,000 for his inauguration.
He is so much a part of Obama's inner circle that he was invited to an exclusive party on the Sunday before the
inauguration. Other guests included Rahm Emanuel, Obama's chief of staff, who typifies the sharp-suited, foul-mouthed
approach of those brought up on Chicago politics.
London is not the only posting being used to reward political supporters.
Other positions in Europe are expected to be filled on the basis of patronage. Dan Rooney, owner of the Pittsburgh
Steelers football team, who campaigned for Obama, is to be the ambassador to Dublin.

The appointments will disappoint former US career diplomats who have been pressing Obama to end the practice,
especially since he promised to offer more of the top jobs to diplomats. In the Washington Post in December, a retired
diplomat with 30 years' service, Morton Abramowitz, called on Obama to "declare that he will not appoint ambassadors
who have secured their posts through financial contributions and who have little background to merit any such
appointment".
Ronald Neumann, a former career diplomat and ambassador and president of the Washington-based American
Academy of Diplomacy, wrote to Obama last year, saying ambassadors should have had experience of the country they
are being appointed to. Neumann said today: "You would think with our most important ally we might occasionally send
someone with some experience."
• Historically, about 25% to 30% of the diplomatic posts have been political appointees. It is too early to say, but Obama's
ratio could yet be lower.
The president's choice of Susman could be viewed as a snub to the UK. The relationship between the Obama
administration and the UK government got off to a bad start. At least one member of the administration was irritated
over the leaking during the campaign of a memo from the British ambassador, Sir Nigel Sheinwald, assessing Obama as
"aloof". But the minor rows over the memo, the removal of the Churchill bust from the Oval office, the DVD present to
Gordon Brown and other perceived slights have been presentational problems rather than a sign of ruptured relations.
Obama's predecessor, George W Bush, sent two of his financier backers to the
UK: William Farish, a Texas multimillionaire, and Robert Tuttle, a California car dealer. The lack of an experienced
diplomat in London was felt most in the runup to the war in Iraq in 2003, with Farish invisible when a figure was needed
to put the US case on camera and in print.

Richard Wolfe
Wolffe covered the entire length of Barack Obama's presidential campaign for Newsweek magazine, traveling
with the candidate and his inner circle from his announcement through election day, 21 months later.
As a political analyst on MS7VBC, he appears frequently on Countdown with Keith Olbermann and Hardball. On
NBC, he has featured as a political commentator on Meet The Press and TODAY. He features prominently in
the forthcoming HBO documentary on the Obama campaign, and played a leading role in the HBO
documentary of the 2000 Bush campaign, Journeys With George. He previously appeared on CNN and Fox
News, as well as international media including British, Canadian and Australian television.
He now writes regularly for The Daily Beast.
As Newsweek's senior White House correspondent, his cover stories included What He Believes (on Obama's
faith) Black & White (about Obama and racial politics), Bush In The Bubble (after Hurricane Katrina) and
Weight of the World (how Bush handled the Lebanon war). Wolfe joined Newsweek in November 2002 as
diplomatic correspondent, covering foreign policy and international affairs. In the 2004 presidential election, he
covered the Howard Dean campaign before switching to John Kerry.
Before Newsweek, Wolfe was a senior journalist at the Financial Times, serving as its deputy bureau chief and
U.S. diplomatic correspondent in Washington. He reported on U.S. foreign policy, covered the Microsoft
antitrust trial, as well as regulatory and business issues at Treasury, the Federal Trade Commission and
Securities and Exchange Commission.
In April 2009, he joined Public Strategies, a business advisory firm, as Senior Strategist.
Wolfe is the co-author of The Victim's Fortune, (HarperCollins, 2002), about the deals that led to billions of
dollars in compensation to the Nazis' victims in the late 1990s. He also co-authored two Spanish cookbooks,
Tapas: A Taste of Spain in America (Clarkson Potter in the US and Planeta in Spain, 2005) and Made in Spain:
Spanish Dishes for the American Kitchen (Clarkson Potter, 2008). He has also written for food magazines such
as Food Arts and Food & Wine. He authored an upcoming book on Obama's campaign called Renegade: The
Making of a President.
Born in in Birmingham, England, Wolffe is a 1992 graduate of Oxford University, first-class honors, in English
and French literature.

Gay groups grow impatient with Obama
By: Ben Smith and Jonathan Martin
June 4, 2009 04:32 AM EST
President Barack Obama's promises of change are falling short for one core Democratic
constituency: gays and lesbians, whose leaders say Obama's administration isn't keeping
up with the times.
Gay rights campaigners, most of them Democrats who supported Obama in November,
have begun to voice their public frustration with Obama's inaction, small jokes at their
community's expense and deafening silence on what they see as the signal civil rights
issue of this era.
His most important campaign promises repealing the Defense of Marriage Act and the
military ban on openly gay and lesbian service-members have not been fulfilled.
And the news, which emerged quietly earlier this year, that he'd supported same-sex
marriage back in 1996, then changed his mind, especially rankles. As mainstream
Democratic politicians such as Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) move to support same-sex
marriage, gay rights advocates say that the barrier-breaking president looks increasingly
odd for opposing what they see as full equality.
"Obama is out of step with his party, which is overwhelmingly in favor of marriage at this
stage," said David Mixner, a veteran gay rights activist who is among the organizers of a
march on Washington for same-sex marriage scheduled for this fall. "He's out of step with
the next generation."
Gay rights issues have been moving at breakneck speed, none faster than same-sex
marriage. Most public opinion polls now show more than 40 percent of Americans support
same-sex marriage, seen as a fringe issue just a few years earlier. Already, five New
England states and Iowa have same-sex marriage laws on the books.
"Politicians are finding out that their voters are moving faster than they anticipated," said
Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who called Obama's place behind that curve

"surprising, because he is the next-generational candidate."
She noted that Obama could be concerned about alienating older voters in the Midwest
who would be turned off if he came out in support of same-sex marriage.

The White House has been reluctant to spend its political capital pushing Obama's
highest-profile pro-gay positions believing, White House allies say, that it could detract
from priorities like health care. And it may be even less likely to do next year, with
midterms approaching.
But officials have told restive gays and lesbians to give them until the end of this month to
show movement on a number of lower-profile issues they support, including restrictions on
visas for people with HIV. The Pentagon also has toned down public opposition to
reversing the gay ban, and the new secretary of the Army's job will be, in part, to smooth
the way for that move.
"The president remains fully committed to advancing LGBT rights. His positions on all of
these issues are well-established and well-known. His staff continues to work with
Congress on a variety of LGBT issues," said Jim Messina, the deputy White House chief
of staff who is the point man on gay and lesbian issues, citing White House efforts to
move hate crimes legislation through the Senate. "While we recognize that some in the
community are anxious, the president's commitment has not wavered."
Meanwhile, however, marriage equality has emerged as the movement's central issue, a
question that's seen as a simple matter of justice and fairness by a growing number of
Democrats.
"There's going to come a point where's he going have to deal with it," former Democratic
National Committee Chairman Howard Dean, who now supports same-sex marriage, said
of Obama. "I'm in favor of giving him a little more time. He's got an awful lot on his plate."
"But he is a politician like everybody else, and he's going to respond to pressure. And I
don't blame the LGBT community for trying to push," Dean said.
Rep. Jared Polis (D-Colo.), who is openly gay and was a major Democratic donor before
being elected last year, said he was "very hopeful [Obama's] position will evolve."
But Polls warned, "If his position doesn't evolve, it could turn off some strong supporters."
Gay leaders in Washington, though, have been loath to publicly criticize the president.
They say they still view Obama as an ally and think private talks are more promising than
public pressure.
Still, it was especially frustrating for some left-leaning gay figures to see the otherwise
dreaded former Vice President Dick Cheney publicly express his support this week for
letting states allow gay marriage -- a position that puts him to theleft of Obama.

"I think that freedom means freedom for everyone," Cheney said in an appearance
Monday at the National Press Club.
Obama also has been criticized for a joke at the expense of same-sex marriage. After the
White House Correspondents Association dinner, columnist Dan Savage fumed that
Obama's only reference since being sworn in to the high-profile drive toward same-sex
marriage in Iowa had been a joke about going to the state with longtime friend and adviser
David Axelrod to "make it official."
"The best he can do — all he's willing to do — is toss off an Adam Sandler-level joke,"
Savage wrote.
Another Obama ally, writer Andrew Sullivan, recently referred to Obama's stance on gays
as "the fierce urgency of whenever."
And on the front line, in the states, gay rights advocates are also growing increasingly
impatient with Washington.
"His position has been causing some problems for those of us working in the states, those
who are against it are using him for cover," said Alan Van CapeIle, the executive director
of New York's Empire State Pride Agenda, who called on Obama to fulfill another
neglected campaign promise and back the full repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act,
which blocks the federal government from extending benefits to married same-sex
couples.
Gay activists cringed recently when reminded by Donald Trump, of all people, that Miss
California Carrie Prejean shared the same position on gay marriage as the progressive
president.
"I'm still optimistic that the president is going to be good on his word," said Aubrey Sarvis,
the executive director of the Servicemembers Legal Defense Networks, which opposes
the military ban.
"No one believes that [anti-gay federal policies] will be miraculously changed overnight,"
said Human Rights Campaign president Joe Solmonese, who added nevertheless that his
group is "frustrated at the pace of progress."
Behind the scenes, patience is wearing thin.
"People are far angrier than they're saying publicly, because they don't want to jeopardize
[White House] relationships with the groups," said John Aravosis, an openly gay blogger
who speaks to gay leaders. "But everyone is feeling like we've entered a danger zone
where the administration is backing away from us fast, and I can tell you that the
professional gay crowd in Washington, D.C., to a person, feels a sense of impending
betrayal."
The most heated battle is in California, where some of the same voters who
overwhelmingly elected Obama also passed a referendum barring same-sex marriage.
Proposition 8 has since energized the state's gay rights movement.

The Army linguist, Dan Choi, spoke at a rally across the street from the Beverly Hills Hilton
while Obama spoke inside at a high-dollar fundraiser late last month. The group
organizing the rally, the Courage Campaign, has gathered 140,000 signatures on a letter
to Obama asking him to rescind the ban.
Back at the fundraiser, Messina had the same message delivered in a somewhat more
intimate setting.
He was walking through the men's room at the Beverly Hilton when Mike Bonin, an activist
and former Obama campaign staffer who loves the president "the way Walt Whitman
loved Abe Lincoln," confronted him.
"I told him I was disappointed that [Obama] talked about justice and equal opportunity and
across the street stands Dan Choi, who's about to be booted out of the Army," he recalled
of the faucet-side chat.
Messina, Bonin said, responded that the White House hadn't forgotten, and complained
that the administration hasn't gotten enough credit for pushing to outlaw hate crimes
against gays and lesbians, but was ultimately "noncommittal." Bonin, who said he kept
Messina standing by the sinks for about ten minutes before letting him proceed to his
destination, said marriage advocates in California have been using Obama campaign
tools and strategies to push the White House.
"All the people who signed this petition for Choi, all the people who are outside across the
street at this rally, all the people who are coming to these [political training camps] are
Obama people who love and support our president," he said. "But he didn't stand up for
us, and until he does we're going to love him enough to be tough on him."
Correction: Hate crimes legislation has passed the House, but not the Senate; an earner
version of this story wrongly reported that it had become law.

Subject: Dyncorps Post Story -- Second Shoe To Drop
Folks,
You may recall an April 17 Post story on problems with Dyncorps in Afghanistan which focused on a suspected
drug overdose death, breakdown in internal controls within the company, and actions the USG and the firm
were taking. The other issue that surfaced at the time was a colossal error in judgment by one of the
contractors' employees in hiring an adolescent boy dancer for some sort of event that, at least to most folks,
looked very inappropriate. The Post is now looking at the dancing boy, which was not included in the April 17,
article, and we expect will soon publish a story on it.
The Post inquiry at this point focuses only on confirming whether or not there's an OIG investigation. We are,
of course, referring the Post to the OIG on such a question. However, the premise for the question raises the
issue again in some eye-popping rhetoric which could feature in the follow-up story, so I wanted to make sure
everyone had a heads-up.
We have already relieved the folks involved with both incidents and I am meeting with the firm's CEO today to
hear his report on his trip to Afghanistan and Iraq to address these, as well as other, issues on which we have
demanded corrective actions.
I'm attaching the original note to Deputy Secretary Lew at the time of the original inquiry which lays out both
issues, a copy of the memo the INL section at Embassy Kabul provided to Post Management on the most
recent Post inquiry, as well as the Post inquiry itself for context.
David.
Incoming from Post:
"According to my reporting, the week of April 13th, the DynCorp regional commander from Konduz, Flint Chambers,
allowed his men to hire a 15-year-old boy dancer to do tribal dances at a DynCorp party on the training site.
Some 15 or so DynCorp employees in attendance pulled out a single chair and had the boy do mock lap dances. This
was captured on video. The video shows DynCorp employees putting dollar bills in the boy's waistband, just as they would
a stripper's garter. The revelry lasted about 45 minutes.

No sex took place.
The video was leaked to Kabul INL program manager, Marissa Martin. INL Washington ordered INL Kabul to replace the
entire DynCorp chain of commaand.
The video was leaked by Mike Gonzalez to another DynCorp employee who emailed the video to Martin. Flint Chambers
retaliated against Mike by spitting in his face, pushing him to the ground in front of the DynCorp security building in Kabul.
Chambers was fired, along with Dean Deines, Stan Knee and David Kelly.
Can you confirm that the IG is looking into this? (in addition to the Kurt Schafer incident)
Thank you,

Thanks for the opportunity to suggest a line or two -
1. As a Yankees fan (though not as expert as Kris), and an eyewitness to the "cap" fiasco, I share everyone's
sensitivity to sports references. But I'm not dead set against trying to leverage that sensitivity in a self-
deprecating, appropriately funny way. A couple thoughts along those lines:
a. "As you can see, I resisted the urge to wear my Yankees cap."
b. (if the stage is set up near, for example, second base; substitute whatever part of the field she's near) "This
is about as close as I'm going to get to playing second base for the Yankees"
c. "I kind of feel at home here in Yankee Stadium, because ever since January, I've been playing on a team
with a bunch of guys wearing pinstripes."
(on the other hand, I'm a little concerned about suggesting that the 1923 team "looked the same, talked the
same, and came from the same cities and towns" - seems to be a little dismissive of a team that included such
outsized personalities as Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig.
Also, saying "Today's Yankees play with the strength of a global team" could provoke an unintended laugh
because they are playing so poorly this year, so far. Maybe safer to broaden it to all of baseball - like "Major
League Baseball is comprised of truly global teams."
And the "I don't care whether you bring us home a World Series" seems like stretching too far for a sports
metaphor, but in a way that doesn't really make sense in context. maybe better as "I have every confidence that
you will. ..You are starting your post-graduate life on a field of dreams, and you have every reason to believe
that your own dreams of a better world can come true." (or something akin to that).
2. I think the speech could benefit from one clear "soundbite" that more succinctly captures the essence of her
remarks. More of a clarion call to service, something like:
"...And I hope some of you will join our ranks. But the State Department cannot go up against the great
challenges of our time alone. And so my message to you today is this: be the special envoys of your ideals,
using the vast communications tools at your disposal to help advance the interests of this nation and every
nation. Be citizen ambassadors in the course of your personal and professional lives, helping to forge

can extend the powers of our and every government to meet the needs of this generation.. .and help lay the
groundwork for the kind of public-private alliances we need to end hunger, defeat disease, combat global
warming and give every child the chance to live up to her or his God-given potential."
(and maybe go from there into a little riff like "Don't sell yourselves short. Many of you showed your capacity
to bring change by helping bring Barack Obama to the presidency." (And then, after the inevitable applause at
that line, follow with this quip, with a smile: "Where were you when I needed you?")
Finally, just a couple small notes:
-- "half of my senior staff used to work here" - the word "here" given that it's in Yankee Stadium might confuse
a little - better perhaps to say "used to work at NYU."
-- "swine flu" - hasn't the government been trying to avoid using that phrase? (I like that sentence overall)
-- nice examples with Colombia and Kilimanjaro - though just wondering, since I'm ignorant of the facts, is it
too much to say that the Facebook project really did more than years of military action?
-- if you happen to like the Obama reference above, then it would supplant the "social networking platforms"
line in the speech - but if you don't like my suggestion, I would still suggest changing the "I am told" as that
sounds a little gratuitous - better to be a little more self-deprecating, like "And there was also a recent
presidential election in which social networks brought legions of young people into the electoral process. ..a few
more into certain campaigns than others, I'm afraid to say..." or something like that.
-- also, if you don't use the suggested Obama reference, I do think his name should be used somewhere in the
speech.
-- "suited up" doesn't sound like HRC to my ear.
love the examples of things people can do online to make a difference, also like and agree with idea of being
short and punchy.
thanks again for the chance to suggest a couple thoughts...

Dear Cheryl
Following a few discussions with Dick Gephardt - I have pleasure in laying out fairly detailed information about a
conference that is being held in Demark on 3-4 December 2009.
We have made the note reasonably in-depth so hopefully will provide you with sufficient background. The organisers of
the event which are ATP - the largest Danish Pension Fund and the Climate Consortium Denmark are being sponsored
and backed by the Danish government and they were very hopeful that Hillary would be able to be the key note speaker
at the conference for reasons that they have identified in the attached briefing document.
We were hoping to establish whether this event would be of interest for Hillary to appear and if she was available we
would then arrange for the formal invite to be sent out by the Danish Government.
If we can provide any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.
With very Best wishes

War Supplemental Conference Slips to Next Week
By Josh Rogin, CQ Staff
House leadership has decided not to hold a conference or a vote on the war supplemental spending bill this
week, as leaders worked behind the scenes to secure enough Democratic votes to pass the measure absent GOP
support.
Multiple lawmakers and aides confirmed the expected Thursday session to finalize negotiations over the bill
(HR 2346), which is mainly to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, will not occur until at least early next
week. Democratic leaders were trying to convince as many as 18 of the 51 Democrats who voted against the
House version in May to change their votes, but many said they would not do so.
Republicans are promising to vote against the conference report en mass if it includes $5 billion worth of
funding related to the International Monetary Fund. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Thursday it
would.
"I believe there are people in the Republican Party who support [the IMF funding]; they just don't want to
support it on this bill," Pelosi said Thursday, "So we have to do that with all Democratic votes."
She also pushed back against two key pillars of the House Republican leadership's argument against the IMF
funding, which is meant to accommodate an increased U.S. credit extension to the organization.
Responding to statements of Minority Leader John A. Boehner of Ohio that the IMF money is unrelated to the
war spending measure, Pelosi said the IMF help was a "national security initiative" because it helps to alleviate
sources of instability, such as poverty.
Pelosi also accused House Minority Whip Eric Cantor, R-Va., of fear mongering by putting out a statement
warning that IMF assistance could somehow fund terrorism.
"I don't know why anyone would say that the money is going to the hands of terrorists," she said. "It simply is
not based in fact and is a scare tactic, and most unfortunate."
House Democratic aides said the conference on the supplemental bill probably would be early next week.
"We're going to come up with a supplemental conference report in the next few days," said Senate Majority
leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.

Whipping Votes
House leaders had planned to hold the conference session Thursday and had said the House floor vote could be
as early as Friday. But their effort to convince members to switch their no votes was still underway Thursday
afternoon. •
Although several high ranking Democrats have pledged to switch their no votes, including Reps. Barney Frank,
D-Mass., and George Miller, D-Calif., many others have said they would not.
"It's a conscience vote," said Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., who said he was inclined to not change his stance on
the bill
"I haven't cracked yet," said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., who along with other anti-war Democrats has
pledged to be against any war funding that does not provide for the withdrawal of troops from southwest Asia.
Still, many Democrats said that the leadership was lobbying them relatively intensely.
More Details Emerge
Meanwhile, more details of the near finalized supplemental conference report negotiations came out Thursday.
Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, said that the final bill will "in all
likelihood" include money for 5 C-130 transport planes and 8 C-17 cargo planes, none of which was requested
by the administration or in the Senate's bill. The House bill had sought 11 C-130s and the 8 C-17s.
Overall, the defense portion of the bill is expected to be about $4 billion less than the House version but still
billions above the Senate version and the administration request, House Appropriations Defense subcommittee
chairman John P. Murtha, D-Pa., said.
As for the fate of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the conference report likely will include language
barring the administration from transferring prisoners to U.S. soil for the remainder of the fiscal year, said
House Appropriator James P. Moran, D-Va.
No money towards the president's effort to close the prisons will be in the conference report, Moran added. The
president had requested $80 million but neither the House nor Senate versions included those funds.

First of all, thank you again for the telcon and heads up, I very much appreciated the consideration
and professional courtesy.
Per our conversation, if it is still helpful, I have a couple of candidates to suggest for the deputy slot at
USAID. Perhaps you have already heard of these individuals, given that they are well known in the
international development arena.
These are all superb career officers. I know each person very well, and have seen them in various
positions where they consistently handled the most complex, difficult and important assignments in an
outstanding manner. The all have terrific reputations, and are highly regarded in USAID, State, and
on the Hill.

Many Haitians See Bill Clinton Appointment as Setting Up Protectorate
Port-au-Prince Le Matin
June 5, 2009
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's recent appointment of former US President Clinton to serve as special envoy to
Haiti has been perceived by many groups, including lawmakers, political analysts, political leaders, and media
commentators, as a step toward putting Haiti in a protectorate or trusteeship status. They questioned in particular the
extent of Clinton's powers and the term of his mandate, wondering what role will be attributed to Haiti's elected
representatives. Several pointed out that Heidi Annabi, Ban's special representative in Haiti, and President Rene Preval
would be subservient to Clinton, their senior in rank and described by some media as Haiti's new chief. As expected,
Haitian Government officials and most foreign diplomats hailed this nomination and expressed their optimism about it.
Several political leaders objected to Clinton's being named special envoy to Haiti, saying that it showed the international
community wanted to bring Haiti under its control.
o Former Senate President Belizaire, president of the National Council of the Haitian Political Parties, pointed out that
Haiti has had a foreign force in the country, the UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), since 2004 and now has
an envoy such as President Clinton who is in a "higher position than any other UN personnel." These both indicate the
country is being considered a "genuine protectorate," according to Belizaire (Signal FM, 27 May).
o Socialist Identity and Liberty Collective spokesman Cherubin referred to Clinton's mission as an umpteenth "civil
commission," alluding to the administrative steps France took to restore order and peace when Haiti was under French
rule, intended to speed up the process of "taking charge" of Haiti. Cherubin added that in the current international
jargon this is called "colonialism of a third type, or colonialism of necessity"
(www.alterpresse.org, 22 May).
o According to Christian Movement for a New Haiti leader Mesadieux, Ban's decision will further help put Haiti under
foreign supervision. He asserted that the international community wants to reinforce its control over Haiti's
administration (Radio Vision 2000, 21 May).
o Dr. Eugene of the Haitian Social Christian Party, speaking on the "Pickup Talk Show" live from the United States, said
that "Clinton's responsibility is to control events in Haiti and he will control them in a firm manner" (Radio Caraibes FM,
23 May). Eugene was "offended" by this appointment and called it "a shame for all Haitians" and "a slap in the face of
the entire nation" (Radio Galaxie, 29 May).

Lawmakers and political analysts, who questioned how far Clinton's powers would extend and described him as a
colonial administrator, also concluded that Haiti was under trusteeship or protectorate status.
oSenate President Bastien, who said the UN usually sends special emissaries only to "places where there are crises and
conflicts," wondered why former President Clinton had been named special envoy to Haiti. He particularly questioned
the extent of Clinton's mandate, asking "where do his powers end?" and concluded that the ongoing rumors of Haiti
being put under trusteeship will be confirmed if clarifications are not offered (Radio Vision 2000, 26 May).
o Professor Lalanne, a former ambassador under the Duvalier regime, described Clinton as "the new administrator of
the colony called Haiti." Lalanne said this nomination shows that the international community is not happy with Annabi's
work. He added that he had "no other interpretation [of the appointment other than it Is]... a reinforcement of the
occupation" (Radio Kiskeya, 25 May).
oReacting to the appointment, political analyst Gracien Jean referred to Article 76 of the UN fundamental charter and
said that although Haiti is not a classic protectorate with an administrator, the very fact that it cannot administer itself
and has foreign forces in charge of ensuring its security, is an indication that the country is "under trusteeship or
protectorate status because in principle there is partial restriction of its sovereignty" (Radio Vision 2000, 26 May).
Media commentators highlighted the powers conferred to President Clinton as minimizing the role of Haitian or UN
officials.
oThe oldest and most famous Haitian newspaper, Le Nouvelliste, questioned in an editorial what mandate former
President Clinton would have in his new role. The paper noted that even though Clinton was presented as "an
international lawyer for Haiti," the country's moderate national ists consider him the new "governor general," recalling
the title given by France to colonial Haiti's highest authority. The paper further asked what role Haiti's elected
representatives would have if President Clinton has responsibility for "a complete political program." Moreover, the
editorial questioned how long the program would last (20 May).
o In an article entitled "Haiti Under High Surveillance," journalist Nancy Roc, host of Radio Metropole's famous weekly
talk show "Metropolis," reported: "This nomination establishes the eviction of the Latin Americans and represents the
response of the Obama Administration to the powerlessness and irresponsibility of the Haitian rulers.... Through this
nomination, Haiti has a new chief.... Annabi and Preval are relegated to a position of secondary importance and will have
to execute to the letter any instructions from [Clinton] their senior in rank (Le Matin, 25 May).
Predictably, government officials and foreign diplomats hailed Clinton's mission and emphasized its beneficial
socioeconomic influence.
oLe Nouvelliste reported on 19 May that "President Preval received this nomination favorably," saying that it is "a vital
push" for assuring Haiti's needs remain "a priority for the international community." Responding to a journalist who
asked him about Haiti being put under protectorate status, Preval replied that he knew Haiti, as a UN member, was like
many countries with problems who have accepted UN help (Radio Vision 2000, 26 May).
o Prime Minister Pierre-Louis saw in the naming of President Clinton a positive sign all the more so since he is "a long
time friend of Haiti." She said it was in the interest of the country to take advantage of all international opportunities
(Radio Caraibes FM, 21 May).
oMINUSTAH spoke of its limits to help social and economic problems, and stressed the appropriateness and the
importance of President Clinton's mission after the hurricanes that hit Haiti last year (Le Nouvelliste, 20 May).

o The Chilean Chancery said in a communique issued on 26 May that it received this nomination with "total
approbation" and expected it to help put Haiti's economic and social development and reconstruction on the
international agenda (www.radiokiskeya.com, 26 May).
On another note, however, OAS representatiave in Haiti, Ricardo Seitenfus reacted defensively to rumors about
President Clinton's appointment, telling Signal FM that "Haiti will never fall under the protectorate of another country"
even if it is a "disguised protectorate." He further said that the "OAS will constantly watch to make sure that does not
happen" (26 May).

I talked with Mary Beth Sheridan. This is actually a pretty good story. The thrust of the piece is that there is a great deal
of concern about growing Iranian influence in Latin America — talk of investments, projects and so forth — but so far very
little has actually appeared. In other words, the Iranians are talking a good game but not delivering. It is within this
context that Mary Beth picked up on the comment by the Secretary of this large embassy in Manangua that
It turns out is not under construction, at least not yet.
On the record, I said that the Secretary picked this up from one of her counterparts from the region during a bilateral. If
it turns out that is not happening, that's good news. The Iranians see themselves as the big winners in the second Gulf
War. They are trying to extend their influence, particularly in their own region, but elsewhere where they see possible
openings. But while they are trying to buy friends and influence people around the world, the results are clearly mixed.
The story will probably run Sunday.

CONCEPT NOTE FOR WORLD FOOD PRIZE CEREMONY
Thursday, June 11, 2009
This speech is an opportunity to signal the urgency of the problem of global hunger; connect it to an array of
global issues, including economic development, health and education, expanding opportunity for women, and
political stability; and declare the Administration's commitment to tackling hunger at its roots, through effective
and efficient collaboration with an array of partners.
Additionally, your remarks can point to a shift from past approaches by emphasizing the need to support local
solutions and focus on long-term sustainability to help people feed themselves and reduce the need for
emergency assistance down the road.
The speech could be framed as follows:
THE PRIZE AND PRIZE-WINNER
You can begin by announcing the winner of the 2009 World Food Prize, Dr. Gebisa Ejeta. He has a remarkable
story: born in a mud hut in Ethiopia, he got his PhD from Purdue University in plant breeding and genetics and
developed strains of sorghum that are drought-tolerant, high-yield, and resistant to the Striga weed, which
devastates crops across Africa.
Outside the lab, he helped start the Sudanese commercial seed industry; developed systems to produce, certify,
and market hybrid seeds; and educated farmers about the use of fertilizers and soil and water conservation. And
he has trained and inspired the next generation of African agricultural scientists.
A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH: FROM LAB TO FARM TO MARKET TO TABLE
Dr. Ejeta's work reflects the breadth of this issue and the comprehensive approach needed to address it—one
that connects the labs where new seed technologies are developed.., the fields where small-scale farmers labor
to feed their families and make a living.., the markets where food is bought and sold... and the homes where
people get the nourishment they need to thrive.
In many places, that food chain is broken. One billion people worldwide woke up hungry this morning and will
go to sleep hungry tonight. Chronic hunger threatens health, while making it harder for people to work and
students to learn, which in turn stunts economic development. Last year's food riots demonstrated that when
food is scarce, political stability is threatened.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761859 Date: 06/30/2015
To date, the world's primary response to hunger has been to send emergency food aid. While this saves lives, it
is a short-term fix, and we need a long-term solution.
The Obama Administration is committed to leading in developing a new global approach. We will support the
creation of sustainable agricultural systems in appropriate regions around the world, to increase agricultural
productivity, create jobs, strengthen economies, and protect natural resources.
We will do this not by imposing one-size-fits-all solutions, but by assisting countries in carrying out individual
strategies that meet their needs—for example, through the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development
Plan. To facilitate coordination and share best practices, we will seek to convene donor governments,
multilateral institutions, NG0s, private companies, foundations, universities, and individuals.
THE ANCHORS OF OUR APPROACH
We've identified seven anchors that secure sustainable agriculture systems. These will guide our approach.
• Increase agricultural productivity by expanding access to quality seeds, fertilizer, irrigation, the credit to
purchase them, and the training to use them.
• Stimulate the post-harvest sector by improving the storage and processing of food and improving
transportation to connect small farmers to markets.
• Maintain natural resources so the land can be farmed well into the future and we can make the right
adaptations for the changing environment.
• Expand knowledge and training by support R&D and developing the next generation of agriculture
scientists.
• Increase trade so small-scale farmers in developing countries can sell their crops far and wide.
• Support policy reform and good governance, because sustainable agriculture flourishes in a clear and
predictable policy and regulatory environment.
• Support women and families in agriculture. Seventy percent of the world's farmers are women, but
most of the programs that offer credit and training to farmers target men. This must change for
agriculture to thrive. And children must have nutrition to contribute to their communities' future.
A PREVIEW OF WHAT'S TO COME
In the coming weeks, President Obama, Secretary Vilsack and I will be reaching out to share our approach to
global coordination and agriculture in greater detail. We will seek the input, wisdom and guidance of those who
have been working so long in this arena—from the Congress to NGOs to academics to foundations to the
private sector. The President's conversations at the G-8 meeting in Italy in two weeks will address our
approach, as well as my trip to Africa in August.
Addressing hunger and food is essential to achieving economic recovery, stabilizing societies, and expanding
opportunity for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. This is why supporting sustainable agriculture
worldwide will be a central element of foreign policy in the Obama Administration.
CONCLUSION
You can circle back to the story of Dr. Ejeta to close. He represents the need for a multinational
approach: born in Ethiopia, educated in the United States, advised by Indian scientists, advisor to several
African nations.

Dr. Ejeta's work reflects the breadth of this issue and the comprehensive approach needed to
address it—one that connects the labs where new seed technologies are developed.., the fields
where small-scale farmers labor to feed their families and make a living.., the markets where
food is bought and sold... and the homes where people get the nourishment they need to thrive.
In many places, that food chain is broken. One billion people worldwide woke up hungry this
morning and will go to sleep hungry tonight. Chronic hunger threatens health, while making it
harder for people to work and students to learn, which in turn stunts economic development.
Last year's food riots demonstrated that when food is scarce, political stability is threatened.
To date, the world's primary response to hunger has been to send emergency food aid. While
this saves lives, it is a short-term fix, and we need a long-term solution.

The Obama Administration is committed to leading in developing a new global approach. We
will support the creation of sustainable agricultural systems in appropriate regions around the
world, to increase agricultural productivity, create jobs, strengthen economies, and protect
natural resources.
We will do this not by imposing one-size-fits-all solutions, but by assisting countries in carrying
out individual strategies that meet their needs—for example, through the Comprehensive Africa
Agriculture Development Plan. To facilitate coordination and share best practices, we will seek
to convene donor governments, multilateral institutions, NG0s, private companies, foundations,
universities, and individuals.
THE ANCHORS OF OUR APPROACH
We've identified seven anchors that secure sustainable agriculture systems. These will guide our
approach.
• Increase agricultural productivity by expanding access to quality seeds, fertilizer,
irrigation, the credit to purchase them, and the training to use them.
• Stimulate the post-harvest sector by improving the storage and processing of food and
improving transportation to connect small farmers to markets.
• Maintain natural resources so the land can be farmed well into the future and we can
make the right adaptations for the changing environment.
• Expand knowledge and training by support R&D and developing the next generation of
agriculture scientists.
• Increase trade so small-scale farmers in developing countries can sell their crops far and
wide.
• Support policy reform and good governance, because sustainable agriculture flourishes in
a clear and predictable policy and regulatory environment.
• Support women and families in agriculture. Seventy percent of the world's farmers are
women, but most of the programs that offer credit and training to farmers target men.
This must change for agriculture to thrive. And children must have nutrition to
contribute to their communities' future.
A PREVIEW OF WHAT'S TO COME
In the coming weeks, President Obama, Secretary Vilsack and I will be reaching out to share our
approach to global coordination and agriculture in greater detail. We will seek the input, wisdom
and guidance of those who have been working so long in this arena—from the Congress to
NGOs to academics to foundations to the private sector. The President's conversations at the G-
8 meeting in Italy in two weeks will address our approach, as well as my trip to Africa in August.
Addressing hunger and food is essential to achieving economic recovery, stabilizing societies,
and expanding opportunity for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. This is why
supporting sustainable agriculture worldwide will be a central element of foreign policy in the
Obama Administration.

CONCEPT NOTE FOR WORLD FOOD PRIZE CEREMONY
Thursday, June 11, 2009
This speech is an opportunity to signal the urgency of the problem of global hunger; connect it to
an array of global issues, including economic development, health and education, expanding
opportunity for women, and political stability; and declare the Administration's commitment to
tackling hunger at its roots, through effective and efficient collaboration with an array of
partners.
Additionally, your remarks can point to a shift from past approaches by emphasizing the need to
support local solutions and focus on long-term sustainability to help people feed themselves and
reduce the need for emergency assistance down the road.
The speech could be framed as follows:
THE PRIZE AND PRIZE-WINNER
You can begin by announcing the winner of the 2009 World Food Prize, Dr. Gebisa Ejeta. He
has a remarkable story: born in a mud hut in Ethiopia, he got his PhD from Purdue University in
plant breeding and genetics and developed strains of sorghum that are drought-tolerant, high-
yield, and resistant to the Striga weed, which devastates crops across Africa.
Outside the lab, he helped start the Sudanese commercial seed industry; developed systems to
produce, certify, and market hybrid seeds; and educated farmers about the use of fertilizers and
soil and water conservation. And he has trained and inspired the next generation of African
agricultural scientists.
A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH: FROM LAB TO FARM TO MARKET TO TABLE
Dr. Ej eta's work reflects the breadth of this issue and the comprehensive approach needed to
address it—one that connects the labs where new seed technologies are developed.., the fields
where small-scale farmers labor to feed their families and make a living.., the markets where
food is bought and sold... and the homes where people get the nourishment they need to thrive.
In many places, that food chain is broken. One billion people worldwide woke up hungry this

The Uncommon Trustee
FROM ETHIOPIA TO L.A. WITH $150 IN HIS POCKET,
DANIEL YOHANNES BRINGS A
QUIET DETERMINATION TO HIS TRUSTEE ROLE.
By Leah Arroyo
This article was published in Museum, July/August 2008.
Trustee. The word brings to mind a venerable patrician of senior years, "trusted" to guide the interests of an organization or
individual with wisdom and perspective. Someone with old-boy or -girl connections, decades of expertise and, especially, big bucks—
not to mention the ability to pry others away from theirs. Ascot not required, but it couldn't hurt.
In certain ways, Daniel Yohannes of Denver is not your typical museum trustee. At 17, with $150, he moved from Ethiopia to Los
Angeles as an exchange student without knowing a soul. He immediately got a part-time job as a stock boy in a clothing store and
went on to support himself through high school, Claremont McKenna College and the MBA program at Pepperdine. He began his
banking career as a teller at Security Pacific Bank.
But in other ways, Yohannes is the very portrait of a board member. At 55, the president and CEO of M&R Investments, a firm
specializing in real estate, financial institutions and energy. A former vice chairman of U.S. Bancorp. A few years ago he started a
bank in San Francisco on the side. His board membership extends from the financial (a Fortune 100 company) and educational (U.C.
Denver Business School) to community organizations (the chamber of commerce, the National Jewish Hospital and Research Center,
the Boy Scouts Council)—not to mention political service (chairing the transition team of Gov. Bill Ritter, Democrat of Colorado).
And museums, a priority among the board invitations he has accepted. He served on the Smithsonian Institution's national board for
six years and is now a trustee of the Denver Art Museum (DAM), where he established the Daniel Yohannes Family African Gallery. "I
get a lot of my inspirations intellectually and culturally through art and history, primarily through museums," he says. "So when I
was asked to sit on the [DAM] board, it was just a natural fit for me."
For all his success, though, Yohannes hardly gives the impression of a Type-A personality. Courtly, soft-spoken, with a melodious
accent paying homage to his Ethiopian roots despite his decades in the U.S., he is generous and unhurried with his time in
interviews. On the phone, he asks how you are, what you've been up to lately; told that an interviewer just bought her first house,
he chats for a few moments about how delightful and meaningful that purchase is. In person, for a conversation at the AAM Annual
Meeting in Denver last spring, he walked into a rather dreary underground room in the convention center, suave in a conservative
navy suit and warm in his greetings, politely oblivious to the tables cluttered with the conference staff's walkie-talkies, office supplies
and assortment of snacks. The photographer got sent to the wrong room and his interviewer had to scurry the length of several
football fields to find her? No problem; he'd reserved plenty of time to talk. "Take your time."
And yet you can at times glimpse the calm determination of a man who gets things done and, moreover, fiAly expects to. Vicki
Sterling, the Denver Art Museum's assistant director, says that "what was truly unique about working with [Yohannes] on the African
gallery was his ability to bring together people from outside the regular museum donor community and get them interested in the
Denver Art Museum." When you ask him how he did this, who these new museophiles were, you can almost hear him shrug over the
phone. "Friends of mine, people I knew," he says. "They contributed because I asked them to." He also shrugs off the question of
how he fits all his commitments into his schedule: "I think as long as there's a desire to get everything done, it gets done." Asked
what he does for fun, he has to think for a moment. "That's a good one. . . . I walk, I play a little golf, do a little bicycling,
sightseeing." He also collects art, particularly African works, inspired years ago by his travels, though "only as a hobby." Last but not
least, he cherishes spending time with his three children, two of whom live in the area, and was overjoyed to become a grandfather
in May ("She's beautiful," he beams).

You walk away from him with an impression of a quietly dynamic man who has more priorities than most of us but can somehow
bring extraordinary focus to each in turn. He says he was driven from the very beginning. "It was my decision to come here, not my
family's. I've always been a very adventurous person, ever since I was a child, so I made a decision early on that I wanted to make
it on my own. I wanted to go to a place that provided that opportunity for someone like myself, an immigrant. I could not find any
other place but here in the United States that provided all of that opportunity." Perhaps later generations of his family will be more
jaded about the American dream, but Yohannes speaks of it with unembarrassed directness. "For someone like myself, it's much
easier to give to the community that has given you so much."
Fortunately, he sees museum leadership as part of that obligation.

Many thanks for the Tiananmen statement, which hit all they key points, and went a long way towards resolving any lingering
ambiguity from the Secretary's February comments. We believe it remains crucial to make such statements every year-or until such
time as the Chinese government allows for real resolution. We know these statements cause a certain amoint of diplomatic rancor, but
we hope that the comfort and courage they give people also remain part of your calculations.
May I trouble one of you to forward this message to Steve and Dan in Beijing, and to Carlos in DC? And please do feel free to share it

photographer got sent to the wrong room and his interviewer had to scurry the length of several football fields to find
her? No problem; he'd reserved plenty of time to talk. "Take your time."
And yet you can at times glimpse the calm determination of a man who gets things done and, moreover, fully expects to.
Vicki Sterling, the Denver Art Museum's assistant director, says that "what was truly unique about working with
[Yohannes] on the African gallery was his ability to bring together people from outside the regular museum donor
community and get them interested in the Denver Art Museum." When you ask him how he did this, who these new
museophiles were, you can almost hear him shrug over the phone. "Friends of mine, people I knew," he says. "They
contributed because I asked them to." He also shrugs off the question of how he fits all his commitments into his
schedule: "I think as long as there's a desire to get everything done, it gets done." Asked what he does for fun, he has to
think for a moment. "That's a good one.... I walk, I play a little golf, do a little bicycling, sightseeing." He also collects
art, particularly African works, inspired years ago by his travels, though "only as a hobby." Last but not least, he
cherishes spending time with his three children, two of whom live in the area, and was overjoyed to become a
grandfather in May ("She's beautiful," he beams).
You walk away from him with an impression of a quietly dynamic man who has more priorities than most of us but can
somehow bring extraordinary focus to each in turn. He says he was driven from the very beginning. "It was my decision
to come here, not my family's. I've always been a very adventurous person, ever since I was a child, so I made a decision
early on that I wanted to make it on my own. I wanted to go to a place that provided that opportunity for someone like
myself, an immigrant. I could not find any other place but here in the United States that provided all of that
opportunity." Perhaps later generations of his family will be more jaded about the American dream, but Yohannes
speaks of it with unembarrassed directness. "For someone like myself, it's much easier to give to the community that
has given you so much."
Fortunately, he sees museum leadership as part of that obligation.

Response:
James Kunder, Senior Fellow at the German Marshall Fund and
former Acting Deputy Administrator, U.S. Agency for International
Development
The United States is the largest national donor of foreign aid in the
world. It is engaged in two major wars, each of which require
improving local economic conditions to achieve success. And it
faces a variety of challenges around the world—from responding to
natural disasters to promoting democratic governance—that demand
effective responses.
Despite these circumstances, the United States does not have a
comprehensive, coherent strategy to guide its development assistance
programs. With the advent of a new administration, the time is ripe
to have a serious policy discussion about the merits of a National
Strategy for Global Development.
The Sustainable Security Program at the Center for American
Progress has written a National Strategy for Global Development,
which it hopes will spark debate. The authors of the document, Dr.
Reuben E. Brigety, II and Sabina Dewan, will discuss their proposal
for an NSGD at this event. They will be joined by Mr. James
Kunder, senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund and former
acting deputy administrator of the U.S. Agency for International
Development.

the beginning of a nice review from chicago tribune below... .(and it looks like she added some excellent
personal touches to the final remarks, if I'm not mistaken)....
"Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton held the infield today at the new Yankee Stadium. "Does it get
getter than this?" she asked her audience.
And the former senator from New York may have hit one out of the park, as the commencement speaker at
New York University's graduation, suggesting that everyone who had used their social networks to help elect
Barack Obama president should turn that e-power toward doing good for other people."

With respect to our interests, it went great. They had so many witnesses (five on a single panel) that Zelikow didn't get
that much play and the memo itself even less. Zelikow mentioned in his opening statement, matter of factly, that his memo
was located and that it was undergoing declassification review.
Senator Whitehouse didn't even mention that he had read the classified memo, and Coburn was in attendance but left
before he could ask any questions.

US Embassy Beijing "decapitated"
Thu, 05/14/2009 - 10:04am
Citing the desire to spend more time with his wife, the charge d'affaires of the U.S. embassy in Beijing,
Dan Piccuta, has announced his retirement, a notice issued to embassy employees and obtained by The
Cable says. Piccuta's departure will leave the embassy "decapitated" as of July 1, a source said. "If the
process for selecting an ambassador to Beijing wasn't in high gear before, we better hope it is now," the
official said. The U.S. embassy in Beijing will also need a formal, actual deputy chief of mission. One
possibility -- that Bill Weinstein, who has been the effective DCM in Beijing for four months now, would
be able to drop the "acting" title.
(The Cable previously reported that several people had turned down the Beijing ambassador job.)
Piccuta's retirement announcement here:

Subject: BROADCAST NOTICE: Dan Piccuta - Retirement
It seems to me that for some time now we have been living in a non-stop diplomatic highlights film.
I won't soon forget the thrill of supporting our US Olympic family, the President and other Americans
during the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympic Games. We can be proud to have safely and securely
consolidated employees at our beautiful new embassy where proximity to colleagues and techno wizardry
have catalyzed collaboration in our professional efforts. To that list we can now add our contributions to
the engagement with China of a new U.S. administration through mutual efforts to build a positive,
cooperative and comprehensive bilateral relationship. Your accomplishments are too numerous to mention
in more detail, but the depth, breadth and excellence of our agencies and posts in China are acclaimed as
without equal among U.S. diplomatic missions.
Just as important have been successes in improving work-life balance throughout the Mission, in
facilitating employment of our family members, and in promoting the sense of community and mutual
support among employees, sections, and agencies as well as with constituent and neighboring posts.
I am hopeful that some have noticed the effort to provide deserving officers, specialists, family members
and LES employees with opportunities for professional growth including in supervisory and leadership
roles. Because of the ever-increasing diversity and talent of our team, the exit of any one colleague has
never diluted our combined strength nor caused us or the Department concern. I am therefore confident
that we will manage the many transitions we'll address in the coming months with exceptional
competence and that we can count on each others' support as we prepare for new leadership throughout

this terrific Mission.
As many of you know, Christina has been preparing our Hawaii home since March. No future challenge or
incentive nor any measure of past success could fully repay two decades of sacrifice as a trailing
spouse. Reflecting on our experience, I have great empathy for colleagues who meet the tandem,
hardship and expeditionary demands of the military and our Foreign Service that require long periods of
separation from loved ones.
Mindful of all of the above, I have earlier today asked the Office of Retirement and the EAP Bureau to act
now on the retirement application I submitted for their review some months ago, and to initiate the formal
DCM selection process, as I prepare to join Christina on the Big Island and to retire from the Foreign
Service with effect from July 1.

Subject: 624,000 more hours of productivity at State
Cheryl/Jake:
We're going to forward with the doubling of mobile access to email and productivity tools. It's INSANE that
fewer than 1 in 5 state Department are able to access their email or documents when they're away from their
desk. It has contributed to the 9:00-5:00 culture here and exacerbates the disconnection between D.C. and the
missions. This is a good short-term win and by my estimates will produce new fewer than 624,000 more hours
of productivity by end of year one which I think is extremely conservative — it assumes just 1.5 additional hour
online per employee per week. Given that those being given the tools are principally foreign service officers
and people more senior than the mean average DoS employee, I think this is very reasonable. Will put an
evaluative instrument into this to see if I'm correct. More detail on all this below if you want it.
I should point out that Pat Kennedy and the CIO have been great. This has been one of several instances
where they listened, they got it, and they're moving forward. The CIO said she'd thought of it before, just
didn't know if she could handle the politics. I'm not going to spend a ton of time on our "corporate IT" but in
obvious cases like this I'll keep jumping in.
Last thing --- this idea got a lot of attention on The Sounding Board. I propose that HRC respond to the staff
(maybe in a quick 60 second video that we post there) saying in effect - Thank you for sharing your thinking. I
heard you. Because of you we're doing this.
Re-enforce that HRC is still listening to the staff.

our employees has gotten the device (fob) that allows you to do this access.
This effort is making sure they get fobs into the hands of more (or all) employees so folks can work from home thereby
increasing productivity substantially since the 4 in 5 essentially do no work from home once they leave the building until
they get in again b/c they don't have access to their email.

is a good short-term win and by my estimates will produce new fewer than 624,000 more hours of productivity by end
of year one which I think is extremely conservative - it assumes just 1.5 additional hour online per employee per week.
Given that those being given the tools are principally foreign service officers and people more senior than the mean
average DoS employee, I think this is very reasonable. Will put an evaluative instrument into this to see if I'm correct.
More detail on all this below if you want it.
I should point out that Pat Kennedy and the CIO have been great. This has been one of several instances where they
listened, they got it, and they're moving forward. The CIO said she'd thought of it before, just didn't know if she could
handle the politics. I'm not going to spend a ton of time on our "corporate IT" but in obvious cases like this I'll keep
jumping in.
Last thing --- this idea got a lot of attention on The Sounding Board. I propose that HRC respond to the staff (maybe in a
quick 60 second video that we post there) saying in effect - Thank you for sharing your thinking. I heard you. Because of
you we're doing this.
Re-enforce that HRC is still listening to the staff.

I met with Pat today and we did discuss expansion of the fob program. He is supportive and asked that we do a

Cheryl:
In anticipation of our meeting tomorrow, below and attached are a timeline and deliverables as we discussed
last week.
I am having a lot of fun. I'm working my tail off, which I enjoy. If demand is an indicator of performance, I think
I'm getting off to a strong start. I'm wound up about my concept of 21st century statecraft (and loved hearing
those words come out of HRC's mouth at NYU) and am wound up about the possibilities of government to
people and people to government communication as a way of revolutionizing statecraft and empowering
people across the globe. I think this can be a major part of HRC's legacy.
Anyway ... here's the requested content for your review:

sure -- bottom line - you need a special security code to get on line from a computer outside the building. Only 1 in 5 of
our employees has gotten the device (fob) that allows you to do this access.
This effort is making sure they get fobs into the hands of more (or all) employees so folks can work from home thereby
increasing productivity substantially since the 4 in 5 essentially do no work from home once they leave the building until
they get in again b/c they don't have access to their email.

Trip Report: Shanghai, Beijing, Seoul, Rome
Anne-Marie Slaughter
Shanghai: I was driven around the expo site and saw how far advanced the Chinese pavilion is, also the Canadian and
Brazilian pavilions that are facing and adjacent to us, and many spectacular European pavilions. In addition to the
overwhelming size and grandeur of the expo site as a whole — it will be like the New York World's Fair on steroids — what
struck me is that we must also hold up our end with the many visitors who will be coming from the Americas. The video
of the history of world expositions that plays in the Shanghai exposition building and will help open the expo itself is a
visual of rising American power — repeated expos in the 19th and 20th centuries in New York, Chicago, St. Louis, San
Francisco and other American cities. Expos are the soft power Olympics and hence a key part of smart power; we should
be willing to ask Congress for money and consider it extremely well spent in terms of building American power in the
world — and cheap at the price.
I also had several meals and meetings with members of what I am coming to think of as "the American diaspora" —
talented and entrepreneurial Chinese-Americans and Chinese raised/educated in America who have come back to China
to live on the economic frontier — and who are spreading American values with them. They gave a very optimistic picture
of the Chinese economy.
Beijing: I had dinner with "new media figures"
In my official meetings on the S&ED we made real progress, getting the Chinese to agree to a closed meeting just with
the four principals and getting them to agree to consider a model of a joint statement that we will now provide; I made
very clear that a joint statement was critical to getting results. Later in the day we had a breakthrough with the Deputy
Minister of Commerce, who agreed to working level meetings and concrete "bottom-up" joint projects on development
assistance. His staff agreed to meet w/ the AID person at our embassy for the first time — as the embassy said, clearly
the Chinese have decided to move forward w/ us on multiple fronts.

The most striking thing to emerge from many conversations with officials and academics in Shanghai and Beijing was
how often the G-2 was raised — always in the context of "we don't believe in the G-2, but ..." One official said "we can
just take away the 'G' and leave the '2.' I was at pains to emphasize that the U.S. has no interest in a G-2,

as Japan and China itself would never agree to a nuclear reunited Korea." Talks with my Japanese and Korean
yielded dgreement 1.4(B)
The Japanese raised and the Koreans welcomed the prospect of China-U.S.-Korea talks to match the new 1.4(D)
China-U.S.-Japan talks. Both the Koreans and the Japanese raised the idea of an "Asian G-8" — U.S., China, Japan, Russia, gi
Korea, Australia, India, and one other .." I raised the idea of convening the Asian members of the G-20 plus us, which
would include all those countries plus Indonesia.
Rome: I met with my G-8 counterparts over dinner and then w/ G-8 policy planners plus representatives from South
Africa, Mexico, Brazil, and Egypt. The G-8 discussion yielded strong agreement that responsibility for outcomes should be
a key determinant of who gets to sit at the table, although the Germans and Italians want to expand the core
"convening" group to at least the G-8 plus the Heiligendamm 5. Canada, France, Britain and Japan very much liked my
tentatively floated idea that each G-8 member be able to decide as host which other countries to invite as full members,
depending on the problem chosen as the focus of the agenda. Strikingly, did not even bother to send a Rome- B1
based representative to the talks the next day, underlining my point that some of these countries really are not ready 1.4(D)
for regular responsibility for global issues. The representative, a truly impressive director general in their
DFA, said was not pushing for a G-13, as it felt uncomfortable being anointed when so many African
countries were not represented. In the substantive discussion of Af-Pak and central Asia, the mbassador to
Rome emphasized that the Rio Group was taking a political position on Af-Pak as a sign of increasing hemispheric
engagement with the outside world.

In anticipation of our conversation later today, here are some thoughts in support of an appointment at State:
• I've been cleared by State Dept security for an ambassadorial-level position
• My resume (attached) shows good experience in numerous areas useful at State—and I'm known for being able
to get the job done
• I'm ready to go---right now; I can begin immediately to contribute
• No one can question my loyalty—I've had a lot of years of successfully making high ranking government officials
look good

Utah Governor to Become Ambassador to China
By Jeff Zeleny
Updated President Obama on Saturday selected one of the nation's leading Republican governors to serve as
the ambassador to China, nominating Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman for the diplomatic post that Mr. Obama called
"as important as any in the world."
"We will launch a new era of partnership between our two nations that will advance our shared dreams of
opportunity and security in America, in Asia and around the world," Mr. Obama said. "I can think of no more
important assignment than creating the kinds of bridges between our two countries that will determine the well
being not just of Americans and Chinese, but also the future of the world."
In a morning announcement at the White House, Mr. Huntsman stood at the president's side in the Diplomatic
Room and accepted the position that he said came as a surprise. As a co-chairman of Senator John McCain's
presidential campaign last year, Mr. Huntsman said he did not expect to be "called into action by the person
who beat us."
Mr. Huntsman, 49, learned to speak Mandarin Chinese from his days as a Mormon missionary in Taiwan. He
has worked in two Bush administrations, serving as the ambassador to Singapore in the final year of George
H.W. Bush's term and as a deputy United States trade ambassador for George W. Bush.
For Mr. Obama, whose advisers already have their eyes set on his re-election in 2012, the selection of Mr.
Huntsman is something of a political coup. He has emerged as one of the nation's most visible Republican
governors and was expected to at least consider seeking his party's presidential nomination to run against Mr.
Obama.
"In the breadth of issues at stake, this ambassadorship is as important as any in the world," Mr. Obama said. "I
believe there is much to be gained from a closer working relationship with China, but improved relationships
will require candor on issues in which we don't always agree."
As the Republican Party forges through a period of reinvention, Mr. Huntsman has been a leading voice for the
direction of the party. He has been a political moderate on issues like immigration, gay rights and the
environment, even though he represented one of the most conservative states in the country.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762241 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762241 Date: 06/30/2015
It was far from certain whether Mr. Huntsman would have actually sought the Republican presidential
nomination — his centrist views could have created a challenge in early-voting states — but if he is confirmed by
the Senate for the ambassadorship to China, he is part of the Obama team at a time when China is of critical
importance. And he is out of the mix in the 2012 presidential race.
"When the president of the United States asks you to step up and serve in a capacity like this, that to me is the
end of the conversation and the beginning of the obligation to rise to the challenge," said Mr. Huntsman, who
was joined by his wife Mary Kaye, and the couple's seven children, one of whom was adopted from China.
The courtship of Mr. Huntsman was overseen by the White House Chief of Staff, Ralun Emanuel, who met with
him last Saturday when the governor was in town for the White House Correspondent's dinner. Mr. Obama also
spoke to Mr. Huntsman, aides said, and was impressed by his experience and views on China.
"Governor Huntsman has respect for China's proud traditions," Mr. Obama said Saturday. "He understands
what it will take to make America more competitive in the 21st century and will be an unstinting advocate for
America's interests and ideals."
The nomination of Mr. Huntsman is the latest in a series of high-level Republican appointments in the Obama
administration. The president selected two Republicans to serve in his Cabinet, but aides said he was frustrated
when a third choice, Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, withdrew his nomination as
Commerce Secretary.
Mr. Huntsman, who was elected to his second term of governor last year, intends to step down if he is
confirmed by the Senate.
"I hope the good people of Utah will forgive me and understand how proud they should be of their governor for
his willingness to serve," Mr. Obama said. "He always puts country ahead of himself. That's what Jon has
always done."

unique fellow in some respects, he is a serious and thoughtful person and obviously knows the issues of the hemisphere

I don't want to be too strong in my recommendation or involve myself inappropriately in your and the Secretary's
decision making regarding personnel, is a person of real accomplishment and has a standing that is
similar to Senator Mitchell, Richard Holbrooke and Dennis Ross. Of course as someone dedicated to hemispheric affairs
I would certainly like to see the Special Envoy to the region be a person of distinction and recognized accomplishment.
Please call me as soon as you can on this one. I think it's quite an important development, as I noted, and would like to
have a brief conversation about it with you and perhaps the Secretary.
As always thank you for your consideration.
Personally,

PS Secretary Clinton was superb in her interview with George Stephanopoulos, although I must admit I don't remember

Secretary Clinton's remarks at her Friday press conference with the Turkish Foreign Minister continued this
Administration's excellent efforts to restore the credibility of the U.S. with Greece and Cyprus — which will lead to
important progress in the region.
As you know, the Bush Administration consistently hid and defended actions by Turkey that were injurious to Cyprus and
Greece, inconsistent with American values and principals, and also not in Turkey's best interests.
We highlighted for the top leaders in our community that Secretary Clinton once again in front of the Turkish Foreign
Minister, called for a "bi-zonal and bi-communal federation" for Cyprus as well as expressed the United States' strong
support for "freedom of religion."
With Secretary Clinton and others doing these kinds of things, America is moving to correct the biggest road block to a
Cyprus settlement — restoring American credibility with the Greek-Cypriots which was badly lost during the Bush
Administration.
Keep up the great work!

Remarks With Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu
Hillary Rodham Clinton
Secretary of State
Treaty Room
Washington, DC
June 5, 2009
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon. Minister Davutoglu and I just had a very productive, broad-ranging, comprehensive
discussion. And it is a great privilege to welcome him here to the State Department within the very first weeks of his having been
appointed foreign minister. Of course, I was very honored to have gone to Turkey very early in my term as Secretary of State, and
President Obama had a wonderful visit to Turkey.
And all of that is to confirm the strength and importance of our partnership and alliance. We have a lot of work to do together. Turkey,
the United States, and the entire global community certainly face a great number of challenges, but we also see opportunities. So our
message coming out of the meeting today and our prior meetings is that we're going to deepen and strengthen our cooperation on an
ongoing basis, because we believe that both Turkey and the United States have unique roles to play.

Now, we obviously already collaborate. Not only are we both members of NATO, but we are working with the G-20 to respond to the
global economic crisis, we're exploring ways to enhance our trade and commerce between our two countries, we're working to develop
new energy sources, including resources from the Caucasus and Central Asia. We're partners in the fight against global terrorism. We
share the goal of a stable Pakistan and Afghanistan, and to deny al-Qaida safe haven that can threaten our countries and many others.
We support Turkey in its fight against the terrorist activities of the PKK, which has been a very important cooperation.
And I underscored again today the United States' strong support for Turkey's bid to become a member of the European Union. Turkey
has made significant progress toward membership. It's been in a process of reform that is generated by its own internal decisions but
which has certainly responded to many of the concerns regarding the strength of the bid that Turkey had. And so we applaud what
Turkey has already done and pledge our efforts to continue working with Turkey.
And so we ranged across a broad number of issues, and I want to just make a special note. As President Obama said yesterday in
Cairo, the United States is committed to broad engagement with Muslims everywhere across the globe based on mutual interests and
mutual respect. We believe strongly in the freedom of religion and expression, in vibrant civil societies, and we know that
those are values that Turkey shares.
And I want to thank the minister and his government for the role that Turkey plays as a force for peace and stability. This is important,
and it's already been demonstrated in the work that Turkey has done for a number of years and continues with respect to
comprehensive peace in the Middle East. And we are strongly supportive of the Turkish efforts to normalize relations with Armenia, and
we are also very strongly supportive of the efforts to resolve the Nagomo-Karabakh conflict.
We discussed Cyprus, which is an issue that the President also addressed when he was in Turkey in April. The two Cypriot leaders
have an opportunity through their commitment to negotiations under the United Nations Good Offices Missions, and the United States is
willina to help the parties. We want to work toward a settlement that reunifies Cyprus into a bi-zonal and bi-communal federation.
We discussed many, many concerns, and I'm just grateful for the commitment by the minister and by his government to play an active
role in our dynamic world. Our relationship is not just about security; it is about seizing these opportunities, and I look forward to
working with you.

• Dennis Ross, who most recently served as a special State Department envoy to Iran, will abruptly be relieved of his
duties, sources in Washington told Haaretz. An official announcement is expected in the coming days.
The Obama administration will announce that Ross has been reassigned to another position in the White House. In his
new post, the former Mideast peace envoy under President Bill Clinton will deal primarily with regional issues related to
the peace process.
Washington insiders speculate that a number of reasons moved the administration to reassign Ross. One possibility is
Iran's persistent refusal to accept Ross as a U.S. emissary given the diplomat's Jewish background as well as his
purported pro-Israel leanings. Ross is known to maintain contacts with numerous senior officials in Israel's defense
establishment and the Israeli government.

Diplomatic sources in Jerusalem surmised that another possibility for Ross' ouster is his just-released book, "Myths,
Illusions, and Peace - Finding a New Direction for America in the Middle East."
Ross, who co-wrote the book with David Makovsky, a former journalist who is a fellow at the Washington Institute for
Near East Policy, argued against a linkage between the Palestinian issue and the West's policy against Iran's nuclear
ambitions.
Ross and Mokovsky also raised the possibility of military action against Iran.
"Tougher policies - either militarily or meaningful containment - will be easier to sell internationally and domestically if
we have diplomatically tried to resolve our differences with Iran in a serious and credible fashion," they wrote.
Another possible reason for the reshuffle could be Ross' dissatisfaction with his present standing in the State
Department, particularly given the fact that Washington's two other envoys to the region - George Mitchell, who is
overseeing the Mideast peace process; and Richard Holbrooke, who is dealing with Pakistan and Afghanistan - wield
great influence and are featured prominently.
A diplomatic source in Jerusalem speculated that perhaps Ross preferred to work for the National Security Agency,
which answers directly to President Barack Obama, and would thus be considered a more enhanced role.
Last year, Ross was an advisor to Obama's successful presidential campaign. Before Obama's inauguration, speculation
was rampant as to which job Ross would assume in the new administration.
On February 24, 2009, he was officially appointed as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's advisor on the Persian Gulf and
special envoy to Iran.

Cheryl
We are gathering info on the memo on the participation agreement which I will have up to you soon. It has taken a bit
to get the right people to answer the specific questions you asked about previous agreements.
In regard to the plan memo, we will have a more detailed plan for you tomorrow. We have been waiting for the
recommendations of the new structural group that was set up in NYC last Friday afternoon (Lanny, the Chamber of
Commerce, the Committee of 100, and others). We are getting a de-brief on their plans and new structure tomorrow.
In our calls to GE's Jeff Immelt, the Chamber, and others we learned that it would not be viable to get 20 CEO's into
Washington with such short notice. The Secretary called us in last Friday and said that she was game for doing some
additional calls which everyone in the business community thinks is a more efficient way to get this done. We are
holding a meeting on Friday with the business community (up to 75 Washington reps) and would follow it up with
individual assignments. We could still build an event with CEOs around late July Strategic Dialogue.
We will get you a more detailed plan with all of the potential events and assignments.

Twitter delays down time to aid Iranian protesters
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department contacted the social networking service Twitter over
the weekend to urge it to delay a planned upgrade that could have cut daytime service to Iranians, a U.S.
official said on Tuesday.
"We highlighted to them that this was an important form of communication," said the official of the
conversation the department had with Twitter at the time of the disputed Iranian election. He declined
further details.

REMARKS BY PRESIDENT OBAMA
AND PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI OF ITALY
IN PRESS AVAILABILITY
Oval Office
5:48 P.M. EDT
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Good evening, everybody. Buona sera. I want to
welcome Prime Minister Berlusconi here. He has proved to be a great
friend of the United States. And he and I got to know each other at the
G20 summit. We are now in the process of planning the G8 summit that
Italy will be hosting. We emphasized the strong, historic ties between
the United States and Italy. Our bilateral relationship has been marked
by cooperation across the board. And I am extremely grateful for his
friendship.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762382 Date: 06/30/2015
Just a couple of things that we specifically discussed. First of
all, I thanked the Prime Minister for his support of our policy of closing
Guantanamo. This is not just talk. Italy has agreed to accept three
specific detainees, and has also been part of the leadership in Europe
that today announced a framework in which European nations can accept
detainees. And that was something that I was very appreciative of. It
will give us an opportunity to create a lasting and durable international
legal framework for dealing with terrorism that I think is very important
on both sides of the Atlantic.
We discussed Afghanistan and Pakistan, where Italy has been a
critical part of the coalition that is trying to assist Afghanistan in
stabilizing itself and ensuring that it's not a safe haven for
terrorism. We had an extensive discussion about my interest in pursuing
nonproliferation as an important agenda for all people. And given that
I'll be visiting Russia before I visit Italy for the G8, Prime Minister
Berlusconi, who has strong relationships with the Russians, was able to
offer some insight in terms of how to approach reductions in nuclear
arsenals. And that hopefully is going to be a topic at the G8 summit, as
well.
And in addition to discussing the general situation in the world
economy, which obviously will be a central topic of the G8, we also
discussed specifically the issue of food security and how G8 nations can
assist people who are in most desperate poverty to ensure that they're not
slipping into hunger and further poverty. And that is going to be a major
topic of the G8 summit. And so I'm very appreciative of the leadership
that Prime Minister Berlusconi has shown on that front.
So overall I am very grateful to Prime Minister Berlusconi's
leadership, his consistent friendship towards the United States. We have
some of the strongest bilateral relations in the world. I am confident
that that will continue as long as both of us are occupying our positions.
And so thank you very much for taking the time to visit.
PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI: (As translated.) First of all, I would
like to thank President Obama for his welcome and for the possibility
offered us to provide our perspective, our opinions on many of the most
difficult and hardest issues at the international level. And we've
discussed, as he already briefed you, many of the issues and the topics,
and we went through in a detailed manner the three days of the G8
summit. We want this G8 to reach concrete solutions. And we want to
reach concrete solutions on many extremely important issues.
Clearly, the first issue is the world economy, the economic crisis
and how to get out of this crisis. And we also discussed the work that
our ministers of economy are carrying out right now to try and develop a
body of principles and to prevent similar situations from happening,
similar situations to the one we are experiencing right now.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762382 Date: 06/30/2015
We both agreed on the fact that the G8 will certainly not be able to
produce this body of rules, but this is going to be just one of the steps
leading to that drafting of rules. There will be then the G20 summit in
Pittsburgh, which will work on it, but the hope is to finally reach a body
of rules which can be shared by everybody which -- which are not going to
affect or hinder the free expansion of the economy and trade.
And we discussed two important issues. One of them, which will be
discussed in L'Aquila as well, is food security, as President Obama has
already said. We hope that the countries there will make concrete efforts
and concrete proposals. The United States has already promised to
increase the aid to other countries and they're going to make in the next
three years huge amounts of money available. We try and will push the
other countries in the G8, trying to persuade them to do the same.
And another important issue is that of climate change. And another
important achievement we are aiming at is to reduce CO2 emissions --
something, however, which has to be contributed to by all countries and
not only a limited number of them. And since the Doha Round has reached a
stop, we hope that by inviting Lamy, who is the director of the WTO, to
attend the G8 summit, that we can try and give another push to the Doha
Round, hoping to achieve positive results.
Probably what I forgot to mention up to now is that the meeting in
L'Aquila is not going to be confined to the G8 countries. The next day,
the second day, will be G8-plus-6. The major economies of the world will
be there; India, China, South Africa, Mexico, Brazil, and Egypt will
attend the second day of meetings. There will be the major economies
forum with the participation of South Korea, Indonesia, and Australia, and
then there is another meeting which will be attended also by the
Netherlands, Spain, and Denmark -- and we are going to have before all of
these meetings together.
The dinner will be attended also by the representatives of the main
international organizations. And the third day, we are going to have the
President of the African Union, the representatives of the main African
organizations, together with the representatives of some of the main
African countries. We are going to discuss the development of this
continent and the issue of hunger in that area.
And I can't but thank President Obama and express my warmest felt
appreciation to him for -- and this position is coming from a person
that's been long enough in international politics to chair for the third
time the G8 summit; the first one was in the 1994; the second one in 2001;
and now the third one -- I want to express my appreciation for his deep
knowledge and precision and accuracy with which he discusses all of the
issues.
And the positions that he expresses are not only innovative positions
looking at a different future, but they're always very concrete and
absolutely based on common sense. And it is extremely comforting and a

pleasure to see that the destiny of the biggest democracy in the world is
in very good hands.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: I hope my staff all caught
that. (Laughter.) Gibbs, write that down. (Laughter.)
Let me call on a couple people. Steve Thomma, McClatchy. There you
are.
Mr. President, on Iran, does the disputed election results
affect -- there's been violence in the street -- in any way change your
willingness to meet with Mr. Ahmadinejad without preconditions? And also,
do you have anything to say, any message to send to people who are on the
streets protesting, who believe their votes were stolen and who are being
attacked violently?
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Obviously all of us have been watching the news
from Iran. And I want to start off by being very clear that it is up to
Iranians to make decisions about who Iran's leaders will be; that we
respect Iranian sovereignty and want to avoid the United States being the
issue inside of Iran, which sometimes the United States can be a handy
political football -- or discussions with the United States.
Having said all that, I am deeply troubled by the violence that I've
been seeing on television. I think that the democratic process -- free
speech, the ability of people to peacefully dissent -- all those are
universal values and need to be respected. And whenever I see violence
perpetrated on people who are peacefully dissenting, and whenever the
American people see that, I think they're, rightfully, troubled.
My understanding is, is that the Iranian government says that they
are going to look into irregularities that have taken place. We weren't
on the ground, we did not have observers there, we did not have
international observers on hand, so I can't state definitively one way or
another what happened with respect to the election. But what I can say is
that there appears to ba a sense on the part of people who were so hopeful
and so engaged and so committed to democracy who now feel betrayed. And I
think it's important that, moving forward, whatever investigations take
place are done in a way that is not resulting in bloodshed and is not
resulting in people being stifled in expressing their views.
Now, with respect to the United States and our interactions with
Iran, I've always believed that as odious as I consider some of President
Ahmadinejad's statements, as deep as the differences that exist between
the United States and Iran on a range of core issues, that the use of
tough, hard-headed diplomacy -- diplomacy with no illusions about Iran and
the nature of the differences between our two countries -- is critical
when it comes to pursuing a core set of our national security interests,
specifically, making sure that we are not seeing a nuclear arms race in
the Middle East triggered by Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon; making sure
that Iran is not exporting terrorist activity. Those are core interests
not just to the United States but I think to a peaceful world in general.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762382 Date: 06/30/2015
We will continue to pursue a tough, direct dialogue between our two
countries, and we'll see where it takes us. But even as we do so, I think
it would be wrong for me to be silent about what we've seen on the
television over the last few days. And what I would say to those people
who put so much hope and energy and optimism into the political process, I
would say to them that the world is watching and inspired by their
participation, regardless of what the ultimate outcome of the election
was. And they should know that the world is watching.
And particularly to the youth of Iran, I want them to know that we in
the United States do not want to make any decisions for the Iranians, but
we do believe that the Iranian people and their voices should be heard and
respected.
PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI: ANSA.
(As translated.) President Obama, after this meeting with Prime
Minister Berlusconi, what do you expect, in concrete terms, from the
relationship between United States and Italy? And to Prime Minister
Berlusconi, you had very strong relations with President George W.
Bush. Do you expect and do you hope to build the same type of relations
with President Obama, as well?
PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI: I took an oath of gratitude towards
United States, which gave me freedom and which gave my country dignity
after World War II. So I'm here to cooperate with the President of the
United States. I'm here to cooperate with President Obama, as I
cooperated with President Clinton and as I did with President Bush.
So if I can express a hope, I really hope we can build a direct and
friendly relationship with President Obama. I would be more than happy to
do so. And facts will tell.
But anyway, I think we had a good start.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Absolutely. We've had a very good start. What I
expect from the Prime Minister is an honest, frank sharing of views and a
recognition that the United States and Italy share common values, common
interests. Our economies have very strong commercial ties. And if we're
acting on those mutual interests, then I have no doubt that we'll continue
to see strong cooperation.
As I said before, Prime Minister Berlusconi's assistance on our
efforts to close Guantanamo is very important to us. I have to say, by
the way, that Bermuda has done us a great service, as well, on that front,
and I'm grateful to them.
When it comes to Afghanistan and Pakistan, we are part of the same
coalition that wants to make sure that the Afghan government is able and
strong to sustain development for the Afghan people, but also to make sure
that they're not serving as a safe haven for extremists.

When it comes to the world economy, I think all of us have an
interest in improving the kinds of financial regulations that will prevent
the kinds of crises that we saw happening most recently.
So, across the board, I think we have a host of common interests. In
addition to liking Prime Minister Berlusconi personally, our peoples like
each other and recognize that we have shared interests. And that, I
think, will make the path for continued cooperation that much easier.
(After translation.) I must say, my answers sound very elegant in
Italian. (Laughter.)
Steve Collinson.
Thank you, Mr. President. Of the conditions that Prime Minister
Netanyahu laid out yesterday for a Palestinian state, the basis for
negotiation, do you think they will likely prove a stumbling block, given
the broadly negative reaction from the Arab states and the Palestinians?
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, first of all, I think it's important not to
immediately assess the situation based on commentary the day after a
speech. I think any time an Israeli Prime Minister makes a statement, the
immediate reaction tends to be negative on one side. If the other side is
making a statement, oftentimes the reaction is negative in Israel.
Overall, I thought that there was positive movement in the Prime
Minister's speech. He acknowledged the need for two states. There were a
lot of conditions, and obviously working through the conditions on
Israel's side for security, as well as the Palestinian side for
sovereignty and territorial integrity and the capacity to have a
functioning, prosperous state, that's exactly what negotiations are
supposed to be about. But what we're seeing is at least the possibility
that we can restart serious talks.
Now, I've been very clear that, from the United States' perspective,
Israel's security is non-negotiable. We will stand behind their
defense. I've also made very clear that both sides are going to have to
move in some politically difficult ways in order to achieve what is going
to be in the long-term interests of the Israelis and the Palestinians and
the international community.
On the Israeli side, that means a cessation of settlements. And
there is a tendency to try to parse exactly what this means, but I think
the parties on the ground understand that if you have a continuation of
settlements that, in past agreements, have been categorized as illegal,
that's going to be an impediment to progress. On the Palestinian side,
whether it's the Palestinian Authority or other groups like Hamas that
claim to speak for the Palestinians, a recognition of the Quartet
principles, ensuring that there's a recognition of Israel's right to
exist, making sure that past agreements are abided to, that there's an end

to incitement against Israel and an end to violence against Israel. Those
are necessary pillars of any serious agreement that's to be reached.
And those pillars have to be supported by the Arab states, because
Israel's security concerns extend beyond simply the Palestinian
Territories; they extend to concerns that they have in a whole host of
neighbors where there's perceived and often real hostility towards
Israel's security. So I'm glad that Prime Minister Netanyahu made the
speech. The United States will continue to try to be as honest as
possible to all sides in this dispute to indicate the degree to which it's
in everybody's interests to move in a new direction. And I think it can
be accomplished, but it's going to require a lot of work and a partnership
with key countries like Italy in order to help the parties come together
and recognize their own interests.
You discussed during the meeting the crisis, the economic
crisis, you're going to discuss at the G8. The package of measures you
are discussing right now, can this be a kind of basis for the next
meetings -- G8 and G20?
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, our respective finance ministers, not just
Italy's and the United States', but all the G8 members', have been meeting
diligently. They've put forward a framework that will be discussed and
hopefully ratified at the G8. That will provide a broad set of
principles.
Now, the United States is putting forward some very specific
regulatory reforms that are going to make sure that we don't find
ourselves in this position again, that improves oversight, ensures that
banks aren't taking risks with highly leveraged money that can result in
systemic collapse, that consumers and investors are protected more
effectively.
So we're going to have a lot of work to do. It's going to be a big,
complex piece of legislation. Different countries are going to have
different needs. Prime Minister Berlusconi was indicating to me that the
banking system in Italy has not been under the same kinds of pressures as
the banking system in the United States and some other European countries.
But I think the general principle -- that we're going to have
improved oversight, better practices, and that there's some coordination
and information-sharing between countries on issues like tax havens, for
example, so that you don't have global capital avoiding more stringent
rules by going to countries with weaker rules -- I think that's going to
be something that all G8 members affirm, and we very much appreciate Prime
Minister Berlusconi's leadership on this issue.
PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI: I would like to add to this that our
ministers of finance have been working on all of these issues and
packages. In particular they paid attention, for instance, to corporate
governments and rules for transparency and a regulation of the financial
sectors, accounting rules, and as President Obama has also mentioned,

also, the issue of tax havens, to try and prevent those situations from
happening again. And the idea is to work out a set of rules and
regulations which can prevent situations and conditions like the ones
we've experienced which have led -- from happening, experience that is to
-- which led first to the financial crisis and then to the economic crisis
that we are experiencing right now.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Thank you. Grazie.

More Gay Donors Drop Out of DNC Fundraiser, Protesting Justice Department Brief
June 18, 2009 2:30 PM
"This is not appropriate time" for the Democratic party to be hitting up gays and lesbians for money, says
Richard Socarides, a former Special Assistant to President Clinton, who's not attending next week's lesbian,
gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee.
Socarides tells ABC News that many members of the LGBT community are troubled by a brief filed by
President Obama's Justice Department last week that argued. — too vociferously, many believe — against
same sex marriage.
"The brief was very troubling to a lot of people and rightfully so," Socarides says. "Supporters of the
Democratic party and others who feel that gay and lesbian equality is an important issue for this administration
to address are rightly concerned about this brief. Serious issues still need clarification."
Socarides says that even though President Obama yesterday signed a presidential memorandum extending
some benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees, he was also aware of what the President did not do.
"The president did not last night address what direction he would give the Justice Department when these issues
come up in the future, he did not address the continued discharges of gay people from the military."
Socarides is just the latest in a list of prominent gay and lesbian Democrats withdrawing their
support from the DNC event. Others include David Mixner, another former adviser to President Clinton; Andy
Towle; and Alan Van Capelle, executive director of the Empire State Pride Agenda and Foundation.
And you can, as John Aravosis notes, add Vermont state senate president pro tern Peter Shumlin to the list of
prominent gay and lesbian Democrats who will not be attending.
"One thing I have learned dealing with marriage equality in Vermont is that we all have a responsibility to stand
up for the civil rights of all Americans," Shumlin said yesterday, according to the Times-Argus. "This
memo from the Justice Department is more Bush than Bush. It takes the only minority group left in America
that national politicians can publicly discriminate against and still see their numbers go up in the polls and it
reinforces the horrible stereotypes about our friends and neighbors."
And add gay Democratic donor Bruce Bastian, who told the Washington Blade he "will continue to support
certain congressmen, congresswomen and senators whom I believe will continue to fight for our rights, but I

don't think blanket donations to the Democratic Party right now are justified, at least not in my book." He said
he found the filing "very offensive."
"The administration has said they have to support the federal government's stance," he said. "But in the brief,
they go way beyond where they need to go to just defend DOMA. They basically go to terminology and
language that you would expect from the Bush administration, not the Obama administration."
Others include National Gal, and Lesbian Task Force executive director Rea Carey who decried "the
malicious and outrageous arguments and language used in the Department of Justice's marriage brief are only
serving to inflame and malign the humanity of same-sex couples and our families," and the Human Rights
Campaign's national field director Marty Rouse, who told the Blade that he "like many people, personally
offended by the words used in the [Justice Department] brief to defend DOMA. And I just can't see right now
attending a fundraiser for the DNC at this time."

pick for Protocol Post Corrects Failure to File Taxes in 2
Years
By ALISON LEIGH COWAN
The New York Times
June 19,2009
President Obama's choice as chief of protocol for the State Department, a position that carries the
status of an ambassadorship, did not file tax returns for 2005 and 2006, errors she corrected last
November.
The nominee, Capricia Penavic Marshall, has placed blame for the problem on the Postal Service and
on miscommunication between her husband and their accountant.
Ms. Marshall, who was a social secretary in the Clinton White House, notified the Obama
administration about the late filings before she was nominated on May 14. She has since provided
written answers to questions about the matter from Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, the top
Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, which will hold a hearing on the appointment next
Wednesday. The post requires Senate confirmation.
Tax issues have bedeviled several high-level Obama appointees and cost the administration at least
two of its picks.

Ms. Marshall, a graduate of Case Western Reserve University School of Law, may fare better because,
after ultimately filing the 2005 and 2006 federal and local paperwork, she was entitled to $37,259 in
refunds, according to information she provided to Mr. Lugar.
The nominee and her husband, Dr. Robert Marshall, a Washington cardiologist, did not return calls
seeking comment, nor did a White House spokesman.
Besides the president's support, Ms. Marshall appears to enjoy the strong endorsement of Secretary of
State Hillary Rodham Clinton and former President Bill Clinton. Ms. Marshall worked on their
campaigns and was most recently executive director of Mrs. Clinton's political action committee,
Hillpac.
In her written answers and in accounts she gave to government officials, Ms. Marshall has said the
errors were inadvertent. She has said that her husband failed to recognize that the couple's
accountant had included the tax returns for 2005 in a binder he provided with copies of the returns,
and that the actual paperwork was never mailed.
The couple learned something was awry, Ms. Marshall has said, when the Internal Revenue Service
notified them last fall that their 2006 return had never arrived. She wrote that an agent "advised us
that there were a large number of tax returns misplaced by the D.C. post office for the 2006 tax year."
That call led the couple to the discovery that the authorities had no record of their returns for 2005
and 2006. No late fees or penalties were assessed when they later submitted the returns.
The protocol chief customarily helps plan events for visiting leaders and helps oversee protocol
matters for the president and vice president abroad.

Elise Labott
CNN State Department Producer
Yesterday's groundbreaking move by President Obama to provide some benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees came to
fruition in large part due to Secretary of Clinton, who first put the issue on the table.
It is unclear whether the Obama administration came to office planning to offer government-wide benefits to domestic partners of civil
service employees, but Clinton, a longtime advocate of gay rights, was on it day one. Since President Obama named her as his pick for
Secretary of State in November, Clinton's transition staff and the State Department had been working with members of the American
Foreign Service Association and the group GLIFAA (Gays & Lesbians in Foreign Affairs Agencies) on what could be done to extend
benefits to domestic partners of diplomats serving abroad.
At her very first senior staff meeting Clinton instructed the State Department to review whether she had the authority to extend
benefits to same-sex domestic partners. About a week later a gay employee asked Clinton during a town hall with employees to
eliminate discrimination against same sex partners. The Secretary of State drew loud applause when she said the issue was "of real
concern" to her, and that she was already working on it.
Several weeks ago, a memo to employees from Clinton instituting the changes was leaked to the press. Clinton's aides at the time said
the memo was a draft, and that Clinton couldn't change policies without an "interagency review" of the issue to make sure State
Department actions wouldn't negatively affect other agencies. But the memo seemed to light a fire under the administration, which
quickly caught up to Clinton's lead.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762432 Date: 06/30/2015
Still, the health benefits announced Wednesday for same sex partners of non-State Department civil employees is a drop in the bucket
compared to the long list of other benefits the State Department extended to the gay partners of US diplomats serving abroad. In
addition to health benefits and access to medical and emergency evacuation, domestic partners will also get diplomatic passports,
training at the Foreign Service Institute and housing allowances. Same sex partners will get the same preference for US embassy jobs
that spouses currently enjoy, and the State Department will now work with foreign governments to provide same-sex domestic
partners, to the extent possible, with diplomatic visas, work permits and other privileges, including diplomatic immunity. The State
Department will even pay for them to fly home if a relative is gravely ill. Few of these benefits are currently offered to domestic
partners.
Although the Foreign Service has difference rules and regulations which allow the State Department to do more in the first place,
Clinton extended the full range of legally available benefits and allowances to same sex partners of members of the Foreign Service.
In a statement issued Thursday acknowledging the support partners provide to overseas posts, Clinton said, "domestic partners of
federal employees have for too long been treated unequally."
Clinton knows the move is also good business. Today's US diplomats serving around the world are increasingly having to shed their
pinstripe suits and get dirty in the field, which requires a whole different skill set. These days the State Department is competing for
the same Arabic and Farsi speakers and technology gurus as top notch multinational companies, where domestic partner benefits and
allowances are increasingly the norm. Clinton herself noted if the State Department wants to remain a "word class employer" which
attracts and retains high caliber personnel, the change is "the smart thing to do."

Also wanted to give you an update on ECA. Following up on our conversation over the weekend and as per your
direction I have had a number of good conversations with the ECA team including Mara. Happy to report we are all on
the same page with the career folks fully endorsing the plan. Details as follows:
• Grantee has been sanctioned
• IG is conducting investigation of grantee
• No further grants will be awarded to grantee pending outcome of IG investigation; probable outcome will be
delisting of grantee
• Working with Pat Kennedy to develop plan for spot checks of all grantees and random student checks
using existing Department resources
The IG investigation started today and as you predicted more information came out in the first meeting which led Miller
to request a full investigation of the Youth Services Program which I agreed to.
Pi did the CNN interview this a.m. No doubt it will be a tough story but according to Miller it was an honest discussion.
Have been keeping Casey's office in the loop and I plan to visit him personally. In the meantime I would like to move as
soon as possible to put someone into the A/S position on an acting basis. Do you have anyone in mind or would you like
me to make some suggestions?

Subject: Stanford Law Connection
Hi Cheryl. You may not remember me, but we were at Stanford together. I saw a statement from you on
CNN.com regarding Secretary Clinton's fractured elbow, so I went to our global address list, and voila—there
you are! You were a year or two ahead of me (I was class of 1991), but I distinctly remember being in Crim
Pro with you when the inimitable Barbara Babcock talked about your "friend" Wynton Marsalis being stopped
by the police!
Congratulations on your current position. You are really doing Stanford proud—I was watching the Clinton
impeachment hearings with friends when you were testifying and shouted, "Oh my God—I went to law school
with her!"
I can't tell you how thrilled we in the field are to have an administration we can be proud of again (I came in
during Bill Clinton's presidency, and it has been a rough eight years). As you may be learning, Foreign Service
Officers are overwhelmingly liberal democrats. At my post of 20 American officers, there are only two avowed
republicans (although there may be a few closet cases). We all watched the election returns together, and we
cheered, cried and hugged when Mr. Obama was announced the winner. Obviously, we are also thrilled to
have Hillary as our new Secretary of State.
I tried to write Secretary Clinton a message when she first announced benefits for same-sex partners
expressing my extreme gratitude. I have been with my partner for the last 14 years, and he has basically given
up his career to follow me around the world. It has been challenging but we've managed to survive. Below is
my original message, which I doubt Secretary Clinton ever actually received:

I'm not sure whether this message will ever find its way to Secretary Clinton, but I would like to convey my deep gratitude
for her courage in extending benefits to same-sex partners of Foreign Service Officers. I would also like to share how her
decision has literally changed the course of my career.
I had decided long ago to retire in 2014 after twenty years of service. I love my job as a Management Officer, but my
partner and I had grown tired of struggling with a bureaucracy that essentially denied his existence. I had planned to

follow his career as an academic, where I could be officially recognized as his partner and receive benefits through his
employer.
The announcement that the State Department will now extend benefits to same-sex partners has made us re-evaluate our
future plans. After several long discussions over the past few days, we have decided that I will stay in the Foreign Service
indefinitely and my partner will follow me, finding teaching jobs wherever I am posted. This is not only about the benefits
themselves, which are of course most welcome. It is also the fact that my partner, who has been officially invisible all of
these years, is now recognized and respected as an equal member of the Foreign Service family.
I have much more to contribute to the Service, and I look forward to a long and successful career with my partner at my
side. Once again, my heartfelt thanks to Secretary Clinton for making our dream a reality.
Best regards,
B6
If you ever have the chance, I would very much appreciate it if you could thank Secretary Clinton on my
behalf. As I said in my letter, the extension of benefits to my partner has made me decide to stay in the
Foreign Service. I don't mean to be immodest, but I'm a good officer—and the Foreign Service will get the
benefit of my talents for many years to come thanks to Secretary Clinton!
Again, congratulations on your illustrious career.

Nora,
Just to close the loop, I did meet w/ Jeffrey Romoff and his team on Wed
afternoon. They gave a very impressive into on what the University
Medical Center of Pittsburgh (UPMC) is doing in Southern Italy. They are
already getting a lot of political support from our Emb in Rome and are
grateful for it.
I gave them some practical suggestions on other levers in the USG that
they could pull (TDA, OPIC, Commerce Advocacy Center).
They want the Secretary will make some positive reference to Berlusconi in
Italy this summer of their interest in working the GOI to build a
lab/production facility for developing vaccines for H1N1 and other
infectious diseases. They also note the coincidence of the G20 mtng in
Pittsburgh later this summer. I made no commitment. But I do believe this
is a genuinely positive program and our Emb agrees.
I did pass their materials to David Thorne and urged him to be in
touch. He said he would engage, once/if he is confirmed.

Hi Phil. How are you?
The Secretary is hoping you can schedule a meeting with the President of the University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center. He is working on a project with the Italians and is seeking some guidance. I included some background below.
Please let me know if you are available for a meeting and I'll connect you with them. Thanks!
• UPMC's Relationship with Italy:
UPMC has a long and successful track record in Italy. More than a decade ago, UPMC entered into a public-
private partnership in Italy, and in collaboration with the region of Sicily and two existing
hospitals, established a major transplant and specialty care hospital. The construction of the

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762435 Date: 06/30/2015
facility, ("ISMETT") was funded by the government and UPMC , which oversaw the
construction and continues to manage it. It has been a great success - bringing transplantation and
specialized services to Sicily, reducing costs to the nation of "exporting" patients who need transplants, and as
an economic driver for the region. Based on the success of ISMETT, UPMC is now working with
the Italian government and an alliance of educational institutions to construct RIMED, a Biomedical Research
and Biotechnology Center (BRBC) outside of Palermo, which will focus on sparking a
biotechnology/regenerative medicine sector in the region. (Please see attached RiMED document.) The
government has appropriated 330 million Euros for this initiative. Further, UPMC is a consultant to the Italian
Government and is in negotiations with the regional governments in Milan and Florence. Our international
offices are in Rome.
• UPMC's Relationship with Prime Minister Berlusconi:
(a.) UPMC has had a long term and stable relationship in Italy over the past ten years, including two
governments led by Prime Minister Berlusconi. He is knowledgeable about UPMC, as is Giarmi Letta, Italian
Council of Ministry Under Secretary.
(b.) The RiMED initiative was conceived during his previous term of office and in 2005, the letter of intent for
RiMED was personally signed by Prime Minister Berlusconi and Mr. Jeffrey A. Romoff, President of UPMC.
(c.) It was under the Berlusconi administration that the decision was made to fund RiMED and 330 million
Euros were appropriated for this purpose. Mr. Romoff participated in a press conference at Palazzo Chigi
with the Prime Minister.
(d.) Recently, because of the devastating earthquake and the economic downturn, the resources to fund
RiMED have become constrained, but it is felt this is simply an issue of an unexpected contingency, rather than
any lack of interest and support.
(e.) Mr. Romoff has met with Prime Minister Berlusconi several times and is fluent in Italian.
(f .) Many of the significant political figures in Sicily are very closely associated with the Prime Minister and
his party and the importance of UPMC to the Region and potentially to Italy is reinforced.
• UPMC's Proposed 21CB:
We are pursuing funding for a flexible, multi-product biologics facility in Southwestern PA, to develop and
manufacture vaccines and therapeutic drugs as a defense against our nation's gravest threat: the Pandemic
spread of diseases and diseases used by bioterrorists as weapons of mass destruction. Thanks
to the tremendous help from our partners, Governor Rendell and Senator Arlen Specter, we have garnered
wide spread support from many across the executive Branch and Congress including Vice President Biden and
HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. We will have the opportunity to brief DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano on
June 15th. The economic impact to the region would be unparalleled, resulting in approximately 1000 direct
jobs and up to 6000 indirect jobs, all the while reducing production costs to the U. S. Government by 80
%. (Please see attached 21st Century Biodefense document.)
• UPMC's Proposal for the Italian Government:

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762435 Date: 06/30/2015
Prime Minister Berlusconi is very much tied to the American agenda and would likely be interested in
developing and funding a companion vaccine manufacturing facility- (600 million Euros,) under UPMC
management, which would serve not only to enhance the strategic defense relationship between Italy and the
United States, but also demonstrate that the Prime Minister is responsive to the increasing public concern
regarding H1N1. It can be an economic driver to both countries, as well. Italy has close ties in the
Mediterranean basin and northern Africa, in particular, and producing vaccines for these countries is desirable
in keeping with the newUS. Global Health Care Initiative. Thus, for both substantive and strategic/political
reasons, the 21CB vaccine facility should be exceedingly attractive to Italy.
As importantly, the economic gains for UPMC and the western region of Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh) are
very significant. As the largest employer in western Pa. , the Region depends on UPMC's
economic vitality. Excess revenue (profits) gained from exporting the intellectual and managerial capital
cultivated and developed in Pittsburgh to Italy and abroad, serve to create jobs and growth at home. Given
the unique expertise of UPMC and the international focus on health care reform, this is potentially a multi-
billion dollar export industry bring both funds and prestige to the United States.

Subject: FW: Your June 22, 2009 article on the Prague Conference
Dear Cheryl and Susan,
Below is a response from the American Gathering of Holocaust Survivors, the largest and most well-known Holocaust
survivor group in the United States, strongly opposing a letter to Secretary of State Clinton, which was simultaneously
sent to Haaretz in Israel, from a group of survivors based in South Florida, asking that I be replaced as head of the U.S.
delegation because of my association with the Jewish Claims Conference. I will separately send their initial letter.
I have talked with Ambassador Christian Kennedy about this scurrilous and unrepresentative attack, made just before the
Prague Conference is to begin. We agree it emanates from two related causes. First, it was instigated by Sam Dubbin, a
class action lawyer in Miami who has spent the better part of ten years trying to get Congress to overturn the agreements
I negotiated on behalf of the Clinton Administration, which obtained over $8 billion for Holocaust survivors and other
victims of Nazi persecution around the world. He wants to be free to sue the very companies who paid these sums, in
return for getting assurances of the U.S. government would do all it could to provide "legal peace" from future suits.
Several federal courts have upheld our agreements. He has lobbied for legislation last year and again this year. Indeed,
Chairman Frank held a hearing in 2008 on this matter.
The second basis of the letter is a long-standing dispute between some survivors against the Jewish Claims Conference,
based in New York City, which was officially designated in the 1950s by the governments of Germany and Israel to be the
negotiator with the German government on behalf of Jewish Holocaust survivors. The bulk of the $60 billion paid by the
German government since the 1950s in reparations is passed through the Claims Conference, which then distributes it to
survivors. Their complaints range from a lack of transparency in their operations to the 80%-20% split, by which 80% of
their proceeds go directly to survivors and 20% to various Jewish organizations for projects of remembrance and
education about the Holocaust.
My association with the Jewish Claims Conference, which was fully disclosed during my vetting, is very tangential. I
volunteered to lead their once a year negotiation with the German government to improve pensions for survivors, to
provide new services like home care, and to increased the population of survivors covered by the German government. I
have done this once, in March of this year, with, by the way, major breakthroughs for survivors. None of these issues is
involved in the Prague Conference, and the German government has no problem with my participation. That is the only
involvement I have with the Claims Conference. I do not participate in their governing bodies, and have no hand in their
allocation or other decisions. I will not be involved again, until their next negotiation, in 2010, unless I decide not to
continue my voluntary negotiation for them.
Moreover, the letter is unbelievably inaccurate. While I have only been involved for several weeks as the official head of
the delegation, it is grossly inaccurate for them to allege that survivors have been left out of the process. Ambassador
Kennedy has done remarkable outreach to the survivor community for many months, in preparation for the Prague
Conference, and survivors are well represented on the Delegation. In the period since I have been officially involved, I
have met with the German Insurance Association to see if they would make a contribution for the social needs of
survivors; have talked with Judah Gribetz, the Special Master for the Swiss bank settlement, to see if any of the extra
sums they will have left over can be given to survivors; have worked to get language in the Terezin Declaration to
encourage countries to set up special funds for survivors and to use heirless property to assist them.

Subject: Your June 22, 2009 article on the Prague Conference
Dear Mr. Liphshiz,
With respect to your article yesterday on the utterly unwarranted personal attack on Ambassador Stuart
Eizenstat by a group of American Holocaust survivors, you should be aware that the leadership of the largest
organization of survivors and descendants of survivors in the United States, the American Gathering of Jewish
Holocaust Survivors and Their Descendants, in no way shares these sentiments. On the contrary, we hold
Ambassador Eizenstat in the highest esteem, know him to be a man of the highest integrity and ethical
standards, and are deeply grateful to him for everything he has done and continues to do on behalf of the
survivors over many years.
Neither David Schaecter nor Leo Rechter speak for anyone other than the groups they represent, and Mr.
Rechter's statement that survivors have "no confidence" in Ambassador Eizenstat is, viewed most charitably, a
gross overstatement in that he seeks to attribute his personal prejudices to the many thousands of survivors who
do not share his views and who have never authorized him to speak in their name. The lives of thousands upon
thousands of survivors throughout the world have been made easier over the past 15 years thanks to
Ambassador Eizenstat's tireless work on their behalf. I cannot think of anyone more appropriate to head the
U.S. delegation to the Prague conference.
The fact is that Ambassador Eizenstat's only association with the Claims Conference is a once a year, three day
negotiation as a volunteer with the German government for the interests of the survivors. The first such
negotiation took place earlier this year in March and resulted in 13,000 survivors who had previously been
turned down becoming eligible for for reparations for the first time, and in the improvement in existing pension
payments to survivors totaling over $50 million. Moreover, the specific pension issues for which he
volunteered to negotiate with the German government bear no relationship to the issues being covered by the
Prague Conference.
During the Clinton Administration, Ambassador Eizenstat was the Special Representative of the President and
Secretary of State on Holocaust era issues and the lead negotiator on such issues with the Swiss, German,
Austrian and French governments, as well as with various Eastern and Central European governments. In that
capacity, he obtained over $8 billion dollars in compensation and restitution for Holocaust survivors, including
payments to slave and forced laborers, the return of thousands of Jewish communal and private properties, the
payments of tens of thousands of previously undisclosed bank accounts, the recovery of hundreds of pieces of
looted art, and the payments on thousands of insurance policies. Indeed, Ambassador Eizenstat is more
responsible than any other single person for placing the issue of justice for Holocaust survivors on the
international agenda more than half a century after the end of World War II. He has also headed the U.S.
delegations to every one of the four previous international conferences dealing with Holocaust era assets,
beginning with the 1997 London Conference on Nazi Gold. Messrs. Schaecter and Rechter are well aware of
all this, and the fact that they chose to engage in an ad hominem attack against Ambassador Eizenstat one week
before the opening of the Prague conference - his appointment as head of the U.S. delegation was publicly
announced weeks ago - is unseemly and disingenuous in the extreme.

The Lins e Silva family will appear on CBS tomorrow morning with a tape showing an interview with Sean
Goldman where he says he wants to live in Brazil and that he considers Lins e Silva his father. David Goldman
and his attorneys are extremely upset about Sean being exploited this way. The federal court that just
decided that David should have custody whenever he is in Brazil believes the Lins e Silva family and maternal
grandparents are doing all they can to alienate Sean from his father.
We have been asked to provide CBS with a written statement about all that is being done to reunite Sean with

Here is what we know about the tape:
Family Releases New Psych Transcript
Brazilian press have reported the release of a transcript of a new psychological interview of Sean Goldman,
quoting Sean as stating that he considers Lins e Silva his father and that he wants to stay in Brazil. Press
reports indicate that this interview was taped, and took place in front of witnesses from the Rio state level
children's rights organizations. At least one report then referred to the controversy of the psychological exam,
and quotes a psychologist as saying that the mother's family may be increasing the boy's suffering by making
him talk once more, thereby reliving the child's traumas. Almost all reporting points out that the psychologist
conducting the interview was hired by the maternal family

Dear Cheryl and Susan,
I am pleased to inform you that following two long conference calls with the Holocaust Survivors' Foundation and Sam
Dubbin, their lawyer, and with the timely intervention of Congressman Robert Wexler, the Foundation has sent the
letter below by FAX to Secretary Clinton, withdrawing their objection and supporting my efforts.
It was clear from the call that they are
to all the major Jewish organizations, from the
American Jewish Committee and ADL to the Jewish Claims Conference. But they are a voice we should hear,
Thanks and best wishes,

Dear Secretary Clinton:
With reference to our letter dated June 19, 2009, on behalf of the Holocaust Survivors Foundation USA, Inc. (HSF), I
would like to state that based on conversations that took place in the intervening time period between Ambassador
Eizenstat and the leadership of the HSF, and the commitments he made to our leaders, we are no longer asking that he
be replaced as the head of the U.S. delegation to the Prague Conference taking place on June 26-30.
On behalf of all of the survivors for whom we have been fighting over the last decade, including tens of thousands in
desperate need, we wish Ambassador Eizenstat the best of success as the head of the United States delegation at the
Conference, as well as in the follow-up activities that we understand will occur on matters affecting Holocaust survivors'
rights and interests.
Sincerely,
David Schaecter

Attached is the flyer for today's event to be held at noon in the Dean Acheson Auditorium.
Our staff observed to our dismay that during the night or early this morning, someone removed and discarded all of
the flyers for this event which we had placed in elevator wells throughout the building.
We consider this Anti - Gay vandalism, and though not entirely unexpected, it certainly cannot be tolerated.
My staff is in the process of reprinting and distributing the announcements, which are critical to ensure the broadest
possible publicity for attendance. Moreover it is very important that GLIFFA understand the Department of State
supports them as fully as we do all other Affinity Groups. Moreover, we will protect their rights to assembly, free
speech, and freedom from harassment.
We ask that you immediate help in monitoring the elevator wells and other spaces for the next two hours to deter
and discourage vandals. Please have your personnel approach anyone in the act of unauthorized poster removal, and
take any other measures you deem appropriate to deal with this situation.
Thank you for the advice you have already given and thanks in advance for the assistance and support you will render to
address this problem.

Longtime Clinton confidant Blumenthal to become Clinton advisor
Tue, 06/23/2009 - 1:00pm
Longtime journalist and former Clinton White House advisor Sidney Blumenthal will become a special advisor
without portfolio to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, The Cable has learned. Blumenthal refused to comment.
But sources say he is filling out the paperwork and disentangling himself from other obligations as he moves to
become a special advisor to the secretary whose presidential campaign he helped advise. The position would
not require Senate confirmation.
Clinton, who is recovering from surgery to repair a broken elbow, has been building her team at the State
Department, while establishing her credentials as a team player supporting and amplifying her former
presidential rival's foreign-policy vision. Sources close to her says she will prove indispensable to Obama, a
point several Obama aides also made to Politico's Ben Smith in a piece noting the relatively background role
she has played in these early months. The planned addition of Blumenthal, a longtime confidant of the Clinton
family and a fierce defender of Bill Clinton's presidential legacy, could indicate she plans to raise her profile.
(Blumenthal is probably Clinton's best speechwriter, a friend notes.)
In the foreign-policy arena, Blumenthal advised former President Clinton on U.S.-British relations, and first
introduced him to future British Prime Minister Tony Blair. He has also been active in the Third Way-
Progressive Governance process. A former Washington Post reporter, Blumenthal has contributed
commentary and editorial advice to Vanity Fair, Tina Brown's new online magazine The Daily Beast, the New
Yorker, and Salon. Blumenthal has also been a fellow at New York University's Center on Law and Security.

Though the top part obviously has stuff that is not relevant, once she gets to substance of the piece, it has a more
detailed tit for tat that offers more research than our quick points did this morning...

The Settlers' Lawyer (or, Elliott Abrams Is At It Again)
June 25, 2009, posted by Lara Friedman
On May 23, 2005, the Washington Post ran a an incisive op-ed by former State Department negotiator and
Middle East advisor Aaron Miller, entitled"Israel's Lawyer," in which Aaron argued "For far too long, many
American officials involved in Arab-Israeli peacemaking, myself included, have acted as Israel's attorney..." I
was reminded of that article when I read today's piece by Elliott Abrams in the Wall Street Journal, which
should, I believe, have been entitled "The West Bank Settlers' Lawyer."
Before anyone accuses me of casting aspersions on Mr. Abrams' honor or motivations, let me be clear: I have
no doubt he has taken the case pro bono. For him, advocating for the settlers is clearly a labor of love. And the
settlers are fortunate to have Elliott volunteering for the job. He brings a unique combination of expertise and
experience, combined, it would seem, with a shameless willingness to cherry-pick the facts and, when the facts
don't support his argument, to fall back on the "I was there and I know what happened."
An interesting approach from a man who does not have a spotless record when it comes to truth-telling and
foreign policy (for anyone who has forgotten the history: "Elliott Abrams — Pleaded guilty October 7, 1991, to
two misdemeanor charges of withholding information from Congress about secret government efforts to support
the Nicaraguan contra rebels during a ban on such aid. U.S. District Chief Judge Aubrey E. Robinson, Jr.,
sentenced Abrams November 15, 1991, to two years probation and 100 hours community service. Abrams was
pardoned December 24, 1992.")
But that was a long time ago. Let's forgot the ugly and embarrassing Iran-Contra history and focus on the
"facts" in the current case, as Elliott sees them:
In today's WSJ article, Elliott offers an almost completely unverifiable history of what he says transpired
between June 2003 and August 2005 (the date of Israel's "disengagement" from Gaza). Predictably, he focuses
on the letter President Bush gave to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon on April 14, 2004. In that letter, Elliott notes
(correctly), Bush wrote: "In light of new realities on the ground, including already existing major Israeli
populations centers, it is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and
complete return to the armistice lines of 1949."
61
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762522 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762522 Date: 06/30/2015
What Elliott neglects to mention is that in the letter Bush also re-stated his commitment to the Roadmap ("the
United States remains committed to my vision and to its implementation as described in the roadmap"), which
in stage I states that "Consistent with the Mitchell Report, GOI freezes all settlement activity (including natural
growth of settlements)."
Elliott then goes on to assert that "On settlements we also agreed on principles that would permit some
continuing growth." His evidence of such an agreement? Exhibit A: A statement by Prime Minister Sharon, not
President Bush: "Mr. Sharon stated these clearly in a major policy speech in December 2003: 'Israel will meet
all its obligations with regard to construction in the settlements. There will be no construction beyond the
existing construction line, no expropriation of land for construction, no special economic incentives and no
construction of new settlements."
Is this extremely experienced lawyer and foreign policy professional seriously arguing that a statement by
Sharon should be understood as an accurate articulation of US policy, even in the absence of any corroborating
statement by the US President? Even when that lengthy policy speech went into a range of issue where - at least
officially - there was public disagreement with the US? (for example, in this same speech Sharon makes clear
Israel views the Roadmap commitments as sequential - the Palestinians do everything they have to do, and only
then does Israel act. ) Apparently so.
But it gets better. For further evidence, Elliott asserts that, really, the US agreed with everything Sharon was
saying. His evidence? Exhibit B: A letter from Arid Sharon's Chief of Staff, Dov Weissglas, Secretary of State
Rice..
It is like saying "your honor, I swear my client did not sideswipe that car in the parking lot. I was there and I
saw the whole thing. And as proof I give you my statement and a statement from my client and his wife, written
to the owner of the damaged car, making clear that they were not the ones who hit his car. I rest my case."
So there are not quotes from President Bush or Secretary Rice to support Elliott's narrative - only statements by
Israeli officials.
But Elliot has more proof to bring before the court: media reports. Exhibit #C: Elliott notes that "Stories in the
press also made it clear that there were indeed 'agreed principles.' On Aug. 21, 2004 the New York Times
reported that 'the Bush administration . . . now supports construction of new apartments in areas already built
up in some settlements, as long as the expansion does not extend outward."
Interesting. So if the NYT reported it, it must be true, right? Or rather, what must be true is that they were
reporting what someone told them, at the time. And according to the first paragraph of the article Elliott cites,
the source is: "American and Israeli officials." Who could these officials be? Could they be Abrams himself
(who at this point can no longer deny that he is personally invested in such a policy), and maybe Dov
Weissglas? There is no way to know, but regardless, this is clearly not definitive proof of anything, other than
the fact that there were Israeli and US officials spinning the story this way.
The rest of Elliott's article is simply hearsay and innuendo, speculation, and conjecture - not a single "fact" that
can be examined, let alone refuted. Elliott rests his case on statements by two Israeli officials who never hid
their desire to do everything possible to keep building West Bank settlements, and press reports based on un-
named US and Israeli officials.
With this kind of evidence, it is hard to see why the jury is still debating this case at all. Clearly the settlers'
have a really excellent lawyer.

And since some of us prefer to rely on facts, rather than clever argumentation and bombastic statements, here
are some actual statements by President Bush about settlements, from the same period Elliott is addressing:
President Bush 9/21/04: "...Israel should impose a settlement freeze, dismantle unauthorized outposts, end the
daily humiliation of the Palestinian people and avoid any actions that prejudice final negotiations..."
President Bush,11/27/07: "...Israel must demonstrate its support for the creation of a prosperous and successful
Palestinian state by removing unauthorized outposts, ending settlement expansion, and finding other ways for
the Palestinian Authority to exercise its responsibilities without compromising Israel's security."
President Bush,1/9/2008: " ...The second track is to help both parties deal with road map issues. Settlements is
a road map issue..."
President Bush, 1/10/2008: "...Each side has got obligations under the road map. Settlements are clearly stated
in the road map obligations for Israel. We have made our concerns about expansion of settlements known, and
we expect both parties to honor their obligations under the road map."

As I told Jake and PJ, I was bit surprised that CNN (Charley Keyes) asked me at the podium if the Dept. was
concerned that the VP was seeming to be on the ascendent in foreign policy.
I talked to him off the record, and he admitted that he gets a "steady drumbeat" of requests from producers to find out "if
Hillary is holding her own" in the intragency battles, and particularly if there's infighting between her and White House.
He said what specifically prompted his q at the briefing on whether the VP was beginning to usurp S's role in foreign policy
was Gibb's announcement Tuesday that the VP was taking lead in Iraq policy (below).
I emphasized to him that the Sec is very engaged and involved in Iraq policy, noting she was on a conference call today
with Chris Hill.

overcoming their political differences and achieving the type of
reconciliation that we all understand has yet to fully take place, but
needs to take place.
QUESTION: Well, what does -- what does that mean, "oversee"? In
what way will that change or enlarge his interaction with the
president, with General Odierno or Ambassador Hill?
GIBBS: Well, I -- I mean, obviously, he spends a fairly decent
amount of time with the president.
QUESTION: Right.
GIBBS: I think the meetings that I've been in, in different
parts of the building on Iraq, the vice president has always been an
active participant. I think, given his knowledge of the region, the
number of times he's been there, he's perfectly suited for this type
of role.
QUESTION: I guess what I'm getting at, does it mean travel?
Does it mean briefing? Does it mean doing some of the things he's
done more publicly, for example, on the stimulus?
GIBBS: My sense is, it probably means many of those things.
Again, I think what we want to ensure happens is that, as we reach
these milestones and these important dates, that we not forget that
work has to be done to get our troops back and to achieve that
political reconciliation. This is somebody who can oversee that at
the White House and ensure that we're making continued progress toward
those goals.

Tauscher Wins Plaudits From Panel, But Still Faces Hold
By Caitlin Webber, CQ Staff
California Democratic Rep. Ellen 0. Tauscher enjoyed an enthusiastic reception from the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee on Tuesday, but a senior Republican said she'll be blocked from quick floor
consideration.
Senate Minority Whip Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., said he plans to place a hold on the Tauscher nomination as soon as it
is reported out of the committee, as leverage to get information and assurances from the Obama administration
on issues including — but not limited to — nuclear reduction talks with Russia and the deployment of ballistic
missile defense.
"All I'm going to ask for is for the administration to abide by commitments that it has made, which one would
think it could easily do," said Kyl. He declined to reveal the specifics of the assurances he is seeking.
As the White House's top arms control adviser, Tauscher would be charged with pushing for ratification of the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and a follow-on to the expiring Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty (START) with Russia.
Tauscher, chairwoman of the House Armed Services Strategic Forces Subcommittee, would have to contend
with considerable push-back from Senate Republicans to implement either treaty.
Many treaty opponents argue the test-ban could undermine the U.S. capacity to deter other nations from using
nuclear weapons.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762567 Date: 06/30/2015
She said Tuesday that numerous advances have been made in test-ban verification procedures and ensuring the
safety of the U.S. stockpile since the Senate rejected ratification of the CTBT nearly 10 years ago.
"Stopping nuclear proliferation by protecting our stockpile, maintaining the credibility of our deterrent and
preventing terrorists from getting a hold of a weapon of mass destruction has become my life's work," she told
the panel Tuesday.
She also said she would back President Obama's diplomatic efforts to persuade the eight other non-signatories
— China, North Korea, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Israel and Egypt — to ratify the treaty. Indonesia's
foreign minister said Monday it would ratify the CTBT, which bans all nuclear explosions for any purpose,
immediately after the United States does.
Tauscher would need to tackle critics among Senate Republicans who contend the Obama administration is
rushing into an agreement on nuclear arms reduction with Russia.
At an Armed Services Strategic Forces Subcommittee hearing last week, Sens. David Vitter, R-La., and Jeff
Sessions, R-Ala., said it was imprudent for the Obama administration to agree to reduced nuclear warhead
levels with Russia before the release of the Defense Department's Nuclear Posture Review, which sets the
course of the nation's nuclear stockpile, in early 2010. Administration negotiators aim to have a renewed
agreement with Russia before the current treaty expires on Dec. 5.
Tauscher told the Senate Foreign Relations panel Tuesday that she would work to allay those concerns. "We
can multi-task. . . . I'm confident we can assure everyone . . . that what is going on in the review is informing
the negotiations."
Chairman John Kerry, D-Mass., said he would move Tauscher's nomination quickly through the committee and
would urge the full Senate to follow quickly thereafter.

NAACP's Bond at the W.H.
By CAROL E. LEE
Tensions between the White House and the NAACP over President Obama.s upcoming address at the
groups 100th ...
....anniversary celebration were *not totally resolved after leaders of the influential civil rights
organization met with two senior White House aides Thursday morning.
*There.s some scheduling adjustments that have to be made,* Julian Bond told POLITICO as he left the
West Wing. But he.s coming..
Bond and Hilary Shelton, the NAACP.s vice president for advocacy, said they met with White House senior
adviser Valerie Jarrett and her chief of staff, Michael Strautmanis.
Bond said the NAACP and the White House have agreed on a date • July 16 but have yet to settle on a time
when Obama will address the groups conference. At issue is the venue.
Ideally Obama.s speech would be at a location that makes it easy for everyone to see him* Bond said. So
far the White House has rejected some suggestions including Yankee Stadium • citing security reasons, and
there is a dispute over exactly what time he will speak.
*It was a healthy, helpful conversation,. Shelton said of the meeting.
Shelton and Bond said they did not see Obama while they were in the West Wing for roughly 45 minutes.
Attorney General Eric Holder is scheduled to address the NAACP.s conference on July 13, they said, and
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is also trying to schedule in appearance. The conference is being held from
July 11 to 16.
Shelton noted that Obama has not missed an annual NAACP meeting since he was elected to the Senate in

2004.
And on his way into the meeting, Bond suggested that Obama has the NAACP to thank for his election to the
presidency.
If it weren.t for the work of the NAACP over the past century, he told Urban Radios April Ryan, .a black
man would not be president of the United States today..

Bill Clinton raising bucks for Maloney
Former President Clinton will be keeping his commitment to host a fundraiser for Rep. Carolyn Maloney, who
has irritated other Democratic leaders by announcing she*s challenging Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) in a
primary.
The July 20 fundraiser with Clinton*in Manhattan had been in the works for months, well before Maloney
announced she would be running against Gillibrand. The former president has not endorsed in the race for his
wife*s former Senate seat and is not planning to issue an endorsement, according to his spokesman.
Clinton held a fundraiser for Gillibrand in March soon after she was appointed to the Senate by Gov. David
Paterson (D-N.Y).
The fundraiser is for Maloney*s House fund but in practical terms, the fundraiser has the same effect as raising
money for a Senate campaign. Maloney is allowed to transfer unlimited sums from her House campaign
account to any future Senate account, according to FEC law.
Clinton spokesman Matt McKenna said the fundraiser is part of a series of events where the former president is
helping out elected officials who supported his wife*s 2008 presidential campaign.
*We agreed to do this event some time ago, as a way of saying thank you for the congresswoman*s hard
work on behalf of then-Sen. Clinton in the presidential campaign* said McKenna.
But Clinton is steering clear from helping another Hillary-supporting House Democrat who is also challenging a
sitting senator in a primary. POLITICO reported last month that Clinton wont be holding any fundraisers for
Rep. Joe Sestak (D-Pa.), a Clinton pal who is running against Sen. Arlen Specter (D-Pa.).
Specter has been endorsed by President Obama, Vice President Biden and Gov. Ed Rendell (D-Pa.), who was
also one of Hillary*s most dedicated supporters in 2008.

U.S. President Obama has sent a personal appeal to Kyrgyzstan proposing ways to discuss "expanding cooperation".
Kyrgyzstan will not reverse its decision to close a U.S. military air base which is used to supply American troops for
Afghanistan occupation, Kyrgyz Foreign Minister Kadyrbek Sarbayev said on Thursday. U.S. President Barack Obama
has sent a personal appeal to Kyrgyzstan proposing ways to discuss "expanding cooperation".
But Bakiyev's office said in a statement it had received a letter from Obama praising bilateral relations. "Moreover,
Barack Obama expressed hope to further strengthen various forms of cooperation between the United States and
Kyrgyzstan," the statement said without mentioning the air base issue. "The decision to annul all agreements on the
Manas military air base has been taken and there is no turning back on this," he told the 24.kg news agency.

The bottom line of all of them was not dissimiliar to this message from torn so forwarding this one - namely, all had been
unsuccessful in dissuading Zeleya from going today and several leaders and fm (espinoza) thought call from you might
help but Zeleya appeared in update messages to get more resolute as evening went on to return based upon readouts of

I just got off the phone with President Fernandez. His efforts to dissuade Zelaya and Company from traveling tomorrow
have not been successful. He was very worried about what would happen, and requested our help in ensuring that no
incidents take place at the airport.
I told him I shared his concern. I summarized for him our efforts to date, and told him that nascent engagement with
the armed forces and the de facto government would collapse if Zelaya tried to force the issue tomorrow. I told him of
the Cardinal's plea to Zelaya to not return. He said the Cardinal in Santo Domingo is close to the Honduran Cardinal, and
said he would reach out to him. I encouraged this. I told him that I thought the elements of a deal were on the table,
we just needed to find a way to get everyone to sit at the table and start talking. I told President Fernandez that he
could play an important role in creating a climate of confidence, and suggested that he reach out to interested parties
like Ricardo Maduro and others inside of Honduras. He said he would do so and get back to me

the outskirts of the city last night where they will begin their march today. Zelaya and
his supporters have been encouraging Zelaya supporters from the interior to come into the
capital and support Zelaya's arrival. Many of these are rural poor and indigenous from
his popular strongholds in the Departments of Copan Intibuca, and Lempira. We also know
that many bus loads of Z supporters are coming in from his home province of Olancho.
Zelaya is not popular in Tegucigalpa, so the potential for confrontation is high.

They are now saying that Zelaya doesn't want to travel tomorrow because wants to participate (remotely) in the burial
ceremony on Monday for those who died in violence at the airport today. He said he will return to Washington on
Tuesday in time to meet in the late afternoon. They are asking if it would be possible to have the meeting sometime on
Tuesday late afternoon instead.

Huma and Lona,
Sorry for the late email, but Central America Office Director Christopher Webster just called me to inquire about a
possible meeting between Zelaya and the Secretary tomorrow. He said they are trying to convince Zelaya to return from
San Salvador to the U.S. and that A/S Shannon indicated the Secretary had said that she would be willing to meet with
him tomorrow. They were wondering if they could give Zelaya a window of time for a meeting (see email below from
DCM in Sal Salvador). Please advise.

Looping other members of SITREP spam -- Managua understands that plane with ousted HOND President Zelaya left
WDC at approx 1500 WDC time. Also understand that plane is expected in Managua at approx 1924 local. Understand
that a separate plane with Argentine Pres Kirchner and Ecuadorian Pres. Correa also left WDC this afternoon en route to
El Salvador.
NEW INFORMATION
About 45 minutes ago, Telesur had images of apparent pro-Zelaya supporters at the airport fence and trying to pull it
down. Security forces inside the airport compound re-deployed to prevent a breach. It seems they did use white smoke
or gas to deter protestor action. Telesur also reported that shots were fired into the assembled crowd and that one or
two people were shot and killed (no names or confirmation). Images of ambulances in crowd were visible.
It seems now that the fence has been breached and a handful of pro-Zelaya supporters move in and out of airport area
to pick up rocks and retreat (there is open, clear area inside fence, possible construction). Security forces have taken up
positions on tarmac, presumably to prevent further incursion.
With respect to Micheleti assertion that NIC troops have mobilized near the border, our NIC contacts, both in GON and
private citizens indicate that there has been NO/NO unusual NIC mil activity at border -- Las Manos or El Espino.
However, as of 1900 Saturday, border contacts at El Espino report that HOND military reinforced its presence by about
70 personnel, who remain at El Espino. We were told this happened at Las Manos as well, but have not yet been able to
confirm with our sources at that border location.
Will continue to monitor and observe.

Saddam's rule 'better' for gay Iraqis
Investigating reports of the murder and torture of gay men in Iraq, Ashley Byrne found that some gays
found Saddam Hussein's dictatorship preferable to the threat of violence they face today. Some readers
will find parts of his report disturbing.
There has been so much news of death and destruction from Iraq that the position of sexual minorities is rarely
touched on in the mainstream media.
But stories of torture and murder of gay Iraqis, particularly men, have been emerging in the gay press for several
years.
Investigating these stories for a BBC Radio 5 Live documentary, Gay Life After Saddam, I've heard a range of views
about the deteriorating conditions for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) people.
Some say the violence has intensified in the past few months. Others say killings run into the hundreds and have been
going on since 2003.
What is clear, and confirmed by separate evidence from various human rights groups, is that some gay men have
been subjected to appalling violent abuse.
One young Iraqi, Amil (not his real name) recalled the death of a friend: "They found out he was gay and they killed
him and they chopped him like a lamb, it was awful."
Another man (who wished to remain anonymous) revealed to Scott Long from the New York-based Human Rights
Watch, how his partner was kidnapped and killed.
"It was late one night when four armed men came to take my boyfriend from his parents' house.
L
" They found out he was gay and they killed him and they chopped him like a lamb"
Amil, a gay Iraqi
"They were masked and dressed in black.
"We found his body the next day dumped in the garbage, his throat cut out, his genitals cut off."

Of all the shocking testimony we heard, a form of torture involving glue has to be the most awful revelation to emerge
from our investigations.
Human Rights Watch researcher Rasha Moumneh told us: "We've heard stories of gay-specific torture where men
have glue in their anuses and they force-feed them laxatives."
Gay men inside Iraq have been able to seek sanctuary in safe houses, thanks to the UK-based Iraqi Lesbian Gay
Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) group, which manages them from London.
The documentary team were granted exclusive access to one of the homes on the outskirts of Baghdad, where we
found a 31-year-old transsexual man called Qasim (not his real name).
Qasim said: "I'm scared all the time. I often think people are going to come in the night and take me because I am
particularly known as gay."
All the LGBT Iraqis interviewed for Gay Life After Saddam maintained that life was easier for them when Saddam
Hussein was in power, from 1979 to 2003.
Some spoke fondly of an underground gay culture that flourished before the war in Baghdad.
But it was unclear exactly what Saddam's view on homosexuality was, and there has been some evidence to suggest
that the former dictator was acting to clamp down on sexual minorities in the latter years of his reign.
So who is to blame for the violence against LGBT people in Iraq?
Some blame militia, while other accuse religious leaders of stoking up hatred of homosexuals, though some clerics
have also recently condemned the attacks on gays.
The Iraqi government and police also deny that there have been any state-sanctioned killings or torture of
homosexuals in Iraq.
What is clear however is that gay people in Iraq have not been crushed.
He may be holed up in a safe house but Qasim is hopeful: "I find the Iraqi prime minister quite good.
"I hope he can talk with religious leaders, change the constitution and punish and imprison the murderers."
Meanwhile the refugee who runs the safe houses from London, All HiIli, lives in constant fear of his life after being sent
two fatwas, or Islamic religious rulings.
But he has insisted he will not give up trying to help gay people in Iraq.
"If I think too much that someone is going to get me and kill me then I know I'd stop what I'm doing.
"I have to continue because I really believe in the work that I am doing."
Gay Life After Saddam was broadcast on Radio 5 Live, Sunday 5 July.

Ghana, but not forgotten
By: Josh Gerstein
July 4, 2009 07:38 PM EST
It might seem like a moment just too good for the White House to pass up — America's first
black president, on his first trip to sub-Saharan Africa, looking out over a sea of jubilant
faces, delivering a message of friendship and hope.
Yet President Barack Obama, who would command a monumental audience nearly
anywhere he spoke on the continent where he traces his ancestry, is not scheduled to
deliver a speech to the general public when he visits Ghana next week.
The White House said it preferred a smaller event at Ghana's parliament to herald the
nation's democratic traditions. But some suspect the reason has its roots in an event that
holds a storied place in White House lore — President Bill Clinton's 1998 speech to a
massive crowd in the sweltering heat of Accra, Ghana, where Obama will visit as well.
For Clinton, the first stop on a 12-day, six-country African journey was a chance to bask in
the adulation far from Washington, then consumed with the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
Clinton now regularly pegs the size of the crowd that day at 1 million, though years ago he
described it simply as more than 500,000.
Whatever the number, the overheated, overcrowded, overwhelming event left some in
Clinton's party worried that he'd been shot, and a doctor concerned that he could contract
HIV from frantic interaction with the crowd. And it took a threatening turn at the end, as a
red-faced, shouting Clinton implored the crowd, "Get back! Back off!" as it threatened to
crush a woman near the front of the stage.
"The crowd was so large that it began surging towards the stage. Suddenly, a woman in
the front of the crowd began to get trampled," recalled Sandy Berger, Clinton's national
security adviser at the time. "Clinton jumped up and put his arm down over the side and
grabbed her. The Secret Service thought he'd been shot and freaked out."

"He saved her life," Berger said. "It was a kind of tumultuous scene."
Clinton's White House physician Dr. Connie Mariano said she started out that day worried
about the heat, but wound up concerned about HIV.
"It was steamy, and hot, and miserable," Mariano recalled. "[Ghana's president General
Jerry] Rawlings put a ceremonial robe over [Clinton's] dark business suit and I thought,
'Oh my God, he's going to pass out," she said.
Mariano said the feverish crowd and the scuffle over people being crushed at the front left
the president nicked up.
"He got scratches. His hands were cut because people's nails were scratching him
because they wanted to hold him," she said. "Realize how many HIV-positive people there
were there. ... It was an extremely frightening experience."
As the crowd surged forward, police wielding rubber truncheons slammed them down on
the hands of people holding onto the barricades. The front-line people would jump back,
only to be pushed forward, grab the barricades, and have their hands whacked again.
Reporters offering bottled water to parched Ghanaians nearly triggered a stampede.
"I just remember the mass of flesh. There was like a gazillion people, more than I had ever
seen in my life," said Ann Scales, who covered the event for The Boston Globe.
Clinton's speechwriter that day, Ted Widmer, recalled a feeling of sensory overload.
"It was surreal in many ways — just one sensation after the next," he said. "Sweat was
pouring out of every pore in my body. ... I was seeing these people do a lion dance with
deafening drums. ... I've been at plenty of unmemorable political speeches. This one was
carnival-esque and fun."
During the presidential primary campaign last year, Clinton often invoked the memory of
his Accra speech as an example of when he was at his rhetorical peak. "Back when I was
in politics, I was a reasonably good speaker," Clinton told college students in Austin,
Texas last February. "I once spoke to a million people in Ghana."
Estimates of how many people were actually on hand that day vary widely. In Clinton's
book, "My Life," he says "more than half a million people." White House officials speaking
to reporters that day said security aides to Rawlings had also estimated the crowd at more
than 500,000. However, The Associated Press reported that Ghanaian officials put it at
more than 1 million. The New York Times used the half-million estimate, but also reported
that Independence Square, where Clinton spoke, "has a capacity of more than 200,000."
Whatever the true number, Obama isn't trying to top it. He'll address Ghana's parliament,
meet the country's president, and tour a slave fort on Ghana's coast on the final stop of
week-long trip that also takes him to Russia to meet the country's leaders and Italy for a
G-8 summit and to see Pope Benedict XVI.
A senior White House official, speaking on background, said staging Obama's major
speech at the parliament "primarily reflects and emphasizes the importance of different

institutions in the political life of Ghana," the official said.
In a briefing for reporters this week, the National Security Council's director for African
Affairs, Michelle Gavin, indicated Obama's main interaction with ordinary people during his
less-than-24-hour visit will come at the Accra airport during "a departure ceremony that
will allow more Ghanaians an opportunity to participate in the visit."
In addition to the challenges inherent in controlling a friendly crowd, another possible
factor weighing against a major outdoor speech by Obama is the terrorist threat posed by
at Qaeda. The bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania came in August
1998, about five months after Clinton spoke to the throngs in Ghana. Since September 11,
2001, there have also been reports of al Qaeda activity in the West African countries
Liberia and Sierra Leone.
"It's another world," Mariano said. "We were pre-9/11 with Clinton. After 9/11, everything
changed."
Even without a formal public event, thousands of Ghanaians are sure to flock into the
streets in the hopes of getting a glimpse of Obama. There should be no shortage of
pictures of excited Africans cheering the U.S. president's visit.
When President George W. Bush went to Ghana in February 2008, he avoided venues
that might draw a large crowd. There was no grand speech. Bush met with Peace Corps
volunteers at the U.S. ambassador's residence, talked to development groups at a foreign
trade center, took in a one-inning tee-ball game, and attended a State Dinner at Osu
Castle, which was then the seat of government.
One highlight of Bush's visit was the performance of the U.S. national anthem by
American Idol winner Jordin Sparks, who works against malaria.
Of course, in a sense Obama may already have broken whatever record Clinton set in
Accra 11 years ago. When Obama was sworn in in January, Washington, D.C. officials
estimated the crowd at 1.8 million. Other estimates ranged from 800,000 to 3 million. Of
course, no one was in danger of heatstroke. Frostbite was more like it.
In 2008, during the presidential campaign, Obama spoke in Germany to a crowd Berlin
police estimated at more than 200,000.
The purported million-strong turnout for Clinton's speech is all the more impressive given
Ghana's size. The country's population back in 1998 was estimated at 18.5 million, while
about 2 million people lived in the capital.
Berger said Ghanaians still remember the event fondly. "I was in Ghana two weeks ago
and people still talk about it," he said. "Everybody I talked to said they were there."
Scales said keeping Obama out of a mass-crowd situation is "probably a very smart
decision."
"President Clinton was considered by some the first black president," she said. "Just
imagine what kind of crowd America's real first black president could draw."

I asked if there are any long trips she's passionate about we would work it out — she said only two — if HRC ever goes to
Antarctica and Africa. I said we would work those out (her cousin is Amb to Angola so that is her real interest).
She was pleased she was impactful.

No — I wasn't invited to this. I can't anyway — I need to go over to USAID for an event we're hosting w/
IFPRI. S/P recently drafted a policy paper on Africa and I worked contributed a lot to that paper. I see one big
issue missing from those questions —the issue of China in Africa. China is transforming the continent in a way
not seen since the days of colonialism.
We should also think about China in the context of food security. There are one million Chinese
farmers currently working in Africa! That's remarkable if you think about it. China has also bought nearly 3
million hectares of land in Africa and could become one of the largest sources of commercial farming on the
continent. They are also building many of the roads that will transform transportation and the movement of
agriculture products.

Cheryl, Jake,
I owe you both an apology. I had a very productive flight (8-10 hours in a darkened quiet cabin is just what I needed) and
finished Les Gelb's book -- it is astonishing how close our analyses are -- he says that foundation of US power is to
catalyze others to get problems solved. HRC wanted me to make the speech harder and I see some very good ways to do
that -- talking about assembling power coalitions to deal w/ troublesome states, a term Les uses.
But I also had a chance to reread the frame that you put together, much more carefully. There are a number of very
good things in it that I am going to try to work into a revision, or at least flag for how we can build off of this speech in
subsequent speeches. I am sorry that I didn't see that in the press of trying to get to this point.
I will have a revision by Sunday afternoon China time, which would allow her and you to see it Sunday morning.

From: Jim Kennedy

Cc:
Sent: I-n may 19 U1:35:4/ 1009
Subject: Re: FW: Frame
I think this is very good. I really like the emphasis on security, which is part of her brand, and very relevant (I
always have in the back of my mind the possibility that great tragedy will strike again, so we need to prepared
to deal with that reality, should it come about some day).
I like combining that with the notion of prosperity and humanity, which together covers so much ground - from
economic development to human rights.
A couple miscl thoughts --
- in terms of promoting prosperity/economic development, might there be a reason to technological
advancement (giving people access to education and technological tools that can help them in terms of both
education and access to social networks and other avenues for advancement). You do reference education in the
development arena, and in prosperity, so that's good).
- there isn't much here mentioning democratization, freedom, etc. I know that is probably dicey given the
multitude of governments we want to partner with that aren't ready to talk that talk, but still think it needs to be
incorporated in some aspect of a mission statement.
- really like strong reference to women as a key to economic and social stabilization. That ties into her "brand"
and into a reality. I know when the First Ladies of Africa came out here to LA, one of the desires was to try to
draw them into an alliance that might transcend their own national differences and create cross-border force for
positive change. A friend of mine is one of the executives with the Hunger Project, whose CEO is a woman
who focuses, too, on the way targeting women can help alleviate hunger in ways that just dealing with men or
generally cannot.
- really like that 'variable geometry' reference. This is kind of like 3 dimensional chess - strange and
complicated alliances need to be made to grapple with a multitude of cross-cutting challenges. This is calculus,
not arithmetic.
- would like to be sure religions are involved here, vis a vis the various partnerships. It can be either a
powerful force of positive change, or it can get in the way of progress, depending on how it's used or abused,

but to the extent allowed Constitutionally, the power of religion should be encouraged in the direction of
alliances and partnerships of progress.
- as I think about Kennan's "containment" doctrine a little further - in some ways it can be reapplied to
extremism, meaning that our goal should be to contain not Communism this time, but extremist ideology
whereever it exists, and just as Kerman supported, development is one of the ways to build those walls of
containment around a dangerous ideology. We want to contain extremist, nihilistic, violent ideologies and
movements whereever they might take root, and a good way to do that is to focus on development, on women,
on technology, on education.
The power of diplomacy rests on two foundations. On the one hand, there is the reality and potentiality of
military force. Without having the capacity to defend, and to project force, diplomacy is inherently weak and
ineffectual.
On the other hand, development is the other foundation upon which successful diplomacy can be built. It's the
carrot to the military's stick. And the State Department has an integral role to play in both the diplomatic and
developmental parts of that tripod (while also being understanding of, and when necessary supportive of,
implementing the military part).
The connective tissue of security, prosperity and humanity is, as you suggest, "purpose," or more prosaically -
"morality." Morals. It is immoral for people to live in fear, to be unprotected, to be subject to harm and
death. It is immoral for people's human rights to be violated, to not have access to education and heatlh. And it
is immoral to be denied the opportunity to grow, to create a better future for children, etc. To let, as Roy has
said, every child to live up to his or her God-given potential.
one last point - on shared humanity, perhaps protecting the natural resources of the Earth - environmentalism -
should be referenced along with health and human rights. It's part of the underpinning of our international
morality and the kind of partnership we need to solve global warming, etc.

A US Expo 2010 pavilion, after all.
http://shanghaiscrap.com/?p=3350
Filed under:Expo 2010, Expo 2010 - US Pavilion, US Politics — posted by Adam on July 11, 2009 @ 7:00 am
Coming at the end of a tumultuous week in China marked by earthquakes, riots, and continued economic
uncertainty, the news that the US had finally confirmed that its participation in Expo 2010 (a/k/a, next year's
world fair) didn't seem particularly significant. And, with much of Shanghai's foreign correspondent corps
preoccupied with more pressing news elsewhere in China, it didn't receive much coverage. Fair enough, I think.
However, insofar as the US pavilion – or lack thereof– had become an increasingly thorny diplomatic issue
between China and the United States, the signing ceremony was an important signal that some kind of
resolution was at hand.
I've been following the mostly sad saga of the US pavilion for several months now, both on Shanghai Scrap,
and elsewhere. And, until two weeks ago, there was absolutely no reason to believe that a participation
agreement would ever be signed. Shanghai Expo, Inc., a non-profit authorized by the US State Department to
fund-raise, design, build, and operate a US pavilion, had failed to raise sufficient funds to break ground. At
yesterday's signing ceremony, Beatrice Camp, the US Consul General in Shanghai blamed the underwhelming
fundraising on the global economic crisis – a point that was picked up by the Chinese media. No doubt, the

economic crisis played a role, but as Camp and others close to the US effort surely know, the other important
factor was the inexperienced and increasingly erratic trio running the non-profit Shanghai Expo, Inc. As
recently as last month, one of its members — Frank Lavin, a former US ambassador to Singapore and
Undersecretary of Commerce — issued a press release falsely claiming that the US Congress had "adopted" a
resolution in support of the US pavilion. This incident; and others like it, succeeded in alienating potential
donors (including major US corporations with operations in China), vast swaths of the US expatriate business
community in Shanghai, and — most crucially — members of the Shanghai government. For those of us
following the events, the question was no longer "How badly will the US damage its relationship with China if
it doesn't participate?" but instead became "What's worse for US-China relations? Turning down Shanghai's
Expo invite or continuing the current, incompetent effort?"
The July 1 appointment of Jose Villarreal as Commissioner General to the US pavilion effort seems to have
changed the equation. A lawyer with ties to the Clintons, Secretary of State Clinton empowered him to oversee
the US effort. He didn't waste any time, either, arriving in Shanghai on Monday, and managing to pull of the
signing on Friday. One person familiar with Villarreal's role described it as the arrival of an "adult" to a chaotic
situation that badly needed one. Indeed, if there's one telling detail to the handful of official and press accounts
of yesterday's signing, it's the total absence of the Shanghai Expo, Inc. members from the official comments
and photos (US Consulate coverage here; Shanghai government account here), none of whom live or work in
Shanghai, anyway. If that was a conscious decision, it was a wise one.
A final point. As Villarreal conceded, the US effort must still raise roughly half of its $61 million budget. I
suspect that — with Villarreal in charge of the effort — reluctant wallets will become less so. Regardless, though,
this raises a still unresolved question: namely, what are the actual fundraising rules for the US pavilion effort?
Back in 2007, the State Department indicated that it would not sign a participation agreement with Expo 2010,
Inc until all funds were raised for a pavilion. Apparently, that ill-conceived policy has changed. I say apparently
because, up until now, the State Department has refused to release the "action plan" that governs fundraising
and other rules related to the US pavilion in Shanghai. As a result of this official intransigence, a Freedom of
Information Act request has been filed to obtain this document(s?). Why the secrecy? It's anybody's guess, and
according to the State Department's FOIA office, we can keep guessing until Thanksgiving — it's around then
that they'll get around to releasing the documents.
[UPDATE: Just received notice that groundbreaking for the US pavilion will be on July 17 at 10:30 AM.
Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke will be present.]

Dear Nora,
Please pass along the following message to Cheryl.
Thanks,

Dear Cheryl,
Congratulations on the launch of the $20b G8 initiative. This will stand as a historic success of President Obama and
Secretary Clinton. Please do convey my personal congratulations and gratitude to Secretary Clinton if you have a
moment to do so. I know what a key role you personally played in bringing this to fruition.
I would like to suggest one overarching strategy for success.
Please do push hard on the donors (USAID included!) to pool the donor resources into one, at most two, multilateral
funding streams. Certainly the World Bank should be the main spigot, and IFAD possibly a second. By pooling the
resources, we'll cut down BY YEARS on the delays, donor negotiations, further talk, report writing, expert trips, etc., etc.,
which are now the biggest single threat to success of the initiative.
I look forward to a few minutes by phone or in person to offer some tips coming from long years of experience in this
sphere. This can be a real historic path-breaker, if it's not swallowed in the agencies!
Warm regards and kudos!
Jeff Sachs

Washington Post I A Dose of Realism in Honduras
By Edward Schumacher-Matos
Sunday, July 12, 2009
Sometimes you have to give political leaders credit.
President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton are on the verge of achieving their own coup in
Honduras and advancing American interests with a deftness not seen from Washington in many years.
The president's reference to Honduras during his trip to Moscow reflects how the small Central American
country is but a pawn as the administration pushes the reset button globally and in the hemisphere.
Justice may not be totally served in Honduras, but the country is likely to end up better off anyway.
"America cannot and should not seek to impose any system of government on any other country," Obama said
in Russia, "nor would we presume to choose which party or individual should run a country. . . . Even as we
meet here today, America supports now the restoration of the democratically elected president of Honduras,
even though he has strongly opposed American policies. We do so not because we agree with him. We do so
because we respect the universal principle that people should choose their own leaders."

The immediate lesson was to teach Russia to stay out of Georgia and Ukraine. The message, however, also
resonated throughout Latin America, undercutting the polarization efforts of Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez.
That the administration has joined with the Organization of American States in condemning the ouster of
Honduran President Manuel Zelaya has left Chavez puffing a lot of hot air with no one to fight against.
When three Chavez allies -- the presidents of Argentina, Ecuador and Paraguay -- sought unsuccessfully to
escort Zelaya back to Honduras on Venezuelan planes, they looked irresponsible for setting off violence that
resulted in one death. Clinton, meanwhile, working quietly with Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Chile and other
moderate countries, has brought the two opposing Honduran camps together in a mediation with one of the
grand old men of Latin America, Costa Rican Oscar Arias, a Nobel Peace laureate.
There is now genuine movement toward a peaceful resolution of the crisis.
The United States, long seen as a bully in the region, is suddenly being seen as respectful and wise. The
flummoxed Chavez could only come up with a patently hilarious formula in which the "Yankee empire" was
still the villain in Honduras but Obama may not be responsible because he is more like a prisoner of the
empire."
More fundamentally, Obama and Clinton, perhaps because neither is particularly experienced in Latin America,
have approached the region with fresh eyes and wonder what all the fuss is about. The Moscow speech and their
actions in Honduras underline that the Cold War really is over.
Chavez is a nuisance, but Washington has no enemies in Latin America. Our major interests are immigration,
crime and trade, not ideologies, as much as the extremists on the right and the left there and here might want to
make it so.
So, are we sacrificing Honduras? No. Zelaya is the main culprit in this crisis, but what counts is the rule of law.
His hand has been slapped very hard. Allowing him to serve out the last six months of his term while not
holding the referendum that would have opened the way to succession has a better chance of bringing peace and
stability to the country than the current standoff.
The bigger question will be: What have the rest of us learned? We have all been pushing Latin Americans to
uphold the rule of law, but beyond simply insisting that Zelaya was elected, few in the OAS, the European
Union or other critics have been willing to give much credence to Hondurans for trying to do just that.
The Honduran Supreme Court, as it is empowered to do under the constitution, ordered the army to arrest
Zelaya after he began to carry out a referendum for a constitutional convention that the court, Congress and his
own attorney general said was illegal. Yet, many Latin American and European governments still call it a
"military coup" or, as the Associated Press called it several days afterward, a "military power grab." Clinton and
Obama dropped calling it a coup.
There are gray areas having to do with presidential powers and the fact that the Honduran constitution prohibits
extradition of citizens. The army exiled Zelaya in consultation with civilian leaders to avoid precisely the sort of
violence seen when Zelaya tried to return. He forced the country and its institutions against the wall, and for
that he should take his medicine.

i like virtually everything in the two-pager, and I do agree with Tom on the notion of elevating the "national
interest" and security elements of this, both because those have become part of her "brand," and also to help
flesh it out in a way that both gives it the widest reach, and also protects it from attack.
some ways to consider doing that might be to just ensure that the overarching description of it "call out" the
national interest/security reasoning at work - something like "America has the opportunity and the responsibility
to lead in the creation of a network of principled partnerships that will serve our national interest, enhance our
security and build the capacity of people and nations to solve global problems and give everyone more power to
reach their potential."
(i inserted "network" of principled partnerships because i think it kind of alludes to both the diversity of the
kinds of partnerships as well as to the influence of technology on building them...not a "must have" but just a
thought... .in the same vein, i don't know whether there might be an advantage in alluding to a network of
"pragmatic and principled partnerships" or "practical and principled partnerships" just to ensure it's got that
pragmatism aspect of it sharply inserted).

I like the substance and I might consider if there are ways to communicate, or more strongly affirm, some elements that
would be important for audiences to hear, including that this is an approach of leadership, self-interest, and values. The
values I mean are things like security, stability and building opportunity. Those pieces are in here, but the notion should be
clear that we are not ceding leadership, we are leading by building alliances and partnerships. And we will always stand
for what is right and the right to defend ourselves and our allies, but we are fighting as we always have for shared values.
Make sense? Tom

Quick note to tell you the meeting ended today after lunch and it turned out to be a very positive event. To a person, the
heads of delegation were hugely complimentary. Good, very candid — even "frank" as the diplomats say -- level of
engagement, a lot of positive feeling and trust built up, an eagerness for this group to continue engaging and — perhaps —
make some progress. Dan Reifsnyder, an OES DAS who's been here a long time, said it was best meeting of this kind he
has seen in 20 years.
Issues still damnably difficult, but a pretty palpable sense in the room that something good had happened. Hearty
congrats from the Chinese, UK, Japanese, Aussies, EU, Danes, Swedes, South Africans, etc. Mike Froman did an
excellent job as Chair (I was head of U.S. delegation), and Steve Chu and John Holdren did very useful presentations
yesterday. Heads of delegation met with President in Blue Room for a reception late yesterday afternoon, which went
over big. Mike and I met with President in Oval beforehand. Reception at Kennedy Center in evening for whole
delegations, plus people from Hill, NG0s, etc., yesterday. Sen. Kerry spoke.
We followed up with a long bilateral with China and then a private dinner with the UK. More bilats tomorrow. Next
meeting of the Forum May 25-26 in Paris.
Many thanks to HRC for kicking it off in style.

I do think it provides a useful oppor for her to engage an imp group post her BIG Speech but the first day after such a

Cheryl,
Can you believe that I doubted you ????????? I am so, so embarrassed! It is June 28th and I am now just reading your
message of March 22d in response to my message of March 22d!!!
For three months I have been thinking that I must have done something unknowingly and stupidly to have offended you. I
have been struggling to remember what I might have done except to praise you too much!
I just feel so, so good, but also ashamed for having doubted you! I might be pathetic, but at least I am honest and
transparent!
(By the way, please extend SoS my best wishes for a speedy recovery.)

I am sorry to bother you on a weekend, but our mutual friend was kind enough to give me your email address and to suggest that I
send you a copy of the letter concerning INTERPOL that I have drafted for the SOS. Although I have finalized the draft, I can't put it
on INTERPOL letterhead until tomorrow.
The purpose of the letter is to seek a meeting with the SOS at a time and place of her choosing. I will be in Washington this Tuesday
and Wednesday which I know would be too soon to schedule a meeting. But, I can return on April 8th or thereafter if you believe that
a meeting would be possible.
In closing, you know me; so if my request has not been expressed in just the right way, please forgive me.
Let me know what you would like me to do next after reading my letter for the SOS which follows.
Best regards,
Ron
"Madame Secretary,
Under the Obama Presidency and your leadership at the U.S. State Department, the U.S. Government has shifted its strategic focus
from a predominantly military-led approach to one using "smart power" based on diplomacy, defense and development. The direction
you've chosen and the commitments you have made - to international organizations that advance collective security, to embracing and
implementing global solutions to security - are a vast improvement over prior policy and constitute the best approach to safeguarding
the United States and countries around the world against terrorism.
During my eight years as INTERPOL's Secretary General and based on having visited 123 countries to learn firsthand what their
security concerns were and how to best address them, my INTERPOL team and I have identified a number of serious global security
gaps which put Americans and citizens all over the world at risk to acts of terrorism and other serious crimes but which could be easily
closed. Surprisingly, and until now, no government has made INTERPOL and the role of international law enforcement in protecting
its citizens from acts of terrorism a real priority. Consequently, significant gaps in global security remain which require the immediate
attention of Heads of State or Ministers of State, Justice and Interior and the private sector.
These dangerous but resolvable problems include
1.The 850 million international arrivals that pass through the world's airports each year without being checked against the only global
database of over 10 million stolen and lost passports developed and managed by INTERPOL.
2.The culture which discourages countries from issuing international alerts when terrorists escape from prison.
3. The gap in policing where terrorists are arrested without their fingerprints and DNA profiles being compared against global
databases.
4. The failure of far too many countries to notify INTERPOL when their citizens' passports have been reported lost or stolen, which
significantly undermines any screening of passports used to enter the U.S. or other counties.
5. The lack of global anti-crime and anti-corruption centers, which leaves us under-protected against the scourge of human
trafficking, slavery, and other serious transnational crimes.
6. The absence of robust facilities world-wide where police can work, train and exchange information under the umbrella of
INTERPOL.
7. The threat to the rule of law that requires well-trained police at the national and international levels especially in post-conflict
areas like Afghanistan.
INTERPOL has launched its Global Security Initiative in order to enhance support for developing effective and growing programs in
each of these seven areas. Our capacity to address these threats can grow not only with greater resources but also with a larger
personal commitment to the kinds of policies that reflect the direction that you and President Obama have chosen in the name of
national security.
INTERPOL is a global international police organization with 187 member countries. Our Constitution prevents us from getting
involved in matters of a political, religious, military or racial nature. We have one goal and one goal only: to help law enforcement
worldwide keep their citizens and visitors to their country safe from terrorism and other forms of serious international crime.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762902 Date: 06/30/2015
Our successes over the last several years have been nothing short of extraordinary. More terrorists and dangerous international
criminals have been identified, located and arrested than ever before. The security of more borders has been enhanced. More police
information has been exchanged globally. More international pedophiles have been caught. More transnational crime groups have
been exposed.
Against the backdrop of this success, it remains the case that neither Heads of State nor Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Justice and
Interior have made the kind of investment in INTERPOL worldwide that can help to keep their citizens safe at home and
abroad. They should and you can be a leader among them.
It is my strong belief that in your capacity as U.S. Secretary of State, you can show the world that by making INTERPOL an integral
part of the U.S.'s new "smart power" strategy, all of the world's citizens will be safer than they otherwise would be. I would welcome
any opportunity to travel to Washington or anywhere in the world to meet with you to offer recommendations for solving the problems
outlined above and to discuss the range of resources required to meet these challenges.
Sincerely,
Ronald K. Noble
Secretary General
INTERPOL"

Folks: the secretary's video was a huge success. Thanks so much to our EAP team for getting it done and to the Manila
PAS team for getting it out on a holiday. It was a terrific message.
Am just leaving the Palace independence day fete (looking stiff in my filipiana) where the President grabbed me to say
"please thank Secretary Clinton for that wonderful message. No one has ever done that before and it really showed that
the United States cares about us". Secretary Romulo stopped me and said "I heard secretary Clinton's message over the
radio this morning and it was beautiful.".
Everyone from the gate guards to shopping mall vendors stopping me to say they saw/heard Secretary's message.
People are literally thrilled and stunned that our Secretary of State would reach out in such a personal fashion.
Bravo to all of you who made that happen.

I've been hearing really incredible feedback on the secretary's speech. One thing that people keep saying is that this is
the first time they can recall a secretary getting "technical" on the issue. Often times leaders just tell feel good
stories. I think we really took a big step forward by laying out our vision for food security through the seven areas of
focus and how we'll work through country-led processes like CAADP. People also really like how Megan made that great
connection between Ejeta's life work and our plan going forward. Megan did a great job laying out the lab to farm to
market to table. That's exactly what we're going for and what hasn't been articulated well in the past. Let's keep the
dialogue at a high level and really challenge people on this issue in the future – not just regurgitate USAID success stories
like we did during the Bush years!

Mission The U.S. Ambassador's Fund for Cultural Preservation, funded through the Diplomatic and Consular Program
appropriation, was established in FY 2001. The Ambassador's Fund for Cultural Preservation provides direct small grant
support to heritage preservatipn in developing countries, demonstrating U.S. respect for other cultures.
The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs administers the program awarding grants managed by U.S. Embassies in
eligible countries. Grants have ranged from $5,000 to $978,705. To date, the Ambassadors Fund for Cultural
Preservation has supported more than 500 projects worldwide, totaling $11.5 million. Funded projects include technical
support for the preservation of historic buildings and sites, museum collections and forms of traditional cultural
expression.
Priorities In FY 2008, U.S. Ambassadors in 94 of the 132 eligible countries in the developing world responded to the
call for proposals of projects supporting cultural preservation. A total of $4,731,431 was distributed in awards of grants
in 72 countries and $228,000 was spent on administrative costs.

Subject: RE: Honduran President Zelaya Reportedly Seized by Armed Forces
I am in the office and working with our Embassy in Tegucigalpa. Apparently, the action this morning was a coordinated
effort by the Supreme Court, the Honduran Congress, and the armed forces to prevent President Zelaya from holding a
non-binding poll on a possible constituent assembly. The Supreme Court determined the poll illegal and ordered the
military to collect all balloting materials. In the process of doing this, the military also seized Zelaya and supposedly sent
him by aircraft to Costa Rica.
Our Ambassador has his Emergency Action Committee convened at the Embassy. They are reaching out to all their
contacts to determine the current state of play. The Embassy will issue a warden message soon to U.S. citizens in
Honduras regarding events. I have called our Embassy in Costa Rica and asked it to confirm Zelaya's presence in San •
Jose. I will be calling the Costa Rican Foreign Minister soon. Tomorrow, Costa Rica takes over as President Pro Temp of
the Central American Integration System.
Hector Morales has been in touch with OAS SecGen Insulza. The OAS Permanent Council passed a resolution on Friday
offering its good offices to Honduras to resolve the political impasse, and Insulza was going to lead a team to Honduras
on Monday. We are checking to determine the state of play of the delegation, but OAS involvement will be key to a
successful resolution of this event.
I will also be calling the new SouthCom Commander to ensure a coordinated U.S. approach. We have big military
equities in Honduras through Joint Task Force Bravo at Soto Cano airbase.
We are working up press points now. Although this morning's events were part of a larger political and institutional
struggle in Honduras. The seizure and expulsion of the President was an intolerable act by the armed forces and we are
going to have to say this loud and clear.

According to conversations between A/S Shannon and the Honduran Ambassador, shots were fired outside of
President Zelaya's residence in Tegucigalpa, and members of the armed forces have reportedly seized the
President. U.S. Ambassador Llorens has received the same report in conversations with Zelaya's personal
secretary. Embassy Tegucigalpa is convening their EAC.

Jake:
S asked Tom and me in the hall this morning how we were doing on Honduras. We noted that we have been
working behind the scenes to encourage both sides in Honduras to accept the Arias proposal and to support a
confidence-building visit to Honduras by a group of trusted Central American foreign ministers to prepare the
ground for an Arias deal, including Zelaya's return under the Arias framework.
Today, Tom and I have been on the phone with the Centrals and others to continue this effort. One
blip: Micheletti publicly backed away today from his positive comments yesterday about the Arias plan. We
worked with the Panamanians to get this fixed and there are unconfirmed reports that M has corrected
himself. Meanwhile, the OAS meeting today turned into a non-event — just as we hoped. We want Arias out
front. We will keep at it.

Subject: Higher Education Dinner on August 17 - Proposed Guest List
HRC:
Below is the recommended guest list for the August 17 Education Dinner. I solicited input from Nina F, AMS,
and John. I think it's a good list but you should look through it — it's long (19) b/c there likely will be a large
number who will not be available in August given the academic calendar. We will work our way down it to get
12-14 outside attendees leaving about 6 seats for State.
The guest list includes university and college presidents, scholars, public intellectuals and journalists who have
thought creatively about the role higher education is playing and could play as part of "smart diplomacy".
Once you sign off on this guest list for invitations (so add or subject any), I will work with Anne-Marie to
discuss format and assignments for folks for speaking.

I'd like to add a community college leader like whom I know well or someone
else you can identify. Jill Biden gave a well-received speech about comm coils in Paris before a big international audience
and generated a lot of interest.
Also a lot of the higher ed in the developing world is church based and funded. The Methodists have started a large
university in Africa. There are other examples like the college in Lahore Lugar mentioned to me. We should have a rep of
this segment of higher ed operating in other countries.
And .
.works for the fastest growing college network in the world, Laureate Universities, started by Doug Becker
who Bill likes a lot. It's a for-profit model that should be represented.
Also one of the real world problems is getting more students into the US to study. Our typical costs are prohibitive. Beria
College in Kentucky, charges no tuition but requires all students to work and attracts a lot B6
of foreign students.

Subject: Hillary Consulted Republicans, Neocons, And Liberals For Big Foreign Policy Speech
The Plum Line
Greg Sargent's blog
Hillary Consulted Republicans, Neocons, And Liberals For Big
Foreign Policy Speech
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has consulted with a surprisingly diverse ideological bunch in the course of
creating the major foreign policy speech she plans to deliver tomorrow, including Republicans like Henry
Kissinger, Brent Scowcroft and George Schultz, and onetime neocons like Francis Fukuyama, a source familiar
with the speech-writing process tells me.
Hillary is set to deliver her high-profile speech at the Council on Foreign Relations, and is set to articulate her
own policy agenda, one focused on strengthening America's "smart power," according to The Politico. It could
help settle whether she has privately favored a more hawkish stance towards hostile foreign powers, as she
reportedly has.
The array of people she has consulted for this speech is striking in its diversity, boasting a notable array of
Republicans, foreign policy "realists" and hawkish voices. A partial list:
Henry Kissinger, Nixon's secretary of state; George Schultz, Reagan's secretary of state; Zbigniew
Brzezinski, Jimmy Carter's hawkish "realist" foreign policy adviser; Paul Farmer, a doctor and international
humanitarian; Joseph Nye, a major proponent of "soft power," the idea that persuasion and attraction can be
more effective than coercion; Francis Fukuyama, who helped drive the rise of neoconservatism; Brent
Scowcroft; the "realist" national security adviser under George H.W. Bush; Strobe Talbott, Clinton's deputy
secretary of state; John Podesta, the head of the liberal Center for American Progress; and Richard Lugar, the
Republican Senator who has praised Obama's response to the Iran crisis.
Hillary has also consulted with administration figures like President Obama himself, Defense Secretary Robert
Gates, and national security adviser James Jones.

Obviously there's someone here for everyone, and someone here for everyone to dislike, too. The array of
people she consulted strongly suggests that she views the speech as an extremely important moment for both the
Obama administration — and for her own tenure.

What Haiti Can Teach Us About Honduras
After Clinton backed Aristide, key Democrats went into business with the Haitian.
By MARY ANASTASIA O'GRADY
August 3, 2009
The Wall Street Journal
In October 1994, President Bill Clinton used the U.S. military to force Haiti to take back former President Jean Bertrand Aristide, an
intolerant populist who had been deposed in a coup three years earlier. The Haitian people didn't fare well under the decade of
Aristide tyranny and corruption following that U.S. intervention. But key Democrats, who secured contracts with the Haitian
government, did.
This sad chapter in U.S. foreign policy is a reminder of the immortal words of the French statesman Charles Talleyrand: "Countries
don't have friends, they have interests." The Clinton administration had interests in Haiti. And that fact is worth recalling as
President Barack Obama, defying all logic, insists that Castro-ally Manuel Zelaya be restored to the presidency in Honduras.
The democratically elected Aristide took office in February 1991. When the national legislature considered a no-confidence vote
against his prime minister, Rene Freya!, in August, he called on his supporters to take to the streets. The mobs set property on fire
and threatened members of the opposition. The Associated Press quoted the vice president of the Chamber of Deputies saying that
many representatives were "afraid to sleep in their own homes." After weeks of terror, Aristide was removed from office by the
military and went into exile in Washington.
Haiti's assets in the U.S. were frozen. But then-President George H. W. Bush released them to Aristide on the grounds that he was
the legitimate president. The largest source of hard currency was the income to the telephone monopoly, Haiti Teleco, from U.S.
carriers terminating phone traffic in the country. In the summer of 1994 Haiti's legislature claimed it had proof that as of April 15,
Aristide had drawn $49.9 million on the telephone account, which had originally contained $53 million.
Once restored to power, Aristide ruled Haiti for a decade, either as president or as the power behind the throne during the
presidency of Mr. Freyal. It wasn't until he was chased out of the country a second time, in 2004, that Haitians were able to
document that their government had been doing business in telecommunications with Americans who were close to Mr. Clinton.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05763204 Date: 07/31/2015
Haitians had been complaining to me since the late 1990s about the relationship between Haiti Teleco and a company called Fusion
Telecommunications. They alleged that Fusion had ties to Joseph P. Kennedy II, a vociferous supporter of Aristide, and that instead
of paying the official settlement rate that all U.S. carriers were supposed to pay, it was getting a special price. The company would
not even acknowledge that it operated in Haiti. What I did learn at that time was that Fusion was run by former Democratic Party
Finance Chairman Marvin Rosen. Mr. Kennedy was on the board. So too was Mr. Clinton's former aide, Thomas "Mack" McLarty,
and former Mississippi Democratic Gov. Ray Mabus.
The U.S.-Haiti telecom route is one of the busiest in the hemisphere. But weird things happened when I tried to learn about Fusion's
Haiti business.
Contracts with foreign monopolies are supposed to be public information at the Federal Communications Commission, but when I
asked for the Haiti file I was told it had gone missing. The FCC asked companies for duplicate copies of contracts so it could
recreate the public file. But Fusion went to court to keep me from seeing its agreement. I won that fight.
The Fusion contract shows that while the settlement rate for terminating calls to Haiti was 46 cents a minute, Fusion paid just 12
cents. When I saw the contract I immediately thought of how Haitian pleas for U.S. help during the decade of Aristide abuses went
unheeded. Then I thought of Talleyrand.
The Honduran constitutional crisis is very different than the Haiti case, in that the Honduran military has never been in charge.
When Mr. Zelaya was deported, the presidency was passed, as the constitution requires, to the president of Congress. Mr. Zelaya's
party is still governing the country.
Yet there are important lessons from Bill Clinton's Haiti policy that hold for Honduras. One is that the U.S. is more than capable of
misjudging a constitutional crisis and of backing the wrong guy. When it does, there is no guarantee it will rectify the problem.
Another lesson from Haiti is that a Caribbean despot can offer good terms to foreign investors. Since the Haiti episode Venezuela's
Hugo Chavez has conducted a courtship with Democrats too. He gives Mr. Kennedy's Citizen's Energy company cut-price home-
heating oil that the former Massachusetts congressman distributes to the poor in order to polish the Democrats' image. Never mind
about Venezuelans suffering under chavismo.
This is something to keep in mind as the Obama administration proposes that the U.S. embargo on Cuba be modified so Americans
can invest in its telecom sector. It's not clear how those contracts will be awarded. Or what one would have to do to raise the odds
of being considered in the running.

White House Counsel's Job at Stake
By BY EVAN PEREZ
WASHINGTON Obama administration officials are holding discussions that could result in White House
counsel Gregory Craig leaving his post, following a rocky tenure, people familiar with the matter said.
Mr. Craig, the top lawyer at the White House and a close aide to President Barack Obama, has helped lead the
administration's efforts on several national-security issues that once enjoyed popularity but have since become
become political liabilities for Mr. Obama.
View Full Image
President Barack Obama meets with White House counsel Gregory Craig, right, in the Oval Office in June.
These include the closure of the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the release of Bush administration-era
national-security documents, and efforts to find legal ways to indefinitely hold some detainees who can't be put
on trial.
The decision to close the Guantanamo facility became a political problem for Mr. Obama when concerns arose
that some of the detainees would be released into the U.S. and the public soured on the move.
Mr. Craig didn't respond to questions about his job as White House counsel for this article.
The people familiar with the matter said a final decision hasn't been made.
In a statement, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Jim Messina said: "We've addressed these rumors before.
They are nothing more than typical Washington parlor games. It's disappointing that while we are focused on

reviving the economy and fighting two wars, others spend their time pointing fingers in an attempt to promote
their own status."
Mr. Craig has come under criticism from inside the administration and in Congress for a perceived failure to
manage the political issues that have originated from Mr. Obama's decision to close Guantanamo, according to
officials in the administration and in Congress. This criticism has drawn focus away from president's priorities,
such as health care and energy.
One administration official involved in Guantanamo matters defended Mr. Craig, saying he has been responsive
and helpful when consulted. One member of Congress who has worked with Mr. Craig on detainee issues,
called Mr. Craig "a smart guy who understands Congress very well."
As an example of the difficulties Mr. Craig faced, the officials cite the president's move in May to reverse a
decision that would have led to the release of photos showing abuse of terror detainees during the Bush
administration.
Weeks earlier, Mr. Craig brought Mr. Obama plans to release Justice Department memorandums detailing the
Bush administration's policies on terrorism detainees. Some Obama national-security officials complained they
hadn't been consulted, people familiar with the matter said, and the objections prompted weeks of debate inside
the administration.
Mr. Craig and Attorney General Eric Holder won the fight to release the memorandums, with minimal
redactions, but the White House had to move quickly to limit political damage. Former Vice President Dick
Cheney sharpened criticism of Mr. Obama during a televised speech that followed Mr. Obama's own address
intended to explain his national-security vision.
At around the same time, the administration was running into trouble with plans to move to northern Virginia at
least some Chinese Muslim Uighurs who remain detained at Guantanamo despite being cleared for release. The
furor over the possible release of former suspects in the U.S. led Congress to overwhelmingly pass new
restrictions, including barring spending to close the Guantanamo prison.
Mr. Obama signed executive orders during his first week in office to close the Guantanamo prison, to review
the cases of the more than 200 detainees there and to draw up possible changes to detention and interrogation
policies.
At the time Mr. Obama enjoyed public support for his Guantanamo plans, polls showed. Six months later that
public support has dissipated, polls show.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), one of the administration's allies on the Guantanamo closure, faulted the White
House handling of Guantanamo. "Announcing the closure without a plan has put in jeopardy the ability to close
Guantanamo. Now public opinion has turned," Mr. Graham said Monday.
Mr. Craig, 64 years old, was with Williams & Connolly, a prominent Washington law firm, before joining the
Obama campaign. President Bill Clinton tapped him in 1998 to lead his defense during congressional
impeachment proceedings against the president.
Mr. Craig has built a White House counsel's office of formidable size, with 41 lawyers, according to the
administration's most recent filings. Mr. Bush left office with about 30 lawyers in his counsel's office.

In response to earlier questions about why he had built such a large office, Mr. Craig said: "We have the best
new law firm on the planet." He noted that the Obama administration faced an economic crisis and major
national-security issues.

Angola pledges $1.2 bin to farming, food security
LUANDA (Reuters) - Angola will invest an estimated $1.2 billion in agricultural development over
the next four years as part of a food security initiative, according to a government statement
published on Thursday.
The investment will be financed by a line of credit from the China Development Bank, private
investment and other loans, said the statement in the state-owned newspaper Jornal de Angola.
The plan is to take advantage of Angola's natural resources and bolster employment, the
government said. Angola was once a major food exporter but a 27-year civil war that ended in
2002 devastated the sector.
"The project also aims to guarantee food security, supply the internal market and take
advantage of local, regional and international 'opportunities," the statement said.
Angola, the world's fourth biggest coffee producer and a top exporter of sugarcane, bananas,
sisal and cotton before the 1975-2002 civil war, now imports much of its food from abroad.
This has helped push inflation in the capital Luanda to 13.95 percent year-on-year in June,
frustrating government plans to reduce it to 12.5 percent by the end of the year.
Luanda is also considered the world's most expensive city for foreigners, a study by London-
based human resources consultants ECA recently showed.

Observations
1. There is a considerable change in Indonesian attitudes toward the United States. The latest Pew Global Polls
indicate a 73% approval level; the last time it was nearly this level was only in the wake of the generous help
provided after the Tsunami disaster. Higher education officials warmly welcomed our trip and, more importantly,
are eager to increase student flows to America and institutional partnerships between U.S. and Indonesian
universities. The Director General for Higher Education (DGHE) has been given a special budget to promote this,
seven leading schools have been given special budgets by DGHE to explore partnerships, and the Ministry will
support a delegation of leading Indonesian educators and Rectors to visit the U.S. sometime in late fall/early
winter.
2. The Delegation represented over 30 colleges and universities arrived only 9 days after the terrorist bombing of
two hotels in Jakarta, which meant our Indonesian hosts deeply appreciated the show of solidarity we made by
coming. During our visit, the White House announced that President Obama would come to Jakarta in
November. The U.S. Ambassador arranged for the entire Country Team to brief us on our first day; we saw him
and his senior staff three more times during the week for substantive meetings, and he attended the farewell
dinner given by the Minister of Education. We were also scheduled to be received by President Susilo Bambang
Yudhoyono (SBY), who had to cancel at the last minute due to the onset of flu. Earlier in the week we were
hosted by his Spokesman.
3. Nearly every Indonesian senior official with whom we met had been educated in the United States. But many of
the officials just below that level had not had this chance. Some characterized this cohort as a lost generation
and the senior officials all spoke about providing opportunities for this group now (through a "re-charging" program
that the Government will fund) for short term study visits and about making sure that the next generation will now
have the chances that the most senior group once did to come to America for especially graduate education.
4. Indonesia, the 4th most populous country in the world, is the sixteenth-leading country of origin for students
coming to the U.S.; number 15 is Hong Kong (8200 students). A little more than 7600 Indonesians are currently
enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities. This is approximately half the number that were enrolled a decade
ago. The decline began in the wake of the Asian Economic Crisis of 1997 and accelerated after 2001 when there
were substantial visa issues and problems — coupled to a growing perception by Indonesians that America was an
unfriendly and not very welcoming country, especially for Muslims. At the same time, major campaigns were
launched by the governments of Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, China, Germany and the Netherlands to recruit
Indonesian students; today there are over 20,000 Indonesians studying in Australia alone. The appeal of these
countries also stems from the relative ease of applying to non-US higher education institutions and the willingness
to take students with low levels of English.

5. We did not hear a single visa complaint during our meetings and public forum. The U.S. embassy is on track to
issue a record number this year and now estimates that 80 percent of all student visa applications are being
granted.
6. The market for study abroad is probably very large. A recent poll by the Kompas newspaper found that 76.3% of
Indonesian students would prefer to go abroad for at least one degree. There are over 4.5 million final-year high
school students and 4.3 million currently enrolled in Indonesian universities, represent about a 17% enrollment
rate about the college-age cohort. The Government wants to raise this to 25% by 2011. This means adding over
400,000 new university students each year and doubling the size of the nation's entire teaching faculty. There are
approximately 154,000 faculty, but only 7% have any form of advance degrees and fewer than 5,000 have a
PhD. Capacity and quality challenges are huge.
7. We were repeatedly told that Higher Education is a top national priority and that the Government would like a
minimum international student enrollment of 5% in order to continue Indonesia's embrace of globalization nd
better prepare their students for work in a globalized world. A Higher Education Reform effort is just getting
underway, with initial emphasis on improving the quality and government support for science and
technology. There are over 2800 institutions of higher education, but only 86 public universities and
polytechnics. Enrollment in the public schools is about 1 million versus 3.4 million in private higher
education. The Government is coming to terms with how best to regulate the private sector; a recently-passed
law in Parliament calls for all private institutions to be brought under greater government control and oversight
over the next 6 years. All boards of trustees will by then have to report on their activities to a government
agency.
8. A very small number of Americans, 132 in 2006-2007, study abroad for credit and most do so on short term,
faculty-led study visits. The highest this number has ever been was only 215 (in 1994-1995). Most of the
delegation did not immediately see how they could send their students here for semester or year-long programs,
but an increasing number of courses are being taught in English at some leading universities. Almost all felt that
only Gadjah Made University in Yogyakarta was well set up to receive U.S. students and able to offer a significant
number of courses for them to take. Other institutions (especially in Bogor and possibly Bandung) offer promising
sites for field research in agriculture, environmental studies ,and marine science. Bali will remain an important
site for those in programs associated with the humanities and cultural studies.
9. Education Ministry officials stressed their desire to move rapidly to build on the momentum of this visit, create new
institutional partnerships, and expand educational programs under the official US-Indonesia Bilateral Partnership
proposed by President SBY (who went to the US six times during the course of his education and is a graduate of
Webster university) and endorsed by Secretary of State Clinton.

Huma,
As I mentioned to you both before, told me in our interview a couple of weeks ago that she was now B5
only interested in two jobs, both of which are out of reach: B6
and (name in play). I tried to interest her in other things at State and USAID,
but she also insists on SES status, which further limits her options given the freeze on SES positions at State. She didn't
seem interested in at any level.
She left saying that she was very disappointed that she hadn't gotten one of her two top preferences and that maybe
she should just stay in her current job, which she loves and which gives her much more money and status than we can
offer. Given her original aspirations for an Under or Assistant Secretary position, I can't imagine that she'd be happy as
for instance, if one were to open up. But let me know if you think she'd be more flexible in the
end.

Sensitive but Unclassified
New York City
• Jack raised the issue of a proposal from Senator Schumer to reimburse New York for the loss of property tax
revenue on diplomatic residences.
Jack said he would be glad to
call Schumer about this, and would like to intervene before this becomes a public dispute.
Merida Initiative
• Both Jack and Jim voiced misgivings over the current state of the Merida Initiative report needed for the release
of the last 15 percent of the allocated resources. Jim noted that, in effect, this is a certification. He said that
there is still insufficient transparency on the part of the Mexicans and that it is unclear that their proposal to try
alleged military human rights violations in military courts covers the full range of potential transgressions. Jim
said he would have a meeting later this morning to review with WHA, INL, H and others what needed to be
added, but the goal is to turn it around as quickly as possible and ensure that we do not lose out on the 15
percent.
Somalia
• Jack said that he had looked at the draft OFAC letter on humanitarian assistance to Somalia and thought it went
about as far as possible in addressing the concerns of USAID, short of granting a license in advance for any
actions that might inadvertently provide material support to terrorist groups. In essence, the OFAC letter tells
AID that they do not need authorization to proceed as they plan. The concern is that USAID may not be fully
satisfied and may try to re-litigate the issue. L was going to join AID in a meeting later today to discuss and
would seek to persuade them to accept the answer they had received from OFAC.
Colombia
• Jim voiced his displeasure over a cable from WHA on the proposed U.S.-Colombia Defense Cooperation
Agreement. I can provide you more details on the high side if you want, but in essence he noted that the policy
has not been fully thought out and that there needs to be a full policy review before we provide such guidance
to the field.
Honduras

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05763505 Date: 07/31/2015
• Jim asked me where we stood on the milair request for the OAS delegation to Honduras. I said everyone is on
board, but that the paper work has still not been blessed. Jim stressed that, contrary to SOUTHCOM plans, the
plane should not be a "blue and white" with United States of America boldly marked all over it, but rather a
regular white plane or other military aircraft. I undertook to convey this to all concerned.
Aung San Suu Kvi
• Jim noted that the Secretary had made a good statement on the decision to sentence ASSK to house arrest for
another 18 months, but stressed to PA the need for them to coordinate closely with the White House today on
what more we say.

I would be careful with the commercial farming. Many African leaders support it because it's good for their cronies.
Paul Collier has been one of the most vocal supporters of commercial farming - mostly because of the success of Brazil.
Our USAID colleagues are much less supportive because historically it doesn't have as much benefit for the poor as
working directly with rural farmers. I think the best way to frame this issue is to say: we support small holder farmers
and that's what our programs will emphasize; but, if we see an opportunity for commercial farms to also help achieve
our goal of lifting 100 million out of hunger and poverty, then we will support it. In general, commercial farms usually
benefit those who are above the poverty line - not those below it. Best, Matt

A few thoughts b/f I do:
1.S made commitments re angola and agriculture;
2.S agreed w/ nigerian agri min that we need to invest in commercial farming rather than only rural farming (several
countries have observed that focusing on rural farming has not worked but have offered no analysis for that but it was
said in several counties).

Sir:
10 received and disseminated the draft Honduras GA resolution, which Honduras has asked us to co-sponsor, this
evening. President Zelaya addresses the General Assembly tomorrow morning at 11:00 am, so USUN needs to be
instructed this evening.
The bureaus are happy to co-sponsor, as long as the resolution stays substantively the same. The draft text is below:

Cheryl —
Well, I finally made it. Quite a start to be able to ride in with the President in AF1 and then roll into meetings with
Calderon and the leadership of the Mexican government. I will spend this week in Mexico. I will be back next week to
pack out, but will also follow up on a number of other issues while I am there.
I wanted to ask if you thought it might be possible to get a bit of time with the Secretary. There are two requests going
through the system. One is for a formal swearing in. I understand that she has one swearing in at 4:00 on Monday in
the Ben Franklin room, so one option would be if she could do the same for me in the Treaty Room at 4:30. I know this
is short notice — this has been one of those cases where planning has alluded us.
The second request is for a meeting with the Secretary. I would very much appreciate the chance to go over priorities
moving forward, as well as provide a few initial observations.
Sorry to have to bother you with this. If it were not for the short timeframe
I would not want to trouble you with this kind of thing.
Many thanks,

North Korea frees detained South Korea worker
By KWANG-TAE KIM (AP) – 2 hours ago
SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea has freed a South Korean worker detained for months in the communist country,
officials said Thursday, brightening prospects for improved relations on the peninsula.
The release came days after Hyundai Group Chairwoman Hyun Jung-eun traveled to Pyongyang in an effort to secure the
employee's freedom, and a week after the isolated regime freed two U.S. journalists sentenced to 12 years of hard labor
for entering the North illegally in March. That release followed a surprise visit by former President Bill Clinton, who held
talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong II.
The 44-year-old technician, surnamed Yoo, worked at an industrial zone in the North's border city of Kaesong, where
about 110 South Korean-run factories employ about 40,000 North Korean workers. He was detained in March for
allegedly denouncing the North's political system.
Though one of the few joint projects still running, the complex's viability has come under questions in recent months as
the North refused to release Yoo and demanded a massive increase in payments and recent at the industrial park. It now
has only a skeletal South Korean staff.
Unification Ministry spokeswoman Lee Jong-joo said Yoo — an employee of the Hyundai Group's North Korean business
arm, Hyundai Asan — had been released and was expected to return to South Korea later Thursday.
"It's fortunate that Yoo is returning to his family, though it's rather late," presidential spokesman Lee Dong-kwan said in
a statement. He added that the South Korean government will maintain a "consistent policy" toward North Korea.

Lee did not elaborate, but South Korean President Lee Myung-bak's government has taken a hard-line approach toward
North Korea, and the North responded by cutting off most ties and halting or curtailing key joint projects except for the
Kaesong complex.
A council made up of South Korean companies operating in Kaesong welcomed Yoo's release and expressed hope it
would "improve frozen South-North relations and revitalize" the troubled complex.
The North, however, is still holding four South Korean fishermen whose boat was seized last month after straying
accidentally into northern waters. North Korea told the South earlier Thursday that its investigation into the case is still
continuing, Unification Ministry spokesman Chun Hae-sung told reporters. No details were given.
Ahead of the news of Yoo's release Thursday, about 100 demonstrators gathered in central Seoul to demand the release
of the detained worker and the fishermen. Some burned a North Korean flag and photos of Kim.
Hyundai has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the industrial zone and a joint tourist project promoted by more
liberal South Korean governments in the past. But renewed tension between the rivals has seen a suspension of trips to
the North by South Korean tourists and a dramatic reduction in the number of South Koreans working in the industrial
zone.
The two Koreas technically remain at war since the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended in a cease-fire, not a peace treaty.
Associated Press writer Hyung-jin Kim contributed to this report.

Preaching reform, Clinton wins African hearts
By DONNA BRYSON (AP) –1 hour ago
JOHANNESBURG — In Liberia, Hillary Clinton brought out the crowds despite torrential rain. In Congo, she came away
deeply shaken from a meeting with rape victims. Kenya's prime minister said Africa didn't need lectures from the West
about democracy, but Africa got one anyway.
At home, the U.S. secretary of state's visit may have been overshadowed by the aftermath of her husband's mission to
North Korea to bring home two imprisoned U.S. journalists. But on her seven-nation Africa tour, ending Friday with a
stopover in the West African island republic of Cape Verde, she made one splash after another.
Coupled with Barack Obama's visit last month, the two trips to Africa were the earliest into an administration by any
secretary of state or president, underlining Washington's pledges to pay more attention to the continent.

In the U.S., the headline-making moment of the trip was her testy response to a question about Bill Clinton. But in
Africa, it quickly became a footnote. What people wanted to hear was support for democracy, clean government and
ending its many civil wars.
Clinton's ambitious itinerary resembled those of China's foreign minister, who makes extensive annual tours of his
country's allies on the continent. But where China tends to sidestep the issues of corruption democracy, Clinton
confronted them head-on.
Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga, speaking hours before Clinton arrived, said Africa did not need to be lectured about
democracy. After they met, she did just that. "The absence of strong and effective democratic institutions has permitted
ongoing corruption, impunity, politically motivated violence and a lack of respect for a rule of law," Clinton said. "These
conditions ... are continuing to hold Kenya back."
Odinga switched to a more conciliatory tone, saying African countries could learn from Clinton's example when she
conceded defeat to Obama during the U.S. presidential primaries.
"That is a lesson Africa needs to learn seriously," he said. "In Africa, in many countries, elections are never won, they are
only rigged. The losers never accept that they lost. If we do this, we will be able to develop democracy truly in the
African continent."
In Angola, she told Foreign Minister Assuncao Afonso dos Anjos that his country needed to write a new constitution,
prosecute human rights crimes and hold a proper presidential election.
"So, Mr. Minister, we have our work cut out for us," she said.
And in Nigeria, Africa's biggest oil producer, she said "the disconnect between Nigeria's wealth and its poverty is a
failure of governance at the federal, state and local level."
To Africa's reformers, often an embattled minority, these were heartening words.
Emma Ezeazu, who campaigns for free and fair elections in his native Nigeria, said Clinton's visit showed that U.S.
officials "are becoming more pro-active in their relationship with Nigeria, in particular on the subject of governance and
democracy. They are paying more attention."
Tiseke Kasambala, a Johannesburg-based researcher for Human Rights Watch, commended her grasp of human rights
abuses in Africa — not just the headline-makers, like Zimbabwe and Congo, but the lesser publicized offenders such as
Angola.
In Goma, a Congo town in a region ravaged by gang rapes amid continuing fighting between army and rebels, Clinton
announced $17 million in American aid to help the victims.
She toured a squalid camp of 18,000 refugees and heard one of them tell her, "We really want to return home, that's
why we are asking America to help stop the fighting."
"That's why I'm here," Clinton replied. "I want you to be able to go home."
In Cape Town, South Africa, big, joyous crowds turned out for her at a housing project. In Liberia, founded in 1847 by
freed American slaves, rain-drenched crowds waved U.S. and Liberian flags at Clinton's motorcade.
The crowds in Nigeria and Angola were fewer, but community and religious leaders seemed excited just to be with
Clinton and be heard by her.

Nancy Kachingwe, a Malawian with the development group ActionAid, applauded Clinton's "very strong emphasis
around women's rights."
Some of former President George W. Bush's Africa initiatives, particularly on AIDS, have been widely praised in Africa.
But there were also sharp differences over world trade, global warming, and over the Bush administration's anti-
terrorism strategy.
Washington wants to buy Africa's oil and gain access to its markets, and fears instability in places like Somalia could fuel
anti-U.S. terrorism. Clinton won points by stressing that as the U.S. pursues its interests, it sees the virtue of "working
with and listening to our friends and allies, and creating not a multipolar world, but a multi-partner world."
Kachingwe said what matters now is the follow-up.
"There will be a positive impact" from Clinton's trip, she said. "But somewhere along the way, we do need to see ...
what's going to come to keep the momentum going."

We have had a brief but productive time here in Libya. Our visit here, inconceivable just a few
years ago, is another indication of the remarkable transformation of relations between our two
countries.
During our visit, we met with the National Security Advisor, with Col. Qadafi, and with a
number of advisors to the leader. We expressed our appreciation for Libya's decision to give up
its weapons of mass destruction programs and become a partner in the fight against violent
Islamic extremism, and discussed the ways in which relations between our countries can
continue on a positive and productive path. In particular, we discussed the possibility of
moving ahead with the provision of non-lethal defense equipment to the government of Libya.
As we move ahead with the many ways in which the United States and Libya can work closely
as partners, there remain areas where there remains real work to be done. The status of human
rights and political reform in Libya will remain a chief element of concern. In addition, we
understand that no final decision has been reached regarding the potential release from Scottish
prison of Abdel Basset al Megrahi, the man convicted of involvement in the bombing of Pan
Am Flight 103. Nevertheless, we made clear in our meetings with Libyan officials that we are
resolutely opposed to his release.
We encouraged our Libyan interlocutors to handle this case — which, after all, involves an
individual convicted of killing American citizens — in a fashion that will strengthen the growing
ties of friendship between our two countries, rather than hinder its progress.
We discussed these and other issues in a spirit of mutual respect and friendship. The ties
between the United States and Libya have taken a remarkable and positive turn in recent years,

COMMENT
Clinton can deliver a tough message to India
By Strobe Talbott
Published: July 16 2009 20:06
When Hillary Clinton arrives in India on Friday, the US secretary of state will no doubt
strike the upbeat tone that befits relations between the world's two largest
democracies. But she is expected also to engage her hosts candidly on two issues that
have been contentious in the past and may be in future: climate change and nuclear
non-proliferation.
In both areas, President Barack Obama's positions are radically different from his
predecessor's. Unlike George W. Bush, Mr Obama understands the need for a rules-
based international system that will regulate and reduce levels of greenhouse gas
emissions and nuclear weaponry. In particular, Mr Bush, like the Republican-controlled
US Senate of the late 1990s, opposed the Kyoto protocol on climate change and the
ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). He also had little use for the
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), even though it was largely an American
initiative going back to the dawn of the cold war.
Those Bush policies suited many Indians. In their view, a global regime to restrict
carbon emissions could hinder India's growth, while the CTBT and the NPT blocked
265

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05763800 Date: 06/30/2015
their right to develop the nuclear-weapons capability their government demonstrated
when it conducted a series of tests in 1998. Under Mr Bush, the US and India
negotiated a pact on co-operation in civil nuclear power that will, when the details of its
implementation are worked out, grant India an exemption from the terms of the NPT.
Mr Obama, however, is committed to ratifying the CTBT, strengthening the NPT, and
pursuing other treaties to prevent the spread of dangerous material and technology. He
also intends for the US to be part of the international effort to replace the Kyoto
protocol with a treaty-based climate-control regime including India, China and other
emerging powers.
As a result, on both proliferation and climate change, many Indians regard Mr Bush
with nostalgia and Mr Obama with muted apprehension. Mrs Clinton, however, is seen
as a staunch friend of India. Her trip there as first lady in 1995 helped break the ice in
US-Indian relations after 50 years of estrangement, paving the way for President Bill
Clinton's visit in 2000. She is therefore in an ideal position to deliver a message in New
Delhi that is both reassuring and cautionary.
The US administration knows it cannot coax or bully India into formally joining the NPT,
nor will it renege on the civil nuclear deal it inherited from Mr Bush. At the same time,
Washington policymakers hope that India's Congress party-led government, now that it
has been returned to power with an increased mandate, will join the US in tightening
the verification authorities of the International Atomic Energy Agency, accelerating
negotiations to stop the production of fissile material (the stuff at the core of nuclear
warheads) and bringing the CTBT into force.
These steps would make India's region safer, since Pakistan might follow suit in a
positive direction, just as it did in a negative one when it conducted a nuclear test
shortly after India's in 1998. A similar appeal to self-interest might prevail with respect
to climate change. Since much of India's population lives in rural and coastal areas, it
is acutely vulnerable to the devastation of agricultural lands and rising sea levels that
come with global warming.
Key figures in India are beginning to accept the idea of a global compact on climate
change. However, they are focused on the 12-to-1 disparity between the average
American's carbon footprint and the average Indian's. Therefore they want progress
towards parity in the final agreement. If the US achieves the 80 per cent cut in
emissions by 2050 that Mr Obama supports, the gap between the US and Indian
footprints per capita would shrink dramatically.
Indians (like many Americans) need to be persuaded to see the urgency of prompt
action. There are few voices more persuasive than that of the Indian scientist R. K.
Pachauri, the head of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change who shared the
2007 Nobel Peace Prize with Al Gore. He believes that the world has about six years

to impose drastic and effective reductions on greenhouse gases. That will only happen
if Mr Pachauri's and Mrs Clinton's governments can make common cause.

Dear Cheryl,
Congratulations on the launch of the $20b G8 initiative. This will stand as a historic success of President Obama and
Secretary Clinton. Please do convey my personal congratulations and gratitude to Secretary Clinton if you have a
moment to do so. I know what a key role you personally played in bringing this to fruition.
I would like to suggest one overarching strategy for success.
Please do push hard on the donors (USAID included!) to pool the donor resources into one, at most two, multilateral
funding streams. Certainly the World Bank should be the main spigot, and IFAD possibly a second. By pooling the
resources, we'll cut down BY YEARS on the delays, donor negotiations, further talk, report writing, expert trips, etc., etc.,
which are now the biggest single threat to success of the initiative.
I look forward to a few minutes by phone or in person to offer some tips coming from long years of experience in this
sphere. This can be a real historic path-breaker, if its not swallowed in the agencies!
Warm regards and kudos!
Jeff Sachs

Subject: Meeting with Honduran de factos
To All:
We spent about 90 minutes with the four de facto representatives. I invited them to make their points first
(they often complain that people don't listen to them). They focused on the abuses Zelaya committed before
June 28, pointing out that the San Jose Accord, while'key to a solution, would not restore the institutional
damage done to Honduras.
I said that clearly the San Jose Accords were necessary but not sufficient to clean up all the broken crockery in
Honduras. But they ARE necessary — and urgent. Only by implementing the agreement can Hondurans repair
the other damage with the support of the international community — which is essential for the country's
success. I then reviewed all the carrots and sticks we discussed this morning. I cited the Secretary in
underscoring urgency. Other countries join us, I emphasized, in seeing the mixed messages coming out of
Tegucigalpa as a deliberate delaying tactic designed to move the country toward elections without
Zelaya. The United States and others are losing patience with these tactics and want to see solid commitment
to the Accord now.
The de factos acknowledged that the world perceives them as delaying and that they need to move quickly. I
said they should commit publicly to the San Jose Accord when the OAS FMs are in Honduras next week. They
said that made sense.
Then they brought up another issue. The San Jose Accord grants political amnesty but not amnesty for other
crimes. They can arrest Z for corruption as soon as he returns to the country. I pushed back hard, saying no
one — Arias, the OAS, the United States — understands the San Jose Accord as leading to Z's immediate
arrest. The understanding is that he would resume limited functions with a national unity cabinet until he
hands over power to an elected successor. To say they will arrest Z is to ensure that he does not return, and
thus the collapse of the Arias plan. They seemed to back off slightly, but this remains a problem.
We are working already with other FMs and with Arias to make sure the de factos know this is a non-starter. I
plan to call the de facto delegation chief back Wednesday to cite my conversations tonight with others in the
region and urge him again to talk to Arias directly about this.
Meanwhile, we are pocketing their promise to agree asap to the San Jose Accord.

Cheryl,
In response to your query about the possibility of going to Goma, I reached out to our colleagues in Embassy Kinshasa to
see what has been done in the past. The only reasonably safe way to get to Goma is flying on a MONUC aircraft
originating from Kinshasa. That would mean a two hour flight each way, leaving a very small window (probably no more
than one hour) to work in events. Moreover, advancing Goma would pose a significant challenge for us for security
reasons.
I also asked the Embassy to look into other ways of traveling to Goma — perhaps over land via Kigali (Lew and I had
discussed this possibility earlier) — and the Embassy did not like the optics of approaching by land from another country.
We're still looking at ways to lengthen our time in Monrovia, including possibly staying overnight in another country,
such as Cape Verde. Still no luck, but we're working on it...km

Ex-U.S. Diplomat Talks With Hamas
Officials of Islamist Group See an Opening, but Washington Says Nothing's Changed
By Howard Schneider and Glenn Kessler
Washington Post Foreign Service
Thursday, July 16, 2009
JERUSALEM, July 15 -- To llamas officials Bassem Naim and Mahmoud al-Zahar, a recent meeting in
Switzerland with a former senior U.S. diplomat represented an opening in relations with the Obama
administration, and a path to easing the Islamist group's isolation.
"I hope it will be the beginning of addressing some of the mistakes of the last three years," Naim said of his
talks with Thomas R. Pickering, a former undersecretary of state and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
"This was a first meeting to investigate the positions in general terms of both parties without any commitment
on any side."
U.S. officials say they see the previously undisclosed June meeting between Pickering and the two senior
Hamas officials differently. They said Pickering had not been asked to approach llamas and had no official
standing; U.S. officials learned of the meeting only afterward. Policy toward the Islamist group, they said,
remains what it was under President George W. Bush: that llamas is a terrorist organization with which the
United States will not even sanction a meeting.
Before llamas can participate in peace talks, "we have made it clear, both publicly and privately, through all
kinds of pronouncements, that we would expect llamas to recognize Israel and renounce violence and agree to
abide by prior agreements," Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Wednesday in Washington.
Still, the Pickering meeting took place in the context of Obama administration efforts to reach out to forces in
the Middle East that were shunned under Bush. It was held in between President Obama's June 4 speech in
Cairo, in which he acknowledged popular support for llamas among Palestinians, and a June 25 speech by
llamas leader Khaled Meshal, in which Meshal said the armed movement was ready to deal with the
international community in order to reach an agreement with Israel. Pickering, co-chair of the nonprofit
International Crisis Group, would not comment.
As the Obama administration's Middle East diplomacy intensifies -- with U.S. officials jetting to capitals such
as Damascus that were off limits at the end of the Bush administration, and offering dialogue with Iran --
Hama remains one of the most significant outliers.

Hamas is, at once, a political party, a paramilitary group that targets Israeli civilians and troops, a provider of
charitable services, and a religious organization. The group seized control of the Gaza Strip in June 2007 in a
clash with the Fatah movement of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. The authority continues to
hold sway in the West Bank.
Even as Obama pushes for a renewal of talks between Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu,
there is no clear plan for how to address the presence of an organization that won 2006 Palestinian legislative
elections but does not recognize Israel and remains committed to armed insurrection against the Jewish state.
Israeli officials say that since their offensive in Gaza ended earlier this year, they have been focused on
preventing Hamas from rearming itself with smuggled or homemade weapons. Beyond that, U.S. and Israeli
strategy rests on a hope that improving the economy and security in the West Bank will undercut popular
support for llamas and strengthen Palestinian moderates.
"If we can energize that process, it will do more to delegitimize llamas than anything else," said Netanyahu
spokesman Mark Regev.
The International Monetary Fund reported Wednesday that recent changes in Israel's network of checkpoints, as
well as improvements in security, have put the West Bank economy on track for growth of as much as 7 percent
this year. Gaza's economy remains under an Israeli blockade, with unemployment estimated at 40 percent or
more.
In an interview after touring the West Bank this week, special Middle East envoy Tony Blair said that, if current
trends continue, llamas would soon "have a choice" as Gaza's 1.5 million residents slip further behind
Palestinians in the West Bank.
A recent lull in rocket fire and other attacks, coupled with Meshal's speech and a visit to Gaza by former U.S.
president Jimmy Carter, has led to speculation that llamas is trying to earn a place at the negotiating table.
Others argue that the group is simply pausing to rearm and will never accept the conditions laid out by the
United States and others -- including a renunciation of violence and acceptance of earlier Palestinian
agreements acknowledging Israel.
Yuval Diskin, head of Israel's internal security organization, Shin Bet, said at a closed briefing in May that he
saw practically no chance of a political compromise and that Israel would ultimately have to overthrow Hamas
in Gaza, according to an account of his comments provided by someone who attended the briefing.
Meshal's speech, delivered from Damascus, the Syrian capital, was considered an overture to Obama. "The
purpose of the speech was to convince the West that llamas is a partner for dialogue," retired Israeli Brig. Gen.
Shlomo I3rom, director of the Israeli-Palestinian Relations Program at Tel Aviv University, wrote in a recent
paper. "The speech will make it easier for elements in Western Europe and within Obama's administration that
support dialogue with llamas to advance their position."
But U.S. and Israeli officials say they see little substantive change in Meshal's position. Meshal and other
llamas officials have said that hostilities might end for a decade or more through an extended truce, but that
they are not interested in reconciling with Israel over the long term.
"There is a recognition that Israel exists," said Omar Abdel-Razeq, who was elected to the Palestinian
Legislative Council from llamas in 2006 and was recently released from Israeli prison. "The recognition of its
right to exist is another matter. I don't think time lies on the Israeli side. What if the balance of power shifts?"

Colleagues,
Ambassador Llorens provided a readout of CODEL Mack's trip to Honduras. During the weekend trip, U.S.
Representatives Mack and Bilbray met with several Honduran officials, including Micheletti, the Supreme Court
president, and six presidential candidates. It is Ambassador Llorens' opinion the CODEL was not helpful to the Obama
Administration's goals in Honduras. The CODEL already has departed and is en route back to the United States.

ALL: We've spent the better part of the weekend with CODEL Mack (Rep. Mack and Rep. Bilbray). Prior to their arrival
announcement on Friday, Mack staffers had already made a number of appointments on their own. However, the
Embassy provided full logistical support and security, and set up a number of other appointinents where it was
appropriate for Embassy officials to participate consistent with our non-contact policy. The CODEL arrived at mid-day
yesterday. I hosted a country team briefing over lunch at the Residence. They made clear that they were in strong
disagreement with many aspect of our (Administration) policy on Honduras, but they did hear us out on our perspective
on the situation since the coup. Following the country team briefing, the CODEL went to the Presidential Palace to meet
with de facto regime President Micheletti. No Embassy staff was present or involved in that meeting, although we
provided the CODEL with security and transportation. Following the 90-minute session with M, the CODEL returned to
the Residence and met with Supreme Court President Rivera and several of the court magistrates. The Rivera discussed
his views on the legal aspects of the coup. He made the case that the process involving the Attorney General and the
Supreme Court was legal, although he acknowledged that by extraditing President Zelaya the military had disregarded
Court instructions and its issuance of an arrest warrant. The Honduran court members found a very receptive CODEL to
their arguments. The CODEL then stayed at the Residence for a meeting with a group of legislators. We had five
members of the Honduran National Congress representing three political parties. Three of the members were
supportive of Micheletti and two were strongly opposed to the coup. In a very interesting debate, former Minister of
Defense Orellana (a Liberal Congressmen who resigned following the coup) won the debate making a very powerful
presentation arguing that the events of June 28 were unquestionably a coup. Orellana's arguments for very muck track
with ours, and I believe this meeting had an impact on both Rep. Mack and Rep. Bilbray views about the coup. I am
convinced they came out of this meeting much more aware of the serious legal flaws in the regime's case that the coup
was constitutional.
The CODEL returned to their hotel where they met with a group of U.S. and Honduran business leaders to discuss the
current situation. We were not asked to participate in this event. The CODEL returned this morning to the Residence
for a breakfast I hosted with six of the country's presidential candidates. This was a an interesting session and allowed
for a review of the political situation and a look at possible ways forward. In the meeting Bilbray laid out the CODEL's
perspectives and the message they planned to take back to the Hill and to the Administration. Both stated that they
supported the idea of a negotiated solution under the Arias mediation. However, they said they would advocate an
agreement that would call for Micheletti's resignation, but not the restitution of Z. The CODEL's proposal was for some
type of constitutional succession involving the President of the Supreme Court as Micheletti's successor. Following this
meeting, the CODEL met with Pastor Anderson, a U.S. religious and social worker here. He was accompanied by several
Honduran human rights workers who made a cogent case that the human rights situation in Honduras had deteriorated
significantly since the June 28 coup.
The CODEL left for the airport about an hour ago. This CODEL was friendly and professional, but they certainly were not
helpful to Administration policy goals in Honduras. The CODEL sent a strong message of support for the Micheletti
regime. The meeting of the CODEL with Micheletti received prominent press coverage by the establishment media,
which are mostly in the anti-Zelaya camp.
As usual, our staff did a splendid job handling all aspects of this short fused visit. We will report the details of the CODEL
via front channel message.

Text of attachment below:

From: Lou de Baca, G/TIP
Re: Child Trafficking in Haiti: the Restavek Problem
Date: July 26, 2009
Just before I left for Africa, the Secretary asked that I send you and her a short memo on the
restavek problem that she could share with President Clinton in his role as Haiti envoy. The
Haiti country narrative from the annual trafficking report is also attached to this short memo as
an appendix.
I wanted to make sure that you had this before you travel to Haiti this week. I'm also sending
over a copy of A Crime So Monstrous, by investigative `reporter Ben Skinner, who did some
undercover work in Haiti on child slavery and in fact negotiated the purchase of a child in just a
few short hours. I understand that will be joining you for the trip — she has been B6
increasingly active in the slavery/trafficking arena, and is enthusiastic about engaging with us
on the issue.
Background
Haitian parents unable to care for their children have traditionally sent them away from home,
to relatives or strangers who are expected to provide the children with food, shelter, and an
education in exchange for housework. Children given or sold into this system are known as
restaveks, a Creole term based on the French "restez avec" ("stay with"). While some restaveks
are cared for by their host families and sent to school, most of these children are subjected to
years of hardship, abuse, and involuntary domestic servitude. At one time the practice may
have benefitted both child and the host family, but for most restaveks it is now a modern form
of slavery.
The roots of the restavek system reach back generations, and mirror involuntary child domestic
servitude patterns in West Africa. The practice is so entrenched in Haitian society that it is not
limited to the upper classes -- poor families routinely keep one or more restaveks who come
from even poorer families.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05763959 Date: 07/31/2015
Estimates from NGOs and the Haitian government of the number of restaveks in the country
run from 90,000 to 300,000, the majority of whom are girls between the ages of six and
14. NGOs believe another 3,000 Haitian restaveks are in the Dominican Republic. Exploited
restaveks in either country typically work excessive hours on physically demanding tasks
without pay or adequate food, do not attend school, and are often physically and sexually
abused by their host family.
On average, parents offer their children to host families when they are as young as six. Girls
are primarily trafficked into private homes in the city, while boys more often end up exploited
for labor on farms.
Restaveks who do not run away or escape usually remain with the host family until they are 14-
years old; Haitian labor laws require employers to pay domestic workers over 15 years old, so
many host families force restaveks out of the household before that age. Abandoned and
runaway restaveks make up a significant proportion of the large population of children living on
the street, where most are forced into prostitution or street crime by violent criminal gangs. The
restavek system thus has a destabilizing effect far beyond the individuals involved.
Some restaveks do escape, and those who are picked up by the authorities are referred to the
social welfare organization IBESR (Institut pour le bien-etre social et la recherche), and then
temporarily cared for in dedicated shelters. Two centers in Port au Prince receive financial and
technical support from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) to provide shelter,
food, medical and psychosocial services for these children until their parents can be found and
conditions are in place for the children to return to their families.
The shelter's capacity is limited, however, and the rescued children cannot always return to
their families. Since 2005, IOM has only been able to assist about 300 children.
Action Needed:
The permanent demise of the restavek system cannot come about without overhauling both the
Haitian legal system -- which does not prohibit or punish this form of modern slavery -- and the
historical institutions and attitudes which support it.
Some of these changes are already in process, although without long-term international support
they are likely to prove fruitless. The UN, USAID, World Bank, IOM, US Institute of Peace,
and other reputable organizations currently conduct rule-of-law and legal reform assistance
programs that seek in part to revise Haiti's criminal laws, which have been in place relatively
untouched since 1826.
Most programs plan to develop a new legal structure that is easy for the general public to
understand, fosters trust in the government, and develop a culture of the rule of law. This
overall structure could allow for the development of effective specific legislation which not

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05763959 Date: 07/31/2015
only prohibits the restavek practice in all forms as well as the abuse, exploitation, or
enslavement of any child or adult.
Prospects for this specific anti-trafficking outcome, however, may hinge on donors' inclusion of
specific goals addressing the restavek problem in their broader rule of law and legal reform
programs. A parallel donor effort to aid to the Haitian police child protection unit — the Brigade
for the Protection of Minors — would boost the Haitian government's capacity to investigate and
punish the exploitation of these child slaves.
G/TIP Activities in Haiti
Last month, G/TIP funded the International Organization for Migration ($315,000) and we are
in the process of awarding to the NGO Free the Slaves/Anti-Slavery International a grant of
$200,000 to address the needs of some child trafficking victims. The Free the Slaves project
will include the disbursement of micro-grants and training of parents, while increasing public
awareness of trafficking and gathering data on trafficking issues in Haiti. This project will
partner with the local NGO Fondasyon Limy& Lavi (Light of Life Foundation), which has done
groundbreaking work against this practice.
In the past, G/TIP funded the Pan-American Development Foundation, complementing separate
funding from USAID, for work in preventing cross border trafficking from Haiti to the
Dominican Republic.

Cheryl, Jake:
Despite the nailbiting finale, the Human Rights Council reentry has been remarkably successful. The tally, with returns
still coming in:
1. Goldstone-report deferred through extraordinary political work by all of you 2. Freedom of Expression--tonsensus--a
landmark achievement in suggesting that there is indeed a universal understanding of freedom of expression that can
cut across cultural lines 3. Honduras: consensus 4. Womens' Equality-consensus 5. Human Security issues: US took
forward leaning posture USG engaged across the board and got the results it wanted--5 for 5--plus appeared principled
and balanced To be honest if we had gotten any 2 of these, I would have felt relieved. Instead we ran the table. There
was a stunning performance by 10-DRL-L-AmEmbassy Geneva and various regional bureaus, particularly NEA and WHA
and AF, as well as EUR. The State Department at its finest and multilateral diplomacy executed at a macro and micro
level. Brimmer, Nossel, Posner all were outstanding as were our folks in Geneva.
And this is in our first reengagement. It should get better as we gain more experience.

I couldn't agree more. It should be a letter, and we shouldn't be too defensive.
This is a time-worn tactic of the GOSL: have a conniption when someone says something you don't like, characterize the
statement in the worst possible way (never mind that she also referred to the Balkans and nobody from Bosnia or Serbia
is making a fuss) and force the other side to back down, abjectly.

A letter from Melanne that makes its way into the public domain achieves the same goal of putting out a countering
narrative to whatever handful of outlets have covered this.
But coming from Melanne it is far more confirming of HRC's statement, as opposed to a widely released spokesman
statement which will invariably read like a correction/retraction. I fear how the 3,000 outlets who have not even noticed
this issue will react to this statement.
And with a letter from Melanne, the Sri Lankans still get a response - arguable a more substantive one

Jake, I was in this same place an hour ago when we had a conference call with the Secretary. She feels that this has
generated a great deal of media commentary in various quarters, including prominent outlets in this country (LAT) and
in Asia that we have no choice but to respond in a public way. Government supporters are saying that she is listening to
the Tamil diaspora. What this does is reinforces her statement, but gives the government a little something on recent
experience, and then does the pivot to reconciliation and what they need to do now, reinforcing our current policy.

Having the spokesman clarify the Secretary's words in an official statement has a slightly uncomfortable feel to it. It

STATEMENT BY THE SPOKESMAN
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in remarks Wednesday before the United Nations Security Council on the adoption of a
resolution to combat sexual violence in armed conflict, stated that we have seen rape used as a tactic before in a
number of countries. In her statement, she specifically cited Sri Lanka, which prompted an official protest by the
Government of Sri Lanka and some news commentary around the world.
Regarding the Secretary's reference to Sri Lanka in her address, we want to be clear. Over the course of the difficult
conflict between the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), stretching well into this
decade, the State Department as well as credible human rights organizations substantiated numerous reports of rape
and sexual violence in Sri Lanka, particularly acts committed against women held in detention by the government. At the
same time, in the most recent phase of the conflict, from 2006 to 2009, though we remained deeply concerned about
reports of extrajudicial killings, disappearances and mistreatment of detainees, we have not received reports that rape
and sexual abuse were used as tools of war, as they clearly have in other conflict areas around the world. We hope that
this clarification puts the issue in its proper context.
This controversy should not detract from the specific actions that Sri Lanka needs to take now. With the end of the
military conflict, Secretary Clinton believes strongly that Sri Lanka must focus to the future and move forward on the
promotion of peace and the protection of human rights. The government of Sri Lanka should release more than 250,000
displaced persons who are still confined in camps, and lead a process of genuine political and social reconciliation that
changes how the Sinhalese and Tamil people relate to each other. The United States stands ready to assist and support
the people of Sri Lanka with these critical challenges.

A New Approach for Missile Defense
By Hillary Onion
Iran's development of short- and medium-range ballistic missiles poses a clear and growing threat to the security of our
European allies and our own forces stationed in the region. That is why President Obama announced yesterday that the
United States is ready to deploy missile defenses in Europe specifically geared toward stopping these missiles. This is a
threat we cannot ignore.
Previous missile defense efforts have focused on protecting against intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching
the Jnited States, but our intelligence now shows that the threat from these long-range weapons has not progressed as
quickly as had been feared. In contrast, evidence indicates that Iran is developing short- and medium- range missiles
that will eventually enable it to target most of Europe, the Caucuses and the Middle East, including U.S. and NATO
forces.
We deeply appreciate the willingness of the Czech and Polish Governments to host the original missile defense
architecture on their soil, and the decision to deploy other systems to better meet this growing threat came as a result
ofa long and careful review of our policies, capabilities, and requirements. This decision does not alter the unshakeable
commitment of the United States to the security of these vital NATO allies. Rather, it reflects our determination to
jointly meet the threats that endanger us all.
The old focus on long-range missile defense systems left significant gaps in our ability to defend against shorter-range
threats, exposing our allies and our forces stationed in Europe. Many experts have also expressed concerns about the
testing record and effectiveness of the long-range interceptors that were to be deployed in Poland.
Our ile\p:/ approacri is different in a number of ways.
First, we will use well-tested missile defense systems, such as the Standard Missile-3, against the current threats. And
unlike the old fixed, silo-based interceptors, they will be mobile and able to shift as threats evolve.

Second, while previous efforts sought to by-pass NATO in favor of bilateral agreements, the Obama Administration plans
to make coordination with NATO a central element of our approach. By working with our allies to build a workable and
cost-effective missile defense system in Europe, we can better contribute to the protection of our NATO allies and
increase regional stability.
For 60 years, the NATO alliance has been a force for peace, prosperity and security in Europe and around the world
because of its commitment to collective security: an attack on one ally is an attack on all. An attack on London or
Warsaw is an attack on New York or Washington. NATO demonstrated this commitment after the September 11
terrorist attacks, when for the first time, the alliance invoked Article V and NATO sent assets to the United States to help
protect us from additional terrorist attacks.
UnfoJunately, the old long-range defense plan created the impression of "two-tiers" of security within the alliance by
focusing only on theoretical threats that could one day affect the mainland United States, while leaving our European
allies vulnerable to very real short- and medium-range missiles.
Our new plan corrects this imbalance. We will continue to monitor and counter longer-term threats, but we will work
with our allies to protect all NATO territory. We will focus on the most imminent threat, while also developing the
capacity to adjust quickly if the threat evolves.
Finally, we will engage with Russia as part of our new approach. Russia is also vulnerable to Iran's short- and medium-
range missiles and we will seek to cooperate to address this common threat. I am pleased that the Russians agreed at
the Moscow Summit to isi joint threat assessment of the ballistic missile challenges of the 21st century, including from
Iran. This is a positive first step and I look forward to future progress.
. In short, this hew missile defense plan is more realistic about the threats we face, more reliable in the tools we will use,
and more inclusive of the allies we are pledged to protect.
While we pii1SUE this new path, we will also redouble our diplomatic efforts to engage Iran and focus its leaders on a
clear choice: whether to join the international community as a responsible member or to continue down a path to
further isolation.
But the security of our allies and our forces cannot wait. That is why we are moving ahead with a new approach for
missile defense.

Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is a liar and a troublemaker. Congressmen and columnists can say this, but
President Obama is correct not to do so, even though his critics want a tougher U.S. policy against the Venezuelan.
A testament to the success of diplomatic finesse is that Chavez and his pan-regional socialist dreams have been losing
ground in Latin America since the inauguration of Obama and his appointment of Hillary Clinton as secretary of state.
In the past week alone, two Chavez allies have broken ranks. Ecuador and Venezuela were teamed against neighboring
Colombia over a guerrilla war there. But Ecuadoran President Rafael Correa has just accepted an olive branch offered by
Colombian President Alvaro Uribe.

Ecuador's vice president went so far as to add that his country would not let Chavez drag it into war with Colombia, and its
defense minister snubbed a renewed Venezuelan attempt to classify Colombia's FARC guerrillas as legitimate state
actors. The minister said that Ecuador had "zero tolerance" for the FARC. While Venezuela clearly harbors and funnels
arms to the FARC -- despite Chavez's patently false denials -- American and Colombian officials say that Ecuador has
been cracking down on the guerrillas along its border. A Colombian raid of a FARC camp inside Ecuador in 2008 led to a
rupture in relations between the two countries.
Meanwhile, the Paraguayan Congress forced leftist President Fernando Lugo to withdraw a bill that would have allowed
Venezuela to join the Mercosur trade pact that also includes Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay. Brazil had rejected
Venezuelan membership last year.
In Honduras, the Chavez-led move to restore his friend Manuel Zelaya as president has been losing steam as much of the
"rest of the continent has come to grudgingly accept that Zelaya was at least partly to blame for forcing a constitutional
crisis. His ouster was hardly a standard coup. The military sent him out of the country after the Supreme Court ordered his
arrest for violating the constitution. Zelaya was attempting to follow Chavez's demagogic example of using plebiscites to
gut the country's dernocratic institutions. The de facto civilian government there continues to insist that it will allow
Zelaya's return only to stand trial.
Chavez's allies in Argentina, President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and her husband, recently lost congressional
elections and are now minority lame ducks in that country. This reduces Chavez's greatest influence to two small
countries -- Bolivia and Nicaragua. Further limiting him is that Venezuelan economic ills and mismanaged oil reserves
have sharply curtailed his largess. He has provided only $6 billion in foreign assistance this year, compared with $79
billion last year.
A crucial test of Chavez's influence will come when Unasur, a new Brazilian-led association of South American presidents,
meets next week in Buenos Aires. The emergency session was called to respond to the expanded use of Colombian
military bases by American forces that was agreed to in principle this week.
Chavez condemns the agreement as a threat to him and the region, citing past American interventions. The final details
are still being negotiated, but Obama, Clinton and Uribe insist that the 10-year agreement is merely an extension of the
existing training and intelligence-gathering to fight drugs and guerrillas under Plan Colombia. There will be no offensive
U.S. weapons such as F-16 fighter aircraft or combat units stationed in Colombia, and no change in the current force cap
there of 1,400 Americans, they say. By clumsily working in secrecy, however, the negotiators allowed leaks to frame the
project as an American plan, and not as the Colombian idea it largely was.
The administration has been winning over the Brazilians and other key players, though just how much remains to be seen.
Still, the declining influence of Chavez and possible regional acceptance of the Colombian agreement are due in large
part to the administration's adept ability to extend an open hand and attentive ear to all, even Chavez, and thus not play
into Latin fears of a Yanqui bully. It has won influence by going along with the rest of the hemisphere in condemning
Zelaya's ouster and in making overtures to Cuba, while staying true to American democratic values.

Critics who demand bellicose policies that might lead to a break in relations with Venezuela should look at the failure of
such policies to sway events in Cuba, Iran, North Korea and prewar Iraq. Chavez is a nuisance but not a threat to the
United States, and he has to be treated with the hemisphere in mind. So far, Obama and Clinton are doing just fine.

Hi Cheryl,
Thanks for your email. I am on a plane now — headed back from Istambul. I have not has any time to address this. But I
will certainly work on it shortly. And in fact am meeting with David this week to do so.
But I also think it is essential to take into account the concerns of the Hill. In Jose's hearings and mine, the committee
quite explicitly and directly said they expected us to play significant roles in energy. David should certainly have the lead
role, as the secretary has said and as the legislation clearly spells out, but we also need to figure out how we can work
together. And I am sure that can be done amicably under david's overall leadership in this area. But H should be
consulted and talk to the SFRC before any changes are made to avoid any surprises and be sure they understand what is
being done. And, of course, I want to be sure we bring in Jose on any discussions, since he has important interests in this.
Regards,
Bob

I hope you are settling in — looking forward to finding a moment to connect with you. I particularly want to make sure
we follow-up on energy in your title and making sure lines are clear in that arena to avoid any dropped balls or missed
opportunities.
I wanted to flag one matter now because the Secretary has asked David Goldwyn during her look-ahead meeting
regarding energy, to move forward on several energy security priorities — including engaging with key producers like
Brazil, Mexico, Angola and Nigeria as well as addressing energy security concerns with consumers like China and India.
Given that E/EEB previously had the lead on energy matters before we had an International Energy Coordinator, I want
to make sure you and he are properly and smoothly transitioning matters to him.

One example I know is pending that I discussed yesterday with the Secretary is Brazil. I know David will need to leverage
our engagement on biofuels with Brazil, to take up issues that may be more challenging, like Brazil's hydrocarbons
framework. Are you all making appropriate transitions on this?
Before I reach out to David, can you advise where things stand in this regard?

Subject: AMCIT suspected of abuse of minors in Liberia
Cheryl: My staff assistance received a call from the "Line" saying you might want a short informal note to send to the
Secretary on the situation with the American UNMIL employee suspected of abusing minors in Liberia. Below is a
shorter and updated version of what I sent you earlier. I will be on leave for a week beginning tomorrow and one my
deputies, Bill Fitzgerald, will be following this issue in my absence. Regards, Johnnie
An American citizen civilian employee of the UN operation in Liberia is suspected of engaging in illegal acts with at least
two underage Liberian girls. The Liberian National Police, who received a DVD of the acts, told Embassy officials earlier
today they had identified the American citizen and confirmed the identity of two girls—an 11-year-old and another
between 12-15 years of age. These are crimes in Liberia as well as in the United States.
We are working with Liberian authorities and the UN to ensure that the American citizen is made to answer for these
allegations. In the meantime, the Department is working with Department of Justice lawyers to determine if the
American citizen can be tried in the United States. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, currently in the Department
chairing a promotion panel, has spoken to President Johnson-Sirleaf about the importance of this case. It appears that
the UN will waive any immunity the American may have and that the Liberians will take the American citizen into
custody.
Coming on the heels of your trip to Africa, and the emphasis you placed on gender-based violence and sex crimes, we
are making every effort to ensure that this individual is brought to justice, including by offering whatever resources the
Liberians need to conduct the best possible investigation. The Legal Attache, based in Freetown, is currently en route to
Liberia to assist.

Great news--
The video that S taped this am will likely kick off the World Food Prize conference. I will also coordinate with Katie to
make sure we get this up on the website.
Below is more info on its likely placement from the team at the World Food Prize.
"We would like to show the Secretary's remarks at the outset of the symposium on the afternoon of Wednesday,
October 14. The symposium begins at 1 p.m. with about 15-20 minutes of introductory comments by Ambassador
Quinn. He would incorporate the video into this opening as her remarks tie together so many of the themes so
perfectly. Dr. Ejeta will be on stage at the time; it would be a great moment to honor him, to remember Dr. Borlaug,
and to have the Secretary's message foreground the discussions that will follow. (For your reference, the 3 opening
keynotes will be delivered by ADM CEO Patricia Woertz, DuPont CEO Ellen Kul!man, and Dutch Minister of Agriculture
Gerda Verburg.)"

Cheryl
Hope this finds you well. I wanted to update you on the success of the video and also share a new idea with you. Give
the statistical results below, I honestly believe this is the State Departments first ever successful instance of policy
advocacy via viral video and the impact we have raised is worth noting. I have heard comments from all over the
building and outside that this is a new level of creating content/video that is engaging, interesting, educating and that
can have long term value for State and partners to use. Bottom-line, we have done something new in raising
awareness/attention on a major foreign policy initiative through compelling, and viral video -- the Department of State
has raised the bar.
It is hard to read the traffic exactly to their sites and ours but here are some initial stats:
Top line: Using State.gov, America.gov, Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and more, we have use new media and connection
technology tools to reach over an estimated 100K audiences domestically and internationally through the video on Food
Security and ultimately have brought press and attention to a new focus. This video is engaging in that it raises
awareness and education on a critical foreign policy issue.
1: It is one of the top 20 videos viewed on our Youtube channel, with over 5K views and rising. Considering how
much video we generate through the daily press briefings and videos through S remarks daily, I think this carries

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764287 Date: 07/31/2015
tremendous weight that in a short amount of time and little push to reach out to communities we have raised
the bar for engaging content through video.
2. Many organizations and users on Youtube have picked up the video and reposted on their channels, for
examples it is has been picked up heavily in China from one user who generated 3K views on his own already
and I have been told that it has been posted on major Ethiopian blogs through their video channels as well.
3. Over 12,000 (estimated) have visited our main video page through State.gov where the video was featured.
4. Almost 9K people have visited the Global Food Security page through State.gov to get more information.
5. Through pushing out on social networking presences at State, we have reached over 65,000 people who
subscribe and follow the Department of State and we pushed this video and the broader FS page to those
communities through Facebook, Twitter, and more.
Next Steps:

New Idea:
Cheryl, wanted to talk to you about a new idea that I have presented before but thought about using for FS in a modified
form. I discussed with Caitlin and wanted to see if you thought this was a good idea.
This proposal is to ask that Secretary Clinton begin an online conversation on Food Security where she can engage with
people at home and abroad.
1. Through a video announcement she announces the opening of a global and engaging talk worldwide talk on
global hunger and invites people to submit questions on the topic. People can submit questions via video, text,
email, comment.
2. The community votes and comments on the best questions submitted by one another and votes on the best
ones.
3. After two weeks, Secretary Clinton answers then the top five questions in her own response video. *** We
could even bring person with best question to DC to be a citizen journalist for a day and ask the top questions in
person.
4. We then use this video as a way to talk about the most frequently asked questions on global hunger, HRC's
responses to them and we have engaged a global community on the topic.

I can attest to the fact that this has thus far been the shining star of the initiative (from a non-policy perspective) and I think
speaks to how hrc will do diplomacy and development differently.
In addition to what katie mentioned-- Institute for International Education (goodman) included it in their weekly email to
more than 8000 institutions, Pepsi showed it an internal meeting last week and will show it at a global conference this
week, and CGI has gotten feedback about the video and has gotten increased interest in commitments in this area. It has
also been pushed out to posts through internal sites.
We are also trying to see if we can get it in a rotation or on mtvU or their website and bet as part of the world food day
push.

Subject: Video Success and Another Idea
Cheryl
Hope this finds you well. I wanted to update you on the success of the video and also share a new idea with you. Give
the statistical results below, I honestly believe this is the State Departments first ever successful instance of policy
advocacy via viral video and the impact we have raised is worth noting. I have heard comments from all over the
building and outside that this is a new level of creating content/video that is engaging, interesting, educating and that
can have long term value for State and partners to use. Bottom-line, we have done something new in raising
awareness/attention on a major foreign policy initiative through compelling, and viral video -- the Department of State
has raised the bar.
It is hard to read the traffic exactly to their sites and ours but here are some initial stats:
Top line: Using State.gov, America.gov, Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and more, we have use new media and connection
technology tools to reach over an estimated 100K audiences domestically and internationally through the video on Food
Security and ultimately have brought press and attention to a new focus. This video is engaging in that it raises
awareness and education on a critical foreign policy issue.
1. It is one of the top 20 videos viewed on our Youtube channel, with over 5K views and rising. Considering how
much video we generate through the daily press briefings and videos through S remarks daily, I think this carries
tremendous weight that in a short amount of time and little push to reach out to communities we have raised
the bar for engaging content through video.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764294 Date: 07/31/2015
2. Many organizations and users on Youtube have picked up the video and reposted on their channels, for
examples it is has been picked up heavily in China from one user who generated 3K views on his own already
and I have been told that it has been posted on major Ethiopian blogs through their video channels as well.
3. Over 12,000 (estimated) have visited our main video page through State.gov where the video was featured.
4. Almost 9K people have visited the Global Food Security page through State.gov to get more information.
5. Through pushing out on social networking presences at State, we have reached over 65,000 people who
subscribe and follow the Department of State and we pushed this video and the broader FS page to those
communities through Facebook, Twitter, and more.
Next Steps:
1. We are making DVD's to give to posts
2. Working on distributing to bloggers for continued use
3. Will feature and push video to a larger audience when op-ed runs through a second push
4. Will work to feature prominently on World Food Day
5. Working to translate and subtitle video for usage in countries around the world.

Madam Secretary,
I know you are deeply concerned about reports of ongoing violence and attacks against women that have occurred in
Guinea-Conakry. I want to let you know what actions the Africa Bureau is taking to address this crisis.
I met with Guinean Foreign Minister Alexandre Cece Loua this morning at 9:00. I expressed our deep outrage at the
brutal actions of Guinean security forces against protesters on September 28, which resulted in 157 deaths, hundreds
more injured, and the widespread rape of women. I will separately provide you with a formal readout of the meeting. I
have also sent one of my Deputies, Bill Fitzgerald, to Conakry, where he met yesterday with President Dadis Camara and
expressed the same outrage.
We are pressing the government to take immediate actions to stop the violence and to restore constitutional order. We
have asked Dadis Camara to step aside and to seek exile in Morocco or another French-speaking country. We have also
asked Guinea to invite in observers from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to monitor the
actions of the military and developments toward a democratic transition. In addition, we have indicated that we will
seek an international investigation in order to arrest and punish the perpetrators of the violence.
We have indicated that if the Government of Guinea does not act rapidly, we will pursue sanctions against government
officials. In all of these actions, we are consulting with the French, whose views and actions closely mirror ours, as well
as with several west African states, including Liberia and Senegal.

Holds, delays on Cabinet picks hurting American businesses
By Nelson W. Cunningham - 10/06/09 03:45 PM ET
You may never have heard of the Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, or the Under Secretary
of Treasury for International Affairs. You may have vaguely assumed there was a Deputy United States Trade
Representative, and an Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs, and an ambassador to
Brazil, but never thought much of them or what they do.
But ask American CEOs and business leaders who they turn to in Washington for help getting a fair shake in
foreign markets or untying global trade knots, and you will learn that these are the very officials they rely on.
Yet today, when every export dollar and trade-supported job is essential to America's economic recovery, these
key positions sit empty. And, surprisingly, these five seats are empty because of stalls and behind-the-scenes
maneuvers by Senate Republicans — usually key allies of U.S. business.
In each case, the names went up months ago. The nominees have strong credentials and many have
demonstrated strong bipartisan support. The reasons for the holds and delays vary. But even if the blocking
actions are unrelated, collectively they deny American businesses their most effective overseas advocates.
•Miriam Sapiro, who was unanimously approved by the Finance Committee in July to be Deputy United States
Trade Representative with responsibility for trade agreements and enforcement with Europe and the Americas
(including NAFTA), has a one-man hold by Sen. Jim Bunning (R-Ky.) over a Canadian tobacco bill.
•Arturo Valenzuela, nominee for Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere, was overwhelmingly
approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in July, but Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) has a one-man hold
on Valenzuela as a protest against the administration's Honduras policy.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764301 Date: 07/31/2015
•Thomas Shannon, nominee for ambassador. to Brazil, is also being blocked by Sen. DeMint over Honduras.
Shannon is hardly political, but is a career foreign service officer who was President Bush's top official for
Latin America at the NSC and then the State Department.
•Francisco Sanchez, nominated in April to be Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade,
responsible for advancing U.S. export and trade opportunities around the world. Republican staff under Sen..
Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) on the Finance Committee have repeatedly delayed a hearing.
•Lael Brainard, nominated in March to be Under Secretary of Treasury for International Affairs, is also being
held up by the Republican staff on the Finance Committee. With an empty chair in this powerful position — it
was previously held by future Treasury Secretaries Timothy Geithner and Lawrence Summers — our ability to
coordinate a response to the financial crisis is hampered at a time when we can't afford it.
Who is hurt by these holds and staff delays? Certainly the president, who is facing the worst economic crisis in
50 years, a stalled trade agenda, and economic and political turmoil in many parts of Latin America, including
the hot-button crisis in Honduras.
But U.S. businesses are also hurt. When American companies find themselves in commercial or trade disputes
abroad, or face unfair competition from foreign companies or discriminatory practices from regulators, they turn
directly to the roster above. With all these chairs empty, U.S. businesses with problems abroad find themselves
facing a classic Goldilocks problem — the Cabinet secretaries above are too big (and too busy); and the
officials below are too small to have an impact at the right levels.
Moreover, the international economic issues of greatest interest to U.S. businesses are precisely the ones that
are being hampered by these vacancies: balanced and coordinated growth out of the Great Recession, promotion
of job-generating U.S. exports, delayed trade agreements with Colombia and Panama, barriers into Brazil's
huge market, trade tensions with Canada (our largest trading partner) and security and border issues with
Mexico (our second-largest), among many others.
And while all U.S. business interests overseas are affected by these vacancies, it is our business and political
interests in the Americas that are being hit most directly, because of the responsibilities and expertise of the five
nominees: Predictably, this lamentable situation is renewing cries from our neighbors that even under a
promising new president, they continue to be neglected. And as importantly, our ability to help shape political
and economic events in our hemisphere to advance U.S. interests is suffering greatly. Who wins when we can't
act? Our foreign competitors; not just foreign companies, but Hugo Chavez and his anti-democratic allies.
All this is not to cast blame on the United States Senate, which has a constitutional duty to provide "advice and
consent" on presidential nominations (though it may cause one to question the tradition that permits a single
senator to put an indefinite hold on a nominee). Nor is it to cast blame solely on Republican members or staff.
Democratic senators and their staffs used these same parliamentary maneuvers under Republican presidents.
But it is to say that those who engage in those tactics now — at a time of global economic crisis and with
growing financial, trade and political frictions in our own hemisphere — should be reminded of the harm done
to important U.S. interests. In the days after 9/11, the Democratically-controlled Senate moved swiftly to
confirm the U.N. ambassador and other stalled security-related posts. Today's circumstances are not the same
by any means, but as we confront the worst economic crisis in over 50 years, these are surely no ordinary times.
The time has come for the Senate to carry out its constitutional duty and to end the delays on these five key
commerce and trade nominations. American business deserves an A Team by its side.
Cunningham is managing partner of McLarty Associates, which advises U.S. and multinational businesses on
their international strategies. He was a Democratic White House and Senate aide.

Dear Cheryl,
I don't know who the Goodspot Production company is, but they certainly hit the "sweet spot" on this one. So
powerful, visually and the narration. I'm sending it all over the place.
The Secretary talked to Jim about the video (they ran into each other at National Airport, go figure).
We're going to send the link to all the House Hunger Caucus members and encourage them to put it on their
web sites.
In the meantime, knowing how much leisure time you have on your hands, and using Matt Damon as the "link"
between the two, check out this video clip from this week's episode of Entourage where Matt Damon talks
about US domestic hunger — hilarious, but tough —
(And, in my typical single-minded way, if you do a Spanish version of your global food security video, you
might want to ask Juanes to do the narration — I'm pretty sure he'd say yes.)

know where things stand.

Iraq
• Jack stressed his continued concern over funding for the transfer of police training responsibilities from Defense to
State, noting that it remains "highly ambiguous." (The estimated cost is an initial $500 million, with an additional $700
million a year in expenses.) Defense is insisting it does not have money to transfer to State for this purpose, and the
idea of a Supplemental is problematic, not the least because the timing would not coincide with the transfer of
responsibilities. Jack is concerned that we will look like we are holding up the transfer.
Chinese Tires
• Jim reported that there had been another meeting on Chinese tire imports yesterday where there was interagency
agreement on the "first best option," but disagreement over other options. The Chinese are in town for negotiations
and there will be another meeting tomorrow after the first round.
Baghdad Management Issues
Eric Boswell noted that the Department would extend
Eric also noted that the roof of the USAID building in Baghdad had collapsed.

insist on a debate and roll call vote for Tom Shannon. DeMint apparently warned, however, that any "substantive
change" in our current policy vis-à-vis Honduras would jeopardize both nominations.
• Codel Levin will be heading to Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq, but will not overlap with Jack Lew's stay in those
places.
Legal Issues
• Harold said that one fallout from the renewed focus on Libya is that some former claimants are coming back
seeking new relief.
Hurricane Jimena
• I noted that Hurricane Jimena is expected to make landfall in Baja early tomorrow morning as a powerful Category
4 or 5 Hurricane. Embassy Mexico City and Consulate General Tijuana have issued warden messages and Consular
Affairs has put out a travel alert advising citizens to avoid the areas likely to be hit. Many hotels in the path of the storm
have been largely evacuated, but there are still many Americans who could be affected. The Ops Center is in close touch
with our missions in Mexico to monitor conditions.
Public Affairs
• PJ anticipates questions about Iran's alleged willingness to restart talks and whether the Secretary will meet with
Zelaya.
Deputies Meeting Highlights
Sri Lanka
• The War Crimes Office said that the report to the Hill on alleged war crimes in Sri Lanka is due by September 21.
They have prepared a 60-page draft which is now circulating for clearance. The report covers the period up to May, but
Jack encouraged the Office to consider including later material if it would be helpful.

Pakistani Internally Displaced Persons
• Eric Schwartz said that the Op-ed in today's post by Morton Abramowitz criticizing the U.S. and Pakistan for
allegedly forcing the return of IDPs into Swat and other areas is simply not true. Eric said he would call Mort to discuss
this.
Export Controls
• Andrew Shapiro noted that the interagency process aimed at "reforming" export controls gets underway today.
The goal is to have something to present to Deputies in six weeks.
Brazilian Oil Development
• David Goldwyn said that Brazil's proposed regulations for developing its vast offshore petroleum reserves were
disappointing. Brazil seems to have opted for a nationalist model that will substantially delay bringing on line the most
promising non-OPEC source of oil in years.
H1N1
• OES reported that the Administration will release its report on H1N1 inthe Southern Hemisphere today. The
analysis of the virus in several developed countries in the region suggests that it has not mutated and that the vaccine
being developed should be effective. It is still not clear, however, whether one or two doses will be required.

Honduras: Make it official -- it's a coup
A formal finding would trigger a suspension of U.S. aid.
By Howard L. Berman
September 3, 2009
Official Washington is waiting for the State Department to determine if this summer's events in Honduras
constitute a coup. Actions may speak louder than words, but in this case, one word alone could affect the course
of democracy in the Western Hemisphere.
U.S. law requires that foreign assistance, with the exception of humanitarian and democracy-related aid, be
suspended for "the government of any country whose duly elected head of government is deposed by military
coup or decree." A formal determination by the State Department would trigger this suspension, whereas
previous uses of the word "coup" by U.S. authorities have not. The matter will be on many minds today as
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton meets with ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya.
The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a "coup d'etat" as "a sudden decisive exercise of force in politics;
especially: the violent overthrow or alteration of an existing government by a small group."
So far, the United States has taken a measured approach to this matter, allowing negotiations between Latin
American leaders and the de facto Honduran government to run their course. But our patience is not without
end, and President Obama, Secretary of State Clinton, the U.N. General Assembly and the Organization of
American States have already put the label to good use.
In late June, amid a constitutional impasse with his country's supreme court and military, Zelaya was taken from
his home by soldiers, bundled aboard a plane in his pajamas and flown out of the country. Since then, even in
the face of united hemispheric and world condemnation of the coup, a de facto government led by the former
head of the Honduran Congress, Roberto Micheletti, has dug in its heels.

This one looks, walks and quacks like a duck. It's time to stop hedging and call this bird what it is. And if, for
whatever reason, the State Department lawyers do not conclude that this was a coup, Congress should examine
other ways by which it can directly affect the flow of aid.
Cutting off assistance is a blunt instrument, one that should not be wielded lightly. It can affect livelihoods and
families and industries, in addition to targeting those at the top. But Honduras will hold presidential and
parliamentary elections Nov. 29, and every passing day gives Micheletti and his associates the chance to tighten
their illegitimate hold on the reins of power.
In negotiations, they have done little more than stall, hoping that the matter of the coup will become moot as
elections near. They refuse to participate in a regional agreement brokered under Costa Rican President Oscar
Arias and the OAS to restore Zelaya so that he can serve the remainder of his term, even with strict conditions
on his exercise of power under international monitoring.
All the while, conditions in Honduras are coming to resemble what we saw in this region in the 1970s,
especially for those who are known to have voted for Zelaya. In August, the Inter-American Commission on
Human Rights, an autonomous and respected regional human rights monitor, found in Honduras today "the
existence of a pattern of disproportionate use of public force, arbitrary detentions and the control of information
aimed at limiting political participation by a sector of the citizenry [and] ... the use of repression against
demonstrations ... the arbitrary enforcement of curfews; the detentions of thousands of people; cruel, inhuman
and degrading treatment; and poor detention conditions."
The de facto government claims that Zelaya was trying to subvert the Honduran Constitution and convert the
country into a satellite of Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez. That may be. But having soldiers take Zelaya
out of the country at gunpoint is an insult to decades of Latin America's hard-won, historic struggle with
democracy.
No matter what we think of Zelaya (and I don't think highly of him) and his actions to change the Honduran
Constitution, it is a fact that his mandate to govern was gained in a fully transparent election.
Democracy and the rule of law are not so fully established in this hemisphere that the coup can be treated in
isolation and as an exception that is allowed to stand. The longer it takes to right this wrong, the less legitimate
the November elections will be, and the climb out of this hole will be all the steeper for the entire region.
We should wield our influence by withdrawing all but the most necessary assistance, an action that would be in
keeping with those of 34 countries in the Western Hemisphere that want to see democracy restored to Honduras.
Howard L. Berman (D-Valley Village) is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

I fully agree that we have to act fast and demonstrate that the Secretary will not accept either failure to follow the
contract or improper conduct
But a blue ribbon panel takes time to assemble, coordinate with other agencies and get a report out
We must move faster

My suggestion is a small fast panel (3 or 4) to go out and look at specifics in kabul and report back to the Secretary
immediately on on steps that can be taken right away
Team would go out monday the 9th look at contractor oversight and propose quick changes (both on the contractors
part and by State)
That way the Secretary will have implemented changes by the end of the month at latest

Subject: Honduras: Quiet Talks
To All:
Arturo Corrales, a de facto supporter with whom we have maintained contact, told our USOAS chief today that
he has been in touch directly with Zelaya regarding a possible deal involving political amnesty, acceptance of
"most" of the San Jose Accord, and mutually agreed upon political reforms. This effort builds upon Corrales
meetings last week with the pro-Zelaya Honduran permrep at the UN. Pressed upon whether this was serious
or simply a de facto effort to buy time and avoid further U.S. pressure, Corrales insisted that there was a real
chance for a deal as early as Thursday.
Caveat: We have encouraged Corrales to keep at it and stay in touch with us, but we have heard about similar
soundings in the past that later went awry, so a healthy dose of skepticism is in order. The Secretary can
sound out Zelaya about this tomorrow as she urges him to get serious about reaching a deal.

There's one detail I left out b/c it's referenced in the POGO letter but not in the information I received -- March
2009 continued "grave concerns" about AGNA. Will check on that in the AM.
Background
DOS competitively awarded Armor Group, North America, Inc. (AGNA) a contract to provide static protection
for Embassy Kabul in March 2007. An Office of Acquisition Management (AQM) Contracting Officer (CO)
and two DS Contracting Officer Representatives (CORs) assigned in Washington have overall contract
oversight responsibility and participate in weekly meetings between the DS program office and AGNA
management. Two Assistant Regional Security Officers are designated as the COR and Assistant COR.
Allegations of misconduct and inappropriate actions by AGNA first raised in June 2007, with multiple notices
of deficiency filed through September 2008. In May 2009, DOS determined that AGNA had adequately
addressed the deficiencies and was contract compliant. DOS exercised the next option year of AGNA's
contract on July 1, 2009.
In May 2009, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Contracting Oversight
(Senators McCaskill and Collins submitted requests for information on the allegations of misconduct in 2007
and 2008. Hearings were held on June 10, 2009.
On September 1, 2009, photos were released of questionable activity at Camp Sullivan, the residence for
AGNA's guards in Kabul, and the Project on Government Oversight (POGO) sent a letter the Secretary
encouraging investigation into the allegations of misconduct in 2008 and 2009.
Current State
Status of investigations:
• As of September 3, the RSO investigative team in Kabul has conducted more than 30 interviews of
personnel who may have firsthand knowledge of the incident(s). Information obtained from the
interviews points to contractual deficiencies, with no indications of criminal activity, waste, fraud or
abuse.
• A team of investigators from the Office of Inspector General (OIG) arrived in Kabul on September 3 to
pursue their investigation into possible criminal violations.
• A senior DS team will arrive next week, including an additional OIG investigator.
Actions to date:

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764408 Date: 07/31/2015
• AGNA relieved from duty the personnel involved in the photographs. They will be terminated as soon
as RSO interviews are completed.
• The entire AGNA management team in Kabul will be removed from the contract as soon as
replacements are identified. The replacement of the management team will be phased so as to not
jeopardize the security of the embassy. In the interim, an A/RSO is assigned full-time to Camp Sullivan
to monitor all contractor activities.
Chronology of Events
May 2004 M The military ceased providing static protection for Embassy Kabul, creating a need for
contracted security services. DOS first contracted with PAE, Louis Berger, as an interim
measure ahead of full and open competition.
July 2005 M Contract awarded to MVM. MVM began the transition, but was unable to begin
contract performance and was terminated. The PAE Louise Berger contract remained in
place during this time.
April 2006 M DOS issued a new contract solicitation.
2007
March 12 M DOS competitively awarded Armor Group, North America, Inc. (AGNA). An Office of
Acquisition Management (AQM) Contracting Officer (CO) and two DS Contracting
Officer Representatives (CORs) assigned in Washington have overall contract oversight
June M DOS received information that indicated misconduct and inappropriate actions by
AGNA to include failure to staff positions, provide uniforms, vehicles and other
contractor provided equipment.
June 26 M Meeting held with AGNA to convey the Department's concern and request that issued be
addressed immediately. Responses received from AGNA on June 27 and July 16.
July 19 M DOS CO issued a Cure Notice to address several contractor weaknesses and
deficiencies, including a failure to provide sufficient staffing and equipment. Over the
course of the contract, other deficiencies were identified and addressed with the
contractor, including failure to maintain a current ITAR license, failure to provide
sufficient language-qualified guards, and continued staffing and equipment shortages.
2008
April 30 M DOS CO issued a final deficiency letter to AGNA, putting the contractor on notice for
recurring and new deficiencies identified by the COR. AGNA was informed that the
DOS was evaluating whether or not to exercise the option to extend the contract in 2009,
dependent upon the contractor's ability to fully demonstrate that it could permanently
resolve the deficiencies. The letter requested a final corrective action plan that entailed a
measurable, attainable milestone schedule to enable DOS to monitor progress weekly.
Sept 21 M DOS CO issued a Show Cause notice to AGNA, necessitated by repeated staffing
shortages. Show Cause notice was evaluated by DS, Legal and AQM, with final
determination that all pending deficiencies were correctable and progress was being made
by the contractor. Progress toward addressing the identified deficiencies was closely
monitored by the CO, DS and RSO-Kabul.

President Arias just called to ask about the Zelaya meeting. I gave him a readout and took him through the
statement, including word for word the part on elections.
Arias was very pleased. He even used the phrase "beginning of the end of the de facto regime." He liked our
idea of diplomatic outreach and I assured him that San Jose would be a top destination for us. He also
strongly endorsed our plan to go to Brussels, Madrid and the Vatican. He himself has spoken frequently with
the Spanish to get them to press for EU action similar to ours.
Finally, Arias was very pleased that Hugo plans to call in the candidates to get them to go to Micheletti and say
that an election outside the San Jose process is of dubious legitimacy.
I told Arias that the Secretary is very strong in her commitment to the San Jose process and Arias asked that I
give her his warm regards.

found in his home at approximately 0500 EDT. The RSO is on the scene and Monrovia's consular section is
aware of the situation and will work to repatriate the body. UNMIL is working to determine who from the UN
will call Fosnight's next-of-kin. Post had no further details, but will continue to provide them to Ops. The
Liberian Minister of Justice has asked UNMIL representatives and Charge Robinson to attend a meeting at
0730 EDT to discuss press responses. The Watch connected the PA/Press duty officer to Embassy Monrovia.
ACTION REQUEST: Embassy Monrovia has requested press guidance from the Department as soon as
possible, preferably before the 0730 EDT meeting. The Embassy prefers NOT to issue a joint statement with
Liberian or UNMIL representatives. The Embassy is closed today, but the Charge will be available by
telephone.
Ops has informed the CA/OCS, AF, and PA/Press duty officers by telephone, and stands by ready to assist.
Regards,
Stephanie L. Hallett

One correction: Fosnight's passport was not / not seized. Fosnight says he can't find it (which is interesting,
since he says he planned to fly to Sierra Leone this afternoon).
And one update: So far, all the Liberian lawyers contacted have refused to take the case.

Subject: Update: Amcit at UN Mission in Liberia - alleged illegal activity
Here is today's update. Sunday has been eventful.
- Fosnight was arrested about 40 minutes ago and is under house arrest. His U.S. passport has been seized. The
Consular Officer is aware and has passed to him (via the RSO, who's on the scene) the names of three local
lawyers. The RSO reported that Fosnight is also seeking to be in touch with a U.S. lawyer. The Consular
Officer will send a report of arrest cable tomorrow, and stands ready to meet with Fosnight.
- The GOL has formally asked UNMIL to assist in making sure that the house arrest is effective, in order to
ensure that Fosnight's rights are protected and to minimize flight risk.
- Getting to this point involved a harrowing six hours. This morning at approximately 11:00 am, the Liberia
National Police, accompanied by UN Police and our RSO, went to Fosnight's apartment to carry out the
arrest. Although Fosnight had been under LNP surveillance by five officers, he managed to leave the apartment
at around 10:00 in his UN-marked vehicle. (The Director of Police will be investigating how that
happened.) Airport, immigration, police, and UN authorities were alerted.
- At approximately 3:00 pm, we learned that Fosnight was still in Monrovia and was in phone contact with
UNMIL officials as well as LNP officers. Finally, he agreed to be met by the LNP at his apartment, where he
was arrested. He was read his rights, and read the charges, which include statutory rape and exploitation of
children, among other charges. Fosnight stated that he and his Sierra Leonean ex-wife (or ex-girlfriend) - the

woman with whom he adopted the five-year old - were planning to fly out this afternoon on Elysian Air to
Freetown.
- At the apartment this morning, the arrest team discovered that Fosnight had left behind in the apartment his
five-year old daughter and housekeeper, a young Liberian man of about 20 years. The housekeeper had
recently burned a large box of papers and other items outside behind the apartment. There was no computer in
the apartment, but there was a router, which was still plugged in. The five-year old has been put into protective
custody and the housekeeper is being questioned.
- Also in LNP custody for questioning are the Liberian ex-girlfriend and the Sierra Leonean ex-wife. The Sierra
Leonean had been in the apartment in the morning and left around 10:00 am, separately from Fosnight.
- A team of ICE officers is trying to arrive Tuesday; details TBC.

Mullen did better than Eikenberry -- Holbrooke's we know it when you see it test is not helping. Need to tell a more
compelling story of what we hope to accomplish in terms of civilian effort a.k.a. nation building. The standard needs to
be more modest than open ended and sustainable in a context where US military presence is not a long term
requirement if afghan army and police can be built up.
We have not thought about having any press on my trip, should we? Goal would be to show getting civilians in the right
place at the right time and reliance on leveraging small number of us civilians to deploy large number of afghans. On the

I was delighted to see the Rothkopf piece yesterday, and not only b/c he mentioned me! It identified State as the source
of big ideas under your leadership, ideas that adapt our foreign policy to a 21st c world and allow us to get things done.
As I think about what I want to sink my teeth into over the next 18 months and how I can best serve you, I have
concluded that I want to devote myself full time to the QDDR. -- driving the process and the outcomes as efficiently and
effectvely as possible. I have run something like this before; I know almost all the players; my staff is well plugged into
the building; and I am committed to all the ideas that we want to see emerge. Instead of hiring a senior director, I
propose that the AID designate and I start driving the process by working w/ Karen and the staff and reporting
to/engaging the senior leadiership team on a weekly basis.
As Cheryl and I discussed, I am well aware that taking on this role means cutting many other things that I do. The
demands for policy planning talks have been proliferating because they serve the interests of the bureaus. I am less
convinced that they are the best use of my time or that they allow me to best serve you. There are 2 sets -- one with 5
middle eastern countries that we have agreed to hold in Jordan this fall -- this is their second meeting -- and the second
round of the russia-eu-us talks that I think it would be very detrimental to cancel. But I shd b able to make those each 3
day trips total. Other than that I wd cancel all my planned travel for the fall. I would also limit outside speaking
engagements except to the extent such engagement served QDDR outreach purposes. QDDR meetings will also take
priority on my calendar, alongside meetings w/ my staff on other projects we are pursuing.
As it is shaping up, the QDDR combines thinking and doing in a way that fits what I think I can bring to the table perfectly
and make this what you want it to be. I very much want to take on the role I describe, and hope you agree.

Sent: Fri Sep 04 18:07:27 2009
Subject: Possible Rieser Call on Foreign Ops Bill
Cheryl:
We have just learned that Tim Rieser may call you soon to request that the Secretary call Senator Reid to urge
him take up the FY10 State/Foreign Ops Appropriations Bill at the earliest opportunity in September —to avoid
the negative impact of a continuing resolution on State operations and programs.
As you know, if Senator Reid was able/willing to schedule time on the Senate floor there still remains a
significant obstacle. While the FY10 Bill had broad bipartisan support prior to markup, it now includes a
controversial Lautenberg amendment that would reverse the Mexico City policy statutorily. With
Lautenberg's amendment in the Bill, procedural hurdles are almost certain to lengthen and slow down floor
action.
It is possible that an agreement could be reached to bring up the Bill and structure votes so that the
Republicans could offer amendments including one to strike Lautenberg's language.
Should you agree to ask the Secretary to make such a call I would imagine she would want to get views from
Jack Lew, Pat Kennedy, Rich Greene, and Rich Verma, first.
Here are some points to consider for such a possible call:
• Timely enactment of the FY 10 State/Foreign Ops appropriation is critical to national security.
• Operating under a Continuing Resolution for any extended period of time will negatively impact
both State operations and foreign assistance programs.
• For example, the funds available to support State operations in Iraq are estimated to last only
through the first quarter of FY 2010. In addition our urgent hiring plans will be stifled, pay equity
authorities will lapse, and we will be without the necessary resources to implement our agenda on food
security, climate change, and global health.
• I urge you to take up the FY 10 State/Foreign Ops bill as early as possible in September.

Mexico City Policy: The inclusion during markup of the Lautenberg amendment in the Senate bill codifies a
ban on future adoption of the Mexico City Policy. This controversial issue will slow down consideration of
the Bill, as the Minority will use parliamentary maneuvers to block timely debate and final passage.

More News From Guards on the Ground in Kabul
A quick update from the ground in Kabul: we've heard that guards at the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan are very
pleased with the State Department's actions so far, with one source saying guards feel as if they've been
"liberated from prison." State Department investigators have been conducting thorough, respectful interviews
and are not asking guards if they shared information with POGO. The right people are being fired and it looks
like we're on the way to restoring an atmosphere of professionalism at the U.S. Embassy.
The contractor who was forced out of his position, by the way, was asked to leave before the State Department
arrived on the scene. More as it comes in.

Subject: RE: New POGO story - forced resignation of whistleblower
We are now in a battle with POGO for ownership of this issue. What the Embassy today did was quite effective -
maintaining the initiative and outlining decisive actions taken. We need to continue this trend, forcing POGO to react to
what we are doing rather than the other way around. The Embassy statement does include removal of supervisors. I
wonder from a contracting and legal standpoint how to react if asked to POGO's suggestion that supervisors are not
allowed to work for another contractor. While people have a right to work, I believe we get to review a contractor's
management team and instruct them on who is acceptable or not, right? I don't necessarily buy into POGO's Nuremberg
defense, that people are exonerated because they were forced to debase themselves. But I see the release below as
good news, that we have established momentum on the issue. We should retain it even though it will become more
challenging as Congress returns next week.

One of the whistleblowers who helped expose the guard scandal at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul has just been forced to
resign after his company—whose client is ArmorGroup, North America (AGNA)—came to believe that he had reached
out to D.C. for assistance. The company told POGO that the whistleblower's resignation was voluntary.
However, information obtained by the Project On Government Oversight (POGO) strongly suggests he was pressured

Subject: Schedule and staffing
Dear Cheryl,
Thank you for the call on Thursday and for your understanding about my need to take care of certain
responsibilities before I depart as SCSL Prosecutor.
The Taylor testimony is going well from our point of view. He is opening himself to a devastating CX by
telling unexpected and unnecessary lies about his activities in Liberia and the region. I have been using my
access to senior Liberian, Sierra Leone, and UN officials to obtain new evidence with which to confront
him. This is well in hand and I dont see a problem in leaving even if Taylor is still on the stand on September
7. The major reason to stay as Prosecutor until that date (aside from the requirement of a 30-day notice to the
UNSG) is the oral argument on the appeal of our last case in Freetown (involving historic gender violence
convictions) on September 2, 3, and 4.
However, from my conversations with Clint, I am concerned that there are several issues that are coming to
head at this time, and know that I will have to hit the ground very fast on September 8. Because my schedule is
light in the coming week and because I have some leave days to use, I have therefore planned a quick trip to DC
to be there from Wednesday noon through Saturday noon, August 26-29. I wont yet move into the office, but
the staff will help me schedule some informal meetings on several issues. Additionally, this will give me a
chance to look for a place to live.
. I hope that we can talk when I am Washington this week.

Cheryl,
We spoke with 10, EEB, and Amb. Cousin after the meeting today and came up with the following revision to S's call
points. We decided the best language would be for the Secretary to say that if UNSYG cannot co-host, that she would
welcome the participation of his representative. The important point here is that we do not want the FAO head -
Jacques Diouf —to end-up co-hosting the UNGA event, and everyone agreed there was a danger Ban ki-Moon would
suggest he do so. In the background at the bottom I included a point stressing that we do not want Diouf to co-host.
Thanks,
Marisa

Hillary:
Below and attached is a note on CTBT Conference. After reviewing, see if you think it makes sense for you to
attend. We do and have vetted the idea with others. Of note is that this would be on 24 Sept after the President
has chaired the Non-Proliferation Security Council Meeting so it will be amplifying his remarks. We also will
have to think through, if you do this, what the Hill angle is but we think there is a good case to be made for it so
we will want to discuss with you this week.

Hi guys,
Can you provide, by COB today, an informal note that lays out in brief:
1. The purpose of this conference
2. Who you expect to participate (which countries and at what level)
3. What message S would deliver in her remarks; and
4. Any other info you think would be helpful in making a decision
I like this idea a lot, provided that there is broad FM participation and we have a useful message to deliver.

Cheryl, regard the desire of the Economic Club of DC to invite HRC to speak (which we
consulted on a week ago), they're now broadening the invite to be any time in the fall—which
I'd think might increase the chances of it suited her purposes. I'm attaching a copy of the letter
they'll send in via any channel you designate (scheduler, public affairs officer, or whatever).
HRC did call this weekend and we covered a pretty wide range of substantive issues. I
decided, however, not to bother her with this matter, which I hope was the right call on my part.
Also, Jake put in a call to me last week. We didn't connect. I don't know if that's OBE as a
result of HRC's call. In any event, I'm around this week, though hanging out as much as
ossible with

Cheryl, I hope for your sake that you don't get this email for a while and that you're getting
some genuine R&R. Anyway, David Rubenstein of the Carlyle Group is asking my advice on
whether HRC would welcome an invitation to address the Economic Club of Washington in
September. Obviously business-heavy. Audience: 400-500, screen questions for after talk and
he can provide them in advance; media coverage, etc. I told him I had no idea but would
check. Depending on her outreach strategy for the fall, it could be a good audience, esp. if she
wanted to talk about issues like China, the development, the role of the private sector, or
energy/climate—i.e., the econ aspect/component of foreign policy. If I should be going
elsewhere for this kind of steer, lemme know. Regards, Strobe

Subject: if S asks about Libya
I talked to the Libyan Foreign Minister, Musa Kusa, today. He clearly "gets it." He said that Megrahi would
NOT appear on the September 1 revolution day festivities (40th anniversary of the "green revolution"). And
he said that he totally understood that Qadhafi should stay in New York and not set up a tent in New
Jersey. At the same time, others from the MFA called in our Embassy in Tripoli and called in the UK
ambassador. The Libyans are clearly looking for a way out of the self-inflicted mess. Let's hope that these
wiser heads can prevail on Qadhafi.
We've double-tracked with the (very good and long-suffering) Libyan Ambassador here.

STATEMENT BY IAN KELLY, SPOKESMAN
Temporary Suspension of Non-Immigrant Visa Services in Honduras
The OAS Foreign Ministers mission is in Honduras seeking support for the San Jose Accord, which would restore the
democratic and constitutional order and resolve the political crisis in Honduras. In support of this mission and as a
consequence of the de facto regime's reluctance to sign the San Jose Accord, the U.S. Department of State is conducting a
full review of our visa policy in Honduras. As part of that review, we are suspending non-emergency, non-immigrant visa
services in the consular section of our embassy in Honduras, effective August 26. We firmly believe a negotiated solution
is the appropriate way forward and the San Jose Accord is the best solution.

Beihl called me from the plane just before departure. De facto negotiating team will return to DC Wednesday for
several days talks. While ministers were discouraged by de factor regime intransigence, Beihl said that Zelaya had also
lost some support. He said that all the ministers were shocked by Zelaya's behavior in a telephone conference call just
before their press conference this afternoon. Zelaya spoke of people dying by hundreds, being thrown in jail and
tortured. Zelaya appeared to be very out-of-touch, Beihl said. He added that "even" the Argentine FM was questioning
whether Z's return was the correct course. Beihl said that while a democratic solution was needed, perhaps Zelaya was
not the right option. I again expressed our position that the problem was not who replaced Zelaya, but that he was
removed unconstitutionally.
News conference was straightforward. Only one minister spoke (I don't know them by face), said that the solution was
return to democratic order and the regime not prepared to accept Si. I haven't got hold of transcript yet, will do so
asap.
Beihl again expressed thanks for our move on visas (as well as our logistical support), saying that all the ministers
thought it a good move.

Subject: Israel PM: progress made with U.S. on settlements (AP)
LONDON (AP) Israel and the U.S. are making headway in defusing an unusually public disagreement over West Bank
settlements, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said as he met a top American envoy in London on
Wednesday. Netanyahu has said ahead of his meeting with U.S. Mideast envoy George Mitchell that he wants an
agreement that allows Israel to proceed with some settlement construction while at the same time restarting peace
talks with the Palestinians. In the past week, both Israel and the U.S. have been signaling that an agreement could be
within reach. Speaking alongside Mitchell before the meeting, Netanyahu said he hoped peace negotiations would
resume "shortly." "We are making headway. My government has taken steps in both words and deeds to move
forward," he said. But in the days preceding Wednesday's meeting, the key encounter of the Israeli leader's four-day
London trip, he also made clear he sees the spotlight on settlements as unfair and insisted the Mideast conflict is rooted
in a deep Arab enmity toward Israel that predates them.

Cheryl,
As discussed, please see the attached draft cable for the Secretary's approval. The draft letter text is pasted
below. WHA would like the Secretary to send a letter to all the UNASUR (Union of South American Nations)
foreign ministers regarding support for the U.S.-Colombia Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA). UNASUR is
having its summit meeting on August 28 and WHA would like the letter sent as soon as possible so that it can
be read and processed before the summit. Please note that Steinberg himself has NOT signed off on this
letter (his staff has), but we are expecting to hear from him this morning. Please tell me if you think this
should be held till he weighs in.

Sensitive But Unclassified
UNASUR Letter on Colombia
• Cheryl and Jim said they both thought that there were things missing from the latest WHA draft of a letter from
the Secretary to UNASUR members. The goal is to get the final version to the Secretary as soon as possible.
Mitchell meeting with Netanvahu
• Cheryl noted that the Secretary will receive a readout from Senator Mitchell on his meeting with Prime Minister
Netanyahu shortly.
Libya
• Bill reported that Jeff Feltman has not heard back definitively on Qaddafi's decision about staying in New Jersey
during UNGA. Pat Kennedy said he had talked to USUN about possibly allowing Qaddafi to pitch his tent in Fort
Hamilton in Brooklyn. Mike Polt noted that he had spoken to Congressman Rothman twice yesterday, and that
Rothman expressed hope we would have a definitive answer from the Libyans by Sunday, when the Rabbi in
Englewood, N.J. plans a protest at the Libyan Residence.
H1N1
• Pat said he had received a call from John Brennan thanking State for providing data on H1N1 outbreaks in the
Southern Hemisphere and asking relevant desks to let their embassies know that the USG would be issuing a
report on this.
Honduras
• Harold said he had signed off on an action memo to the Secretary along with WHA and F regarding restrictions
on assistance to Honduras. (I subsequently confirmed that the package has not yet come forward to the Line -
it is awaiting WHA front office clearance and Jim Steinberg's final approval.)
• Derek Chollet said that S/P has drafted the options memo for the Secretary on the upcoming Presidential
election in Honduras.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764547 Date: 07/31/2015
• Ian said he anticipated questions on Qaddafi and UNGA, Senator Mitchell's meeting with PM Netanyahu, and
the results of the delegation to Honduras. He noted in this regard that the decision to suspend NIV issuances in
Honduras attracted relatively little attention, but any decision with respect to a possible cut off in assistance
would attract a great deal more.
• Ian noted that CNN is running with a story based apparently on a State IG report faulting the Department for
being slow in planning for the safety and effectiveness of U.S. civilians in Iraq in the wake of the U.S. military
withdrawal. Pat said he thought this was based on an old IG report. Jim said that our line should be that we are
confronting the implications of the military withdrawal, that we have an elaborate planning process in place,
and that we are focused heavily on the safety and security of remaining USG employees.
• RI noted that the Secretary will issue a statement on Senator Kennedy's death, and that Senator Mitchell also
would put out a message in his capacity as a former Senate colleague.
• Finally, PJ reported that ABC has not yet given up on the story related to a Soviet-style effort by the Russians to
entrap/smear a Department employee in Moscow. (The incident in question stems from the time the employee
did not work for the Department, but was studying Russian language in Vladivostok.) We are trying to convince
ABC that this is not a story and if there is a story, it is that the Russians continue to use old techniques to try to
entrap our employees.

Subject: Possible Rieser Call on Foreign Ops Bill
Cheryl:
We have just learned that Tim Rieser may call you soon to request that the Secretary call Senator Reid to urge him take
up the FY10 State/Foreign Ops Appropriations Bill at the earliest opportunity in September— to avoid the negative
impact of a continuing resolution on State operations and programs.
As you know, if Senator Reid was able/willing to schedule time on the Senate floor there still remains a significant
obstacle. While the FY10 Bill had broad bipartisan support prior to markup, it now includes a controversial Lautenberg
amendment that would reverse the Mexico City policy statutorily. With Lautenberg's amendment in the Bill, procedural
hurdles are almost certain to lengthen and slow down floor action.
It is possible that an agreement could be reached to bring up the Bill and structure votes so that the Republicans could
offer amendments including one to strike Lautenberg's language.
Should you agree to ask the Secretary to make such a call I would imagine she would want to get views from Jack Lew,
Pat Kennedy, Rich Greene, and Rich Verma, first.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764598 Date: 07/31/2015
Here are some points to consider for such a possible call:
Timely enactment of the FY 10 State/Foreign Ops appropriation is critical to national security.
Operating under a Continuing Resolution for any extended period of time will negatively impact both State
operations and foreign assistance programs.
• For example, the funds available to support State operations in Iraq are estimated to last only through the first
quarter of FY 2010. In addition our urgent hiring plans will be stifled, pay equity authorities will lapse, and we will be
without the necessary resources to implement our agenda on food security, climate change, and global health.
I urge you to take up the FY 10 State/Foreign Ops bill as early as possible in September.
Background
Mexico City Policy: The inclusion during markup of the Lautenberg amendment in the Senate bill codifies a ban on future
adoption of the Mexico City Policy. This controversial issue will slow down consideration of the Bill, as the Minority will
use parliamentary maneuvers to block timely debate and final passage.

Subject: Re: Age discrim suit
This is what we know: Bloomberg News contacted the Department's press office on Friday afternoon about an age discrimination suit
that was supposedly filed on Friday in the federal district court for DC. We do not yet have a copy of the complaint and we do not
know as yet whether the US Attorney's Office has in fact been served (an AUSA contact of ours did confirm that a complaint was filed
with the clerk of the court).
The details are also sketchy, but the complaint was apparently filed by an FSO. According to the inquiry that came
in from the press office, apparently alleges that she was the top pick for a position at our Embassy in Algiers, but that she was
denied the position by HR because of her age. This complaint was filed directly in district court; neither S/OCR nor our office have
any record of an administrative complaint being filed.
Our usual practice is not to comment publicly about matters in litigation. If a complaint has in fact been filed, we should have it
sometime tomorrow, and can send you an info memo with more details. But this is all we know right now.

• Mike Polt noted that Bill Burns and Dennis Ross had held a series of meetings on the Hill last week on Iran
sanctions. Bill will also follow up with a call to Senator Dodd. That said, there are three different "streams" of
possible Iran sanctions that we will likely face in October.
• H is still hoping the Secretary will be able to call Senator Leahy to flag the issue of funding for Pakistan FMF and
Mexico.
• Jack noted he had spoken to Congressman Obey about funding for Palau. Obey said he is sympathetic and
apparently Palau will be made whole in the end, but he noted he could not pass a Continuing Resolution if the
Republicans believe we are paying Palau to accept detainees.
• Jim said he will call Senator DeMint regarding his holds on Valenzuela and Shannon.
Assistant Secretaries Meeting
UNESCO
• The fourth round of voting for a new UNESCO head takes place today and the fifth and final tomorrow. Only
two candidates remain — Hosni and Bokova of Bulgaria. The Europeans are supporting Bokova and 10 believes at
least three Latin American votes are still up for grabs and they intend to work with WHA to reach out to those
countries. (10 assured me afterwards that everything will be coordinated with NEA.)
H1N1
• Maria Otero noted that the President had announced that 10 percent of our vaccine will be shared with the rest
of the world.
Cuba
• WHA noted that the just concluded first round of postal talks with Cuba had gone well. They also noted we
would be denying a visa to Alarcon, the head of the National Assembly, to attend UNGA. (I asked WHA to send a
note to S on this, since it will attract attention.)

Feingold reportedly expressed some reservations about the nomination but said he was keeping an open mind. Frankly,
that's not a great sign, since he's been overwhelmingly positive in his meetings with just about all our other candidates.
I can report that H has done just about everything we can do. We've done countless meetings and briefings and had
several mock hearing sessions. That's in addition to all the work on QFRs, counsel questions, testimony, and his SFRC
questionairre. But despite all this work, I still have some very serious concerns heading into tomorrow's confirmation

Libyan Reps tell Rothman Quaddafi not coming to Englewood
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Friday, August 28, 2009 4:04 pm EST
Contact: Bob Decheine (202) 550-7869
Washington, D.C. based representatives of the Libyan government have informed
Congressman Steve Rothman (D-NJ) that Col. Moammar Quaddafi, will not be staying
in Englewood, New Jersey if he comes to the United States for the meeting of the
United Nations General Assembly next month. This information has not yet been
confirmed by the White House or the State Department.
"I am very pleased that Moammar Quaddafi will apparently not be coming to
Englewood. His appearance would have presented unnecessary safety and security
issues for the residents of Englewood and the Libyan diplomats," said Rothman. I
want to thank President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and
the literally dozens of their appointees I have had the pleasure to work so
closely with over the past seven days in achieving this result. I also want to
thank the Libyan government for their hard work and consideration in resolving
this matter in such a positive fashion."

Colleagues
On the assumption that the Department is ready to take the position that we will not permit him to use the NJ
property, recommend the following after consultations with the lawyers and experts who handle our
"hostship" responsibilities
The Department of State has consulted with the Government of Libya regarding the
impending visit of Libyan President Muammar Qadhafi to
attend the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York.
In keeping with prior arrangements, the Englewood, New Jersey property is not available for any use in
connection with the upcoming visit
I don't think that we want/need to get into particulars about boroughs within NYC

Team — we really need something to go out today regarding Qadahfi's visit to the UNGA. There is a rally in NJ
planned for Sunday morning — that rally is growing in scope and impact as the time passes. The Congressional
interest and concern is also growing stronger. I would propose a statement from PJ, along the lines of the one
below, but am open to other ideas. Issuing something next week will not help us all that much.

Obama set to unveil plan on global food security
Christopher Doering, Reuters
Date: 9/22/09
(c) 2009 Reuters
The Obama administration will unveil its long-awaited global food security plan during the next few days with the
United States expected to focus on helping farmers in poor countries feed themselves through better productivity,
research and infrastructure.
Leaders of the G8 countries pledged $20 billion in July to impoverished farmers to tackle chronic hunger. Instead of
counting on food donations,

they want to focus on helping small farmers feed themselves and neighbors through research such as creating seeds
better suited to local conditions, boosting production and infrastructure to get crops to market.
The issue will take center stage when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon discuss
food security on
Saturday in
New York.
A U.S. official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified, confirmed the Obama administration plans to unveil a
food security plan
at or
around the time of the Saturday food security event.
Sen. Richard Lugar, an Indiana Republican, told reporters at a hunger conference that according to notes from Secretary
Clinton, she will discuss "a multi-sectoral approach" promoting the development of infrastructure, education and
research along with increasing farming productivity for
local
producers.
The Obama administration is "on the right track," said Lugar, who has introduced a bill with similar food aid reform
measures. However, he was
not
optimistic that his plan, awaiting vote in the full Senate, would move forward this year.
"Until voters and politicians are motivated, very little can often be accomplished," he said.
More than 1 billion people will be chronically hungry this year, the United Nations' World Food Program estimates, up
from 963 million in

2008 when
food prices spiked, causing hoarding and riots over food in some nations.
Much of the blame on the failure to combat global hunger is because
U.S. politicians, business leaders and others have not made it a
priority, said
Dan Glickman, former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture who is vice chairman
of the Friends of the World Food Program.
Representative Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, said reaction to
the Obama administration's plan will be crucial to determine if the
United
States is committed to trying something new.
"What we don't have is political will," said McGovern. "Leadership is
going to have to come from the White House."

Somalia faces worst food crisis in 18 years: UN
(AFP) – 1 day ago
ROME — Drought, conflict and displacement are causing the worst humanitarian crisis in war-torn Somalia in
18 years, the UN food agency warned on Monday.
Some 3.6 million people, about half the Somali population, need emergency aid including 1.3 million people
displaced by fighting in the Horn of Africa country, the Food and Agriculture Organisation said in a statement.
Around 1.4 million Somali farmers face a severe drought, while some 655,000 poor urban dwellers face high
prices for basic food staples, the FAO said.
Hundreds of thousands of Somalis have fled their homes over the past three years of violence involving hardline
Islamist movements and many more in total over the country's 18 years of almost uninterrupted civil chaos.
Hunger also stalks other countries in east Africa and the Horn of Africa region, the UN agency said.
The number of people depending on food aid in the region -- currently nearly 20 million -- "may increase as the
hunger season progresses, particularly among marginal fanners and low-income urban dwellers," the FAO said.
"Below-average rains combined with conflict and displacement are aggravating an already serious food
insecurity situation in the region," it said.
An added element is El Nino, a weather phenomenon associated with floods, droughts and other climatic
disturbances, the FAO said.
"The effects of El Nino, which usually brings heavy rains towards the end of the year, could make matters
worse, ... destroying crops both in the field and in stores (and) increasing livestock losses," the statement added.
Continued low purchasing power is also threatening food security in the region, the UN agency said.

Dear Secretary Clinton,
It is with great pride and a full heart that I write to thank you for your personal, videotaped message congratulating Gays
and Lesbians in Foreign Affairs Agencies (GLIFAA) on winning this year's "Outie" award for best LGBT employee resource
group by Out & Equal Workplace Advocates . Your message and the significance carried in delivering it personally was
reflected in the silence that came over the audience of over 2,000 people when you began speaking and the furious
applause heard afterwards. While not the only GLIFAA member in attendance that night to receive the award, as the
only Foreign Service Officer there to witness the event, the award held special significance for me. Your message had
the greatest impact on everyone attending the Out & Equal Summit this year, but as a direct beneficiary of your work I
was especially touched and awed.
It is you, Under Secretary Kennedy, and all the senior staff of the Department that truly deserve this honor. As an FSO
with a domestic partner, your efforts to bring equality to State have allowed me to stay in a career I love. Thank you for
all you are doing for the LGBT community, for the Foreign and Civil Service, and for the opportunity to attend such a
conference. I am once again proud to represent the Foreign Service, the Department of State, and the Bureau of
Intelligence and Research.
With tremendous gratitude and warm regards,

Dear All,
After this morning's meeting, L undertook more research
Millennium Challenge Report
The Millennium Challenge Act of 2003 requires the submission of a report to Congress and publication in the Federal
Register of a list of countries that are candidate countries for MCC assistance, and countries that would be candidate
countries but for "specified legal prohibitions on assistance." Honduras is a candidate country. If Honduras is subject to
the restrictions in section 7008, it would be listed in that section of the report that identifies countries that would be
candidate countries but for legal prohibitions that prohibit assistance. The report would also provide an explanation of
the legal prohibition (in fact, other coup restricted countries, such as Cote d'Ivoire, Madagascar, Mauritania, and Sudan,
are on the prohibited list and section 7008 is explicitly mentioned).
The list must be approved by the Board of the MCC, of which the Secretary is the chair, and is due on 9/10. It is our
understanding that an action memo will be presented to the Secretary, perhaps as early as next week, so that she can
approve submission of the report. The action memo will require the Secretary to decide whether Honduras is a country
without a "specified legal prohibition" or whether such a prohibition has in fact attached.

Cheryl - please tell the Secretary that Alec and his delegation in Mexico have done an incredible job. Carlos Slim just
agreed to open his cell phone network to free text messages for people reporting acts of violence, crime and corruption.
We now will work out how to use this information for police tips and public transparency. This is huge, and we are just
at the cusp of understanding the potential power of this tool. Carlos

S message just played as part of opening ceremony. It was very well received. WFP's Amb Ken Quinn discussed the
Secretary's powerful statement in June when the winner of this year's prize was announced. Quinn went on to say that
"I have been working on these issues for over 32 years, and I think that the Secretary understands these issues and is
more committed to fighting hunger than any of her predecessors". Meeting off to a good start.

Keynote lunch speaker was Indra Nooyi, the chair and ceo of Pepsi Co. She noted that this event is growing in both size
and importance every year. Attendence at the lunch alone was over 950 people including Secretary Vilsack and
ministers from many countries. She specifically complemented Secretary Clinton's role in the Sept 26 UN event. Nooyi
used much of her address challenging the private sector to do their part in carrying out the strategy unveiled in New
York.
Secretary Vilsack gave a very powerful address that focused on our efforts feed hungry children and the need to do
more. He refered to working with Secretary Clinton or to "under Secretary Clinton's leadership" at least 3 times. It was
very well done.

Welcome thoughts. I expect to hear further from French today what specifically they have in mind. She could
still go to Paris, but perhaps better not to let them do the Afpak meeting.

Millennium Challenge Report
The Millennium Challenge Act of 2003 requires the submission of a report to Congress and publication in the Federal
Register of a list of countries that are candidate countries for MCC assistance, and countries that would be candidate
countries but for "specified legal prohibitions on assistance." Honduras is a candidate country. If Honduras is subject to
the restrictions in section 7008, it would be listed in that section of the report that identifies countries that would be
candidate countries but for legal prohibitions that prohibit assistance. The report would also provide an explanation of
the legal prohibition (in fact, other coup restricted countries, such as Cote d'Ivoire, Madagascar, Mauritania, and Sudan,
are on the prohibited list and section 7008 is explicitly mentioned).
The list must be approved by the Board of the MCC, of which the Secretary is the chair, and is due on 9/10. It is our
understanding that an action memo will be presented to the Secretary, perhaps as early as next week, so that she can
approve submission of the report. The action memo will require the Secretary to decide whether Honduras is a country
without a "specified legal prohibition" or whether such a prohibition has in fact attached.

Congressional Record

Volume 155, Issue 149
111th Congress - First Session
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my longstanding commitment to assist the Haitian people in
their pursuit of a stable, prosperous and democratic future.
During my trip to Haiti, I was reminded of the tremendous challenges facing this island nation. The U.N.'s appointment
of President Clinton as special envoy to Haiti has helped to keep a much-needed spotlight on Haiti. President Clinton's
appointment of Dr. Paul Farmer as the Deputy U.N. Special Envoy for Haiti, adds an invaluable wealth of experience and
knowledge to the U.N.'s work in Haiti.
As a founder of Partners in Health and the Institute for Justice & Democracy in Haiti, Dr. Farmer has demonstrated a
selfless commitment to the advancement of health and democracy in Haiti for the past 20 years. I have witnessed
firsthand Dr. Farmer's dedication to helping improve the lives of those in need.
He has strong south Florida ties. I am proud to call him a friend, along with our mutual friend, Jennie Block, who has also
worked so hard on issues of concern to the Haitian community.
I understand that the conference on the Inter-American Development Bank in Haiti went quite well. I was pleased to see
that the United Nations voted unanimously this week to extend the authorization for the U.N. Mission in Haiti for
another year.
I would also like to take a moment to express my condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in last
weekend's plane crash during a U.N. mission. The U.N. mission in Haiti has helped to play an important role in bringing
security and stability to some of the most dangerous neighborhoods in Haiti. I continue to support its mission and the
many men and women from around the world who work to carry it out.

However, it seems that Haiti just can't get to the next step. From assistance to debt relief, from trade benefits to
hurricane recovery, U.S. policy toward Haiti has run the gamut, but it is not achieving the long-term goals that we had
hoped for for the Haitian people and that the Haitian people want for themselves and their nation.
I am pleased to know that our State Department is taking'a closerlook at some of the challenges we are facing in Haiti.
Last week, Secretary Clinton's chief of staff and her point person on Haiti briefed Members on some of the initial
findings of this review.
I am confident that this review will help us to better understand how U.S. assistance to Haiti can be better targeted and
supportive of Haiti's own plans and goals; how assistance within the donor community can be better coordinated; how
the U.S. can better engage the Haitian Diaspora in our assistance efforts; and, finally, how the U.S. can finally make our
assistance sustainable so that outside efforts can ultimately be transferred into the hands of the Haitian government
and its people.
It is crucial that the efforts made by the U.S., the U.N. and others are effectively coordinated to ensure maximum
efficiency and maximum benefit for the people of Haiti. Innovative microcredit and microenterprise programs would
help to empower individuals, create self-reliance and create sustainability at the grassroots level. We should also look at
the very small-scale renewable energy programs for impoverished rural villages and settlements that are not served by
electric grids.
One of the immediate ways we can help the people of Haiti would be to grant temporary protected status to the
Haitians currently living in the U.S. Granting TPS to Haitians is the missing piece of a successful U.S. approach to
supporting the people of Haiti in the short and long term. I will continue to work with my colleagues to encourage the
administration to take this important step.
In addition, I will continue to support Haiti's inclusion in security initiatives, such as the Merida Initiative, to ensure that
the U.S. is doing all we can to help President Preval in his efforts against the narcotraffickers.
Success in Haiti is in the U.S. national security interest, and we must work together to help address the many challenges
we face and that our Caribbean neighbor faces day in and day out.

Daniel Yohannes will be in town on Tuesday. Not sure how hectic HRC's day is but would be good to have her get 30
minutes with him. I am going to schedule 30 minutes with him so she can either join or we can tack time on the
backend.
In addition, I am going to connect Steve and Daniel so they can meet in person on Tuesday — I likely will coordinate that
so that Steve joins before or after I meet with Daniel in case HRC wants to see both.

A Bold New Strategy for Smart Aid
Matthew Bishop is the New York bureau chief for The Economist magazine and, with Michael Green, he is author of the
2008 book, Philanthrocapitalism: How the Rich Can Save the World.
The Clinton Global Initiative's fifth birthday celebration this week may be a less glitzy affair than in previous
years but it marks an amazing comeback. Last year the Obama administration actually thought about having it
shut down as a price of Mrs. Clinton becoming Secretary of State, fearful that Bill's schmoozing of wealthy
philanthropists could compromise his wife's role as America's top diplomat. Now, Obama is going to be topping
the bill, outshining the A-list celebrities, heads of state and corporate titans who pack the hall for the annual
"Philanthropy Oscars."
Yet the most important speech at the event may not be delivered by either the current or the former president
but by Mrs. Clinton herself. She has said the State Department is going to forge new partnerships with
philanthropists to achieve America's foreign policy goals (and has already started work on a new initiative
around the Middle East peace process). Her speech is an opportunity to announce a radical new departure in the
way America gives aid.
The aid business in crisis. The past year may have been tough for the world's richest countries, but it has been
far harder for the poorest. Markets for exports have slumped as rich consumers have reined in their spending.
Government budgets are creaking under the strain of the global recession and foreign aid is threatening to dry
up. At the same time, the intellectual attack on aid has escalated, led by the author of "Dead Aid", the African
economist, Dambisa Moyo.
The CGI has become the showcase for those who believe Moyo is wrong and that aid can be effective. The CGI
is not about the old government-to-government aid model. Its members aim to deliver smart aid, based on
partnerships between business, philanthropists, and social entrepreneurs. Mrs. Clinton's speech is the perfect
opportunity to show that government is ready to work with the CGI crowd to rethink how it does aid.
One promising, for-profit solution to poverty is to take the model of microfinance -- one of the more resilient
corners of banking during the financial crisis -- and extend it to improve education, health care, clean water and
sanitation. Loan-based investments can be more sustainable than traditional aid or charity, because they tap the
far larger sums available in the capital markets and are not dependent on the whims of political leaders or

budgetary wrangling. Some in government may be reluctant to give up their near monopoly on aid but it is long
overdue.
A second opportunity is to get the public more involved in the aid business. New giving organizations such as
Kiva have demonstrated how the public can play an effective role in allocating money to needy people.
Government should be doing all it can to encourage his type of mass philanthrocapitalism that levers the
generosity of the American people and taps into the wisdom of crowds. It is time for government aid to be made
more democratic by letting Kiva and others like it distribute some of the tax dollars.
Finally, Mrs. Clinton should seize the opportunity to turn the aid business on its head and pass control from the
bureaucrats to the poor people themselves. Technology such as the internet and the mobile phone are now
widespread in the developing world, so why not use these tools to give a greater voice in aid spending to the
people the money is intended to help? Much aid has gone to waste because of a lack of feedback from the
intended beneficiaries. Imagine how the best technology entrepreneurs could transform the aid business, in the
same way that they have changed the media, by giving the poor a say in how the aid billions are spent.
The Obama Administration has made all the right noises about making government smarter by working more
with the philanthrocapitalists. At home, the creation of a White House Office of Social Innovation was a
welcome first move, yet it is still to be seen whether this will amount to much more than a new source of grant
funding for the nonprofit sector. The big win is in remaking government through innovative partnerships with
the private sector. Mrs Clinton has been mulling over what to do with USAID for nearly a year. What better
opportunity than the CGI to announce a bold new strategy for smart aid?

FYI, I have been informed by Eric Schmitt of the New York Times that the story regarding possible end use agreement
violations will run in tomorrow's paper. Based on a number of interactions over the past 48 hours, it will focus on the
array of Pakistan's efforts, including possible reconfiguration of US-provided systems without prior authorization, to
develop land-attack offensive missile options. The story will mention US-provided and indigenous Pakistani systems. In
response, we have highlighted the fact that we take this seriously; we took aggressive action when we became aware of
developments; we proactively engaged Pakistan at the highest levels; we kept Congress fully informed; and that Pakistan
has responded to our concerns and that there will be mutually-agreed inspections to address our concerns.

I just received a call from Arias. He expressed his appreciation for everything the US had done in support of democracy
in Honduras. He said the recent tough messages by Insulza, OAS Ambassadors and USG officials. strengthened by US
sanctions, was having an impact on the M regime. He praised our decision to close the consulate and urged that we also
move to take away tourist and business visas from key regime members and supporters. I told him we were working on
implementing the visa and other measures which I expected could be announced soon.
Arias was critical of Z saying his recent public statements continued to be unhelpful. He described Z's statement
advocating the death penalty (presumably to apply to his political enemies) and asking for the extension of his term in
office as "disastrous". He said that Insulza had made the right call by not allowing Z to address the OASGA. We agreed
the influence of FM Rodas over Z was highly negative,
I told Arias I would be back in Honduras tomorrow and planned in the coming days to press influential political, business
and civil society and urge support for the immediate signing of the Si Accord. Arias and I agreed to stay in close touch in
the coming days.

Biehi called a little after 1:30 pm to say the meeting with the de facto envoys had been abruptly cancelled -- but
for perhaps a positive reason.
Micheletti has asked about half the team to return to Tegucigalpa (Corrales stayed, as "he seeks to confirm that
he will not lose his visa"). In the phone call he got from the de facto envoys as they headed for the airport,
Biehl said he detected a positive attitude. The envoys seemed confident they would get M to sign the SJ
Accord. The envoys prmoised to call Biehi late this afternoon with the news from Honduras. If, if, if, if, the
news is positive, Biehl and OAS Political Director Victor Rico will leave for Tegucigalpa tomorrow morning to
meet Micheletti, make sure this is not another time-wasting tactic, and get something in writing from him that
he agrees to the Accord and will sign it.
Just before speaking to me, Biehl had spoken with Arias who expressed cautious optimisim that we might have
a break-through. Arias told Biehl to tell us, that if that happens the United States gets the credit.
Arias said the US has played the game exactly right, with the appropriate mix of carrots, sticks, toughness,
unified message, even-handedness and, above all, good timing. Arias said the Europeans have been calling him
over the past two days, and have fallen into line with the US; the Swedes, as head of the EU, and have told him
that they will take their cue from the US and will support US actions. Arias, Biehi said, was extremely
complimentary of the "great political instincts shown by Secretary Clinton."

Holbrooke's Contributions on Af/Pak
Holbrooke has assembled an unprecedented interagency team to carry out the work on
Af/Pak — a whole-of-government team in DC and a reorganized and reenergized U.S.
mission in Kabul.
Holbrooke's team is actually getting things done, including the implementation of more
than 20 detailed action plans. Some examples of the work thus far:
• The civilian surge in Afghanistan is on pace to meet targets by end of year.
• Our approach to assistance in Afghanistan has changed dramatically, both through the
consolidation of efforts under Tony Wayne and the review (and sometimes rejection) of
assistance contracts.
•
• Holbrooke has opened and is actively pursuing R/R channels.
• The swift and comprehensive U.S. response helped alleviate and reduce the impact of the
Swat refugee crisis.
•
• The trilateral meetings have helped create conditions for progress on key cross-border
issues.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764934 Date: 07/31/2015
• Holbrooke's international diplomacy — in the Gulf, with China, with the cadre of other
special representatives — has translated into funding and equipment commitments, more
buy-in, and more patience.
Holbrooke has been a key driver of (non-military) strategic innovation in Afghanistan and
Pakistan. Here are some examples:Ill
Defining a regional approach to Af/Pak (including trilateral summits)
• The regional approach championed by Holbrooke became a central feature of the Reidel
report; the trilats are a pure Holbrooke invention
Afghanistan
The clearest voice and thinker on swifter and more heavily resourced "Afghanization" -
primarily by standing up a sufficiently large and sufficiently capable ANSF — as the preferable
alternative to adding more troops.
• The Reidel report calls for training 134,000 army and 82,000 police over two years;
Holbrooke is working through a strategy that would more than double those numbers and
speed the pace of training. Such a strategy has to resolve significant obstacles,
particularly with respect to the police.
Framing and executing the U.S. approach to Afghan elections:
•
Developing a strategy — in partnership with the Afghan government and others — for pursuing
reconciliation/reintegration.
• The Reidel report discusses support for the Afghan government's efforts to reintegrate
"non ideologically-committed" insurgents who lay down their arms, renounce al Qaeda,
and accept the Afghan Constitution. Holbrooke was key in developing this aspect of the
report, and is now working through the next phases.
Prioritizing a shift in emphasis on counternarcotics from eradication to interdiction
• The Reidel report discusses the need for increased interdiction efforts — and the attendant
need to support licit agriculture to shift livelihoods.
Emphasizing and executing our engagement with Arab allies, China, and Turkey

• The Reidel report speaks generally about engaging all those with a stake in the region. It
does not lay out a specific diplomatic strategy or priority countries.
• [NOTE:
• This issue does not get extensive treatment in the Reidel report.
Pakistan
• The Reidel report does not speak in any detail to this issue.
Responding decisively to the refugee crisis in Swat and Buner
• Obviously, the Reidel report does not address this. The immediate response to the
refugee crisis was Holbrooke's team at its finest.
Making the image of the United States in Pakistan as a critical strategic priority
• The Reidel report focuses on strategic communications in Afghanistan. Holbrooke's
recent trip with Judith McHale is the latest in an ongoing effort to develop a strategic
communications plan for Pakistan. Generally, Holbrooke, along with McDonough, has
been the key mover on all things related to strategic communications in both Afghanistan
and Pakistan; he has a good sense of what is missing and what is needed.
Pursuing a major new energy initiative to address Pakistan's economic troubles and boost
support for the United States
• The Reidel report mentions energy as a key sector where we should be encouraging
foreign investment.

Subject: Shannon & Valenzuela -- DeMint Staff Mtg
Cheryl,
Rich and I met this morning with Chris Socha, Senator DeMint's foreign policy staffer. We took the
opportunity to discuss the nominations of Tom Shannon and Arturo Valenzuela. As you know, DeMint has
been very outspoken regarding Zelaya's ouster in Honduras.
With respect to Tom, it appears as though little has changed - DeMint still appears to be insisting on some
amount of floor debate followed by a roll call vote on the nomination. How much time and when is still
something that needs to be worked out. We've been following up on our end, but the DeMint camp has
slow walked things a bit. We expect to come to some agreement when the Senate reconvenes.
Arturo's nomination is in a different posture. As we approached the Senate's August recess, there
appeared to be some loosening of DeMint's hold on him. After speaking with DeMint's staff, we're still
hopeful that we could get Arturo confirmed by either voice vote or by unanimous consent when the Senate
returns. However, Chris warned that DeMint is monitoring closely the Administration's position
with regards to sanctions. He warned that if a coup determination is made and new sanctions
levied, this could very well have an adverse impact on how Arturo's nomination moves forward.
We wanted to alert you to this latter point because we understand a determination from L
could be coming down shortly.
DeMint's staffer explained that the Senator would welcome a call from either S or Deputy Steinberg, and
he thought a call could go a long way to freeing up Arturo's nomination. We're preparing a call sheet for
Deputy Steinberg.
Thanks.

Erica, we are of course always ready to help. But I have to say the way in which these papers have been tasked has
been, frankly, chaotic. For two Fridays in a row we were sent taskers after 9 or 10 pm with short deadlines, and fulfillment
of one set of requirements has only led to another. We also note that there has not generally been an effort to distinguish
among bureaus in terms of substantive responsibilities and NEA has repeatedly had to refer USUN-W to other bureaus,
especially PRM and somewhat mystifyingly, 10.
I am honestly not quite sure what is needed now. There is already an 10-drafted paper on Israel in the UN that I cleared
Friday evening. Are you asking us to script her on that topic for her meetings? I doubt very much that Ambassador Rice's
interlocutors will seek to draw her into a discussion of the Israeli or Palestinian economies and I can't think why she would
raise that topic with them and what policy points we would expect her to make in the context of her visit. If you really need
background papers on the two economies, we can give you them.
We'll work on the BCLs at 00B Monday with input from posts. Our aim is to provide Amb Rice maximum support. Best,

Your folks have been terrific (especially Oni and Tom's team) in working with us yesterday and today to get papers ready
for the trip. We continue to scrounge up the last bits and pieces from the field and here, but we've given the main
briefing books to Amb. Rice who is digesting them now, and we'll get her add ons tomorrow.
After going through things briefly with her this afternoon, there is one request that we have on the substantive
front. We'd like to get (at whatever classification level is appropriate) really two additional meaty papers for her
meetings with Netanyahu and Liberman. These would supplement the material in her book. We are aware that these
will be tough meetings, but we also view them as a good opportunity to also cover a lot of ground. There are a lot of
issues not in the current papers that could come up: from Israel in the UN system, to Iran, to settlements, to the
current Temple Mount crisis, to the Israel and Palestinian economies, to the security barrier, etc.. Tom and his team
may have additional issues they'd like her to raise as well. She'd like to be over prepared for these meetings and
realizes that the SBU format has not given your team the latitude to get that done.
In these two cases could we get classified supplemental for her BCLs with lots of background, TPs, etc. Please blow off
any length requirements, etc. — longer and more comprehensive is better in this case.
We know that doing these over the weekend is unreasonable. We can arrange to get these to her after she lands in
Israel. Would it be possible — on the high side — to get these two additional pieces by COB Monday?

Re: Branch Book
Overview:
There are few surprises in this book. The "surprises" that might exist are buried and took a close reading to pick
up on—the two main ones are about the terror clause of WJC's crime bill and why he hadn't disclosed
information about Lewinsky (because he hadn't wanted to become a witness against her). There are a lot of
things that have been covered in My Life and other publications. Quite honestly the book was pretty boring and
much more focused on Branch than I had anticipated. While not as "and this day, and the next day" as My Life,
it does share many of the same elements that would engage only a true Clinton fanatic or historian. The fact that
there appears to be no index also makes it difficult for anyone looking for a quick hit to get one. Furthermore,
WJC's words are so interlaced with Branch's recollection through his dictations, that the number of direct WJC
quotes was far fewer than I had expected.
HRC was not as much of a player as one might imagine. Her role is largely seen through her interactions with
Branch when he is recording WJC. Her statements were consistent with the past, with the exception of the
Gephardt comment, and didn't grab much attention at all.Ell (Others included HRC's devotion to CVC, thought
that there should not be a special prosecutor and images of her returning from meetings. They were pretty much
aligned with her interactions with Branch.) Surprisingly, or not surprisingly, many of the problems discussed in
the book are those, which face the current Administration—Middle East peace, North Korea, China, etc...
Branch repeatedly injects his feelings on specific subjects and seems to use the book to voice his own opinion
of the Administration and events of the time. He clearly has topics he prefers over others (for example his
connection with the events in Haiti result in a lot of discussion about it), but there are some subjects that are
strikingly sparsely discussed such as Rwanda. Its absence from long discussions was surprising, but it did not
appear as thought WJC ever-dodged questions about the topic, they just weren't addressed. Much like My Life,
one theme that repeated itself was WJC's conflict with and disdain for the media, especially long passages
about NYT and Washington Post. There are a few instances where gives them credit on their reporting, but you
would be hard-pressed to find them. Additionally, there are numerous mentions of WJC's acute allergies and his
chronic fatigue, with imagery of him falling asleep in sessions on more than a couple occasions.
The book has quite a bit on Whitewater, but given the dearth of public documentation there is little that Branch
could write that hadn't been said. One thing I had not recalled was the D'Amato's subpoena of CVC's friends,
later quashed, who slept over while HRC's Rose Law Firm records were in the White House. Branch does
portray a helpful distinction in how WJC looked at Whitewater and other scandals. While WJC attacks
Whitewater as a political hunt, Branch does have him WJC saying that Filegate needed to be separated from
Whitewater, because this was a legitimate inquiry. There are some quips that could catch someone's eye, such
as WJC referring to Paula Jones as "a 'new bimbo' he [WJC] didn't even recognize."

Branch does not dwell on Lewinsky or the impeachment. With the exception of Bruce, Bennett and Kendall, no
other lawyers are mentioned. There is one passage that I am looking into, in which WJC says part of the reason
he didn't mention his relationship with Lewinsky at first was because she was being threatened with jail time if
she was found to be lying under oath and had he told the truth he could become a witness against her. This is a
very small passage that could easily be missed, but one that it is important to note as I don't recall hearing this
before. (This is addressed more fully below.)
There are a few relationships that track through the book more than others. They include WJC's relationship
with Gore, which maps in part because it is not a focal point until the end, and his contentious relationship with
Janet Reno. The one Senator that appears to be most discussed negatively is Moynihan. All three of these issues
are discussed in turn below. WJC is portrayed as an extremely loving and attentive father and HRC is portrayed
in a much more human light than other books/articles covering this time period, with ample mention of her
relationship with CVC and images of affection between her and WJC, both pre- and post-impeachment.
On foreign relations there is a lot of time spent discussing the Middle East, Northern Ireland, the Balkans,
China, Russia, Pakistan/India and in the beginning of the book, Haiti. (Note: Much of what is written about
Haiti is about Branch's own experience there and on the subject.) There is also a fair amount of discussion
about North Korea, but nothing that has not been discussed in the past few weeks. Bin Laden is discussed in
what seems to track mention of him in My Life, which seems to have more detail and background than this
book.
In certain cases there is more detail here than in My Life, for example on his trip to Pakistan WJC wrote that the
USSS cancelled one stop because they would be "defenseless" flying in, whereas Brach writes that the streets
would be lined with "assassins." There are candid looks at WJC's take on certain people and the relationship
between some, such as Albright and Berger's dislike of Holbrooke, and a more detailed depiction of Yeltsin's
drinking, such as yelling outside of Blair House for a cab to get pizza.
One thing to note, is that often times WJC seems to be speaking to Branch intentionally without the recorders
going, but Branch writes about those interactions and exchanges nonetheless. Such is the case with HRC's
Gephardt comment.

Wen Ho Lee and Terror Clause of Crime Bill
In discussing Wen Ho Lee's release Branch characterizes WJC's lack of knowledge about the strained
interpretation of the anti-terrorist provisions in the crime bill and arbitrary detentions as a "confession." My Life
only mentions Lee's accusation in passing and does not again discuss Lee. Below are two passages from
Branch's book the first giving context and the second about the Terror Clause of the Crime Bill.
➢ The year closed on spies and terrorism. The Justice Department, after fierce debate among the security
agencies, indicted nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee on fifty-nine counts of copying classified material to his
personal computer. Lee was being handled like a radioactive espionage defendant—no bail, lockdown,
solitary confinement—even though the long dragnet had produced no evidence that he offered secrets to
China or anyone else. The president said experts were telling him the worst spies sometimes stored their
treason for a rainy day. This sounded fishy to me. Clinton shrugged. Nothing would please him more
than to establish Lee's innocence. [Branch, 577]
➢ While Lee was indicted, Branch writes that WJC noted that others "were being held in secret, uncharged
and untried...He [WJC] was embarrassed not to have sponsored this measure into law without
foreseeing such arbitrary detentions...Under the terrorist act, any prosecutor should decide within the
legal limit...whether to bring charges on the testimony of a secret informant or otherwise. To his
dismay, Clinton had learned of defendants held incommunicado for more than six months. One extreme
detention had last three years. 'I think it's wrong,' he [WJC] said. 'It's not American. We accept guilty
people on the street to enjoy and protect our freedom.' [Branch, 629]
WJC and Lewinsky's Silence
Branch writes that part of WJC's motive for not discussing what had happened with Lewinsky was that it could
send her to jail, as she had denied it.
➢ "Also, he pointed out that Starr had been threatening to jail Lewinsky all year over her sworn denial of
the affair. If Clinton had come forward with anything at all about their relationship, he said Starr could
have turned him into a witness against Lewinsky, betraying her discreet silence. Such subtleties, while
original, struck me as tendentious. The president never claimed chivalry as the real motive for his
steadfast denial, nor did he dispute the essential truth of Lewinsky's account." [Branch, 511]
HRC and Kissinger
The following could be fodder for people who want to continue to string along the notion of channeling Eleanor
Roosevelt.
➢ There is a passage in which HRC describes an exchange she had with Kissinger at a dinner where he
complained that if the health care bill passed he wouldn't be able to see his own doctor. She continued to
say "it was interesting, in fact, that she had dreamed about Kissinger only a few nights before. His
visage turned suddenly effervescent at a banquet, announcing gladly that his worries were over because
the Clinton health care bill was dying. 'Oh, no, Dr. Kissinger,' she replied coolly. 'Don't be sure that it's
dead. We'll keep fighting, and there's always light at the end of the tunnel.' She said Kissing blanched,
speechless at her deft reminder of the Vietnam War...Now at last, in Hillary's dream, it registered that
his strategic designs had spewed carnage and venom for seven needless years...'That's what I dreamed,'
Hillary repeated, lost in thought. 'You know, I always get my revenge in dreams, but never in real life.'
[Branch, 179]
HRC and gay/lesbian

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764995 Date: 07/31/2015
Writing about a call with HRC from NYS, Branch recalls how WJC's counsel got very "exercised." WJC left
the room. "He was subdued on his return. 'You know, I've had a lot more contact with gay people in my life
than Hillary.' He sighed. Her temperament had a conservative, religious core, formed before homosexual issues
were even mentionable. New York politics was a tough crucible, and she was unsure what heat she could take.
On the other hand, personal experience could speed adaptation." [Branch, 551]
Tension with Moynihan
There are several occasions throughout the book that Branch recalls WJC's grievances and frustration with
Moynihan. For example:
> When Moynihan called for the international arms embargo to be unilaterally lifted so that Bosnia could
fight for themselves, Branch writes, "The president flinched when I mentioned [it]...'That's just a
freebie for him,' snapped Clinton, 'and he knows it.'" [p.140]
> In regard to health care: "Echoing comments by Hillary at dinner, he [WJC] faulted Senator Moynihan
for aimless hearings conducted without a strategy or theme." [p.170]
➢ Discussing Independent Counsel: "She [HRC] was especially scornful of the Democrats, and quoted a
number of them. Senator Moynihan, for instance, publicly said the Clintons were nice people and he was
sure they had nothing to hide. 'Why not have an investigation?' he often asked. She said Moynihan
skated blithely on the surface, never produced results in Congress, and could not withstand such scrutiny
himself for five minutes, living in an apartment secured through his chairmanship of the Pennsylvania
Avenue Development Corporation." [Brach, 182]
➢ "Donnybrook" argument in which Moynihan said of a fundraising speech WJC gave citing a regretted
hypothetical about a controversial decision. Moynihan told the press, "He doesn't understand...that he's
conceding the principles." WJC confronted him about lack of context given to the statement to the press
and said that Moynihan knew what he was doing by "feeding the beast of hostile presumption about
Clinton's motives." [Branch, 299]
HRC as World Player
There are several images as HRC as a player on the world stage, both with WJC and on her own. Several
examples follow:
➢ Middle East: Discussing peace with King Hussein: "They had retreated for lunch as two couples—the
Clintons, with the king and his wife, Queen Noor—in the family dining room... Their agenda was a
delicate race between Hussein's failing health and his desire to make peace with Israel. The president
said he and Hillary pounded away on symptoms of national estrangement: closed boarders, water
disputes, travel barriers, war grievances, contested airspace, sealed electrical grids, and so on. Hussein
gave them a feast of goodwill without commitment on any point." [Branch, 170]
> South Asia: Regarding her trip to South Asia with CVC in 1995, "Her [HRC's] schedule was far more
demanding than ceremonial, pushing both conflict resolution and civic empowerment for downtrodden
women." [Branch, 236] Later Branch tells of Benazir Bhutto praising CVC and HRC. "By contrast with
a superficial American press, which portrayed Hillary as a demure tourist of no policy significance in
exotic Asia, Bhutto said she had touched essential political chords with whirlwind encouragements for
citizenship groups and small-scale economic development." (The note contrasting Bhutto corresponds to
a NYT article which Branch quotes in the footer saying, "she [HRC] played the traditional role of First
Lady as wife and mother...") [Branch, 246]

> China Speech: Branch outlines how HRC felt the speech needed to be bigger than China and how she
depicted the "harsh reality everywhere" from China to Africa. He then cites WJC commenting on the
rave reviews of HRC's speech. [Branch, 289]
➢ Regarding the Russian financial system meltdown, Branch writes "Yeltsin seemed so removed from
urgent political tasks that both Clintons counseled him directly." [Branch, 512-513]
Jesse Jackson
Branch writes about Jesse Jackson calling CVC after the Lewinsky story broke and having continued contact
with her throughout the period. WJC thanks him for his support of CVC. This goes into some detail about WJCs
gratitude, but the fact that Jackson "counseled" CVC has been public knowledge dating back to at least 1999.
➢ "But now Jesse had done something he would not forget. When the Lewinsky news broke, he called
Chelsea at Stanford. Jesse was the only nonfamily adult with her cell phone number. How he got it was
another story. Jesse said he knew this was terrible for her. Nothing like it had ever happened in
American politics. He did not know everything involved, but he wanted to remind Chelsea how much
her parents loved her. Their family needed to stick together now above all, and if she needed to counsel,
rage, or pray, he was always available." [Branch, 497]
Tension with Janet Reno
Throughout the book, from his nomination of her, WJC is portrayed as having no opinion to having a negative
opinion of Janet Reno.
> "He complained about Janet Reno—made it clear, in fact, that he felt alienated from his own attorney
general. If he removed her, however, the pending decision on yet another special prosecutor [for 1996
campaign finance] would fall to Reno's deputy, Jamie Gorelick, who, Clinton feared, may share Reno's
wholesale devotion to outside control for any case in which the president himself may become a
target...If he removed both Reno and Gorelick, to start fresh, it would touch off a firestorm of protest
like Nixon's Saturday Night Massacre of the Justice Department officials during the Watergate scandal.
That was not an option." [Branch, 388-389]
> Branch writes about WJC talking about Reno and Louis Freeh disregarding a letter from D'Amato and
continuing to allow independent counsel to go after Ciseneros. The same held true for Mike Espy.
Branch then outlines a meeting between WJC and Reno. Reno had made public statements about her
"desire to stay on the job. 'I told her I didn't like that one damn bit,' the president said tersely. 'I didn't
hire her to work for the New York Times and Washington Post. I hired her to work for me.'" [Branch,
398] He continues to outline that Clinton did give Reno credit for some good achievements including
coordination with U.S. attorneys and that he didn't blame her for the special prosecutor on Whitewater,
but that "he did blame her for abdicating responsibility to supervise the investigations ever since, letting
mandates multiply almost at will. She accepted criteria that were ludicrous and crassly partisan. Reno
had failed to defend the presidency itself—not Clinton personally, but the institution—and by extension
the entire executive branch...He told me she had no clue what he meant. His advisers considered her
more naïve than upright, and the fuzziness of the distinction seemed to save her." [Branch, 399] He cites
that Clinton warned her that she should prepare herself for not staying in the job for the entire second
term.
Portrayal of Jimmy Carter

There are parallels that could be drawn between WJC/BHO and Carter/WJC both in terms of Carter's trip to
North Korea and the mission he went on to Haiti. WJC clearly was frustrated by Carter's seeming desire to be
on the front lines.
North Korea:
➢ "On North Korea, he [WJC] said Jimmy Carter had initiated his own recent trip with a call to Al Gore,
and Clinton had approved the volunteer mission to break through North Korea's extreme
isolation... Sure enough, Carter did reach North Korean dictator Kim Il-sung, who proposed to allow
inspection of North Korea's nuclear facilities in exchange for relief from the harsh economic sanctions.
The only hitch was that Carter announced the terms on CNN before they became official, adding
gratuitously that he never had agreed with sanctions in the first place. News stories had the White House
seething, but Clinton made light of the spat. He said the deal was since ratified by an exchange of letters,
and he did not believe Carter would criticize official policy 'if the game were still in doubt.' [Branch,
162]
Haiti:
➢ After pushing to be sent to Haiti and enlisting Colin Powell and Sam Nunn to get WJC to break with
Gore (who said Carter shouldn't be trusted a second time) and Christopher and approve the mission to
Haiti to seek a truce with the junta, Carter is portrayed as acting stubbornly and having 'clientitis'
(arguing for acceptance of Haitian generals versus what was in the United States' best interest). He
didn't want to leave and WJC told him he had to. Like after North Korea, Carter again, Carter went to
the press first. "The three negotiators flew back to Washington late Sunday, and Carter, invited to stay
over at the White House, called CNN's Judy Woodruff after midnight to arrange an interview the next
morning before he reported to Clinton on his mission. This conduct, the president said tersely, was not
right...The press was full of retrospective stories about friction between him and his three prominent
negotiators...He said the current newsweeklies lapped up criticism by Carter as an embarrassment to
Clinton...Many of his advisers griped that Jimmy Carter thought he was still president, but Clinton
found this criticism too jaundiced. Carter had spoken with restraint at their joint press conference, he
allowed, exhibiting a keen political ear...To Clinton, Carter simply felt that he had earned the right to
speak his mind as an international statesman, even about a mission he had accepted for the United States
government complete with an Air Force jet. This sense of entitlement could make Carter a thorn, but
Clinton thought his value far outweighed the political annoyance. He considered Carter a sterling ex-
resident." [Branch, 200-201]
Dispatch of Bombers Near Iraq
➢ "He expected military strikes to win bipartisan assent, including former presidents Ford, Reagan and
Bush. 'Dole will support me,' he said. 'Carter will probably criticize me. Carter always criticizes, but he
doesn't have much positive to say." [Branch, 518]
Gore
For the majority of the book, there is little discussion of WJC and Gore's relationship. There are few places
where he is briefly mentioned and a couple of scenes with some levity. The end, however, describes the
seemingly brutally candid conversation between the two about the 2000 election and the impeachment.
➢ On page 92 Branch writes, "No, he [Clinton] did not ask Gore to take over a failed foreign policy, as
alleged, but to improve public presentations by his troika of 'bad talkers': shy National Security Adviser
Tony Lake, boring Secretary of State Warren Christopher, and disorganized Defense Secretary Les
Aspin." [Branch, 92]

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764995 Date: 07/31/2015
➢ In one-passage WJC talks about asking Gore to lead the independent review of Hazel O'Leary and also
having Gore substitute for him at an economic conference in Japan. The latter did not fare well as other
nations were offended that Gore, not WJC attended. Gore insisted that WJC needed to go to Japan to
redeem himself and the administration for his absence. Gore pointed to a few days in January, but WJC
"pronounced them vital to Chelsea's schoolwork. Gore blinked. So what?...Mutual exasperation spiked.
`Al,' Clinton told him, 'I am not going to Japan and leave Chelsea by herself to take these exams.' Gore
erupted. He thought Clinton had lost his bearing. They had a big fight, said the president, and were still
wrangling about dates for Japan." Branch states that this fight wound up being around the time WJC saw
Lewinsky. [Branch, 316-317]
➢ On page 396-397 there is a scene, which shows Gore's sense of humor and Gore, WJC, et al working as
a team to secure the Cabinet for the second term.
➢ Later there is a passage about an exchange between WJC and HRC about Gore trying to hire a second
criminal lawyer. HRC already knew he was paying the first one $30,000 per month. The conversation is
about a leak of an offer from Jim Neal of TN, the former Watergate prosecutor to defend Gore for free.
The exchange is more on ethics of the offer and its leak to the press than about Gore.
➢ On Gore's announcing his campaign. "The president had called twice to congratulate Gore for his
kickoff events—once from Geneva, hours later from Paris. Clinton thought the only glitches were
technical... But Gore got all the big things right. His twofold message was perfect: distinguish himself
from Clinton's personal flaws, and tell voters exactly what he would do for them in the White House.
The president said it was fine for Gore to call Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky 'inexcusable.'
First, it was true. Second, it showed a necessary strength to criticized the boss. Third, Gore would be
badgered to death until he did. 'Al,' Clinton told him, 'if you thought it would help in the campaign, I
would let you flog me at noon right on the doorstep of the Washington Post.'" [Branch, 553-554]
Branch continues that WJC told Gore to ignore reporting that he was offended or critical of his
campaign. "On tape, the president said he confided his chief strategic worry only to Gore himself and to
Gore's pollster, Mark Penn. The vice president must project his platform—where he stood, precisely
how and where he would lead the country—because the Republicans would try to knock him off
substance." [Branch, 554]
➢ WJC offered critiques of Gore's campaign throughout, but it was always framed as his fear of Gore not
succeeding him. For example, "Clinton still thought Gore could win. Most people considered him smart,
experience, and motivated. He examined the pitfalls for Gore in a campaign showcasing presidential
character over detailed agendas for the country. Reporters called Gore "stiff," but Clinton discounted
this liability. He thought Gore's droll sense of humor would wear well over time. Gore also was
perceived to be too conventional a Democrat, therefore lacking independence, which called for Gore to
emphasize more his own passion and initiatives. Then the president said Gore could have a brooding
quality about him, not worrisome or off-putting in itself, but potentially damaging if his serious nature
failed to give voters a lifted. Clinton isolated the word "sunny." Gore needed more of it." [Branch, 599]
➢ He also complimented Gore's knowledge of government workings. "Gore knew Washington. Believe
me, said the president, his administration would have made many more errors in the first two years had
it not been for the vice president." He then goes on to say that WJC suggested Gore find someone who
would be a bright spot to run with, perhaps Durbin or Bradley or Kerrey, although he also goes into
great detail about the virtues of Mikulski, even though she would never get chosen. How much of this
was WJC's emphasis versus Branch's focus on his home state senator is unclear. [Branch, 599, 618-19]
➢ WJC criticized Gore for not running on the successes of the administration. "They should be running
essentially for a third term, said the president, but they were afraid the Clinton-Gore record would

tarnish them with Clinton's character." [Branch, 623] Branch gives WJC's critique of Gore in debate
that had been heard before—that Gore lacked style and a light touch.
➢ Branch has WJC recalling a conversation between WJC and Gore where "Gore had bared himself in one
of their stressful consultations by insisting that he, Gore, was a good politician, elaborating that he
meant good on the policy, and also good on the politics, but admitted that he did not instinctively blend
the two. Gore said he had to think about it, and Clinton thought this was pretty close to the bone...He
had the stuff to be a great president, and this was the message that Clinton must convey somehow
without seeming to brag on his own record." [Branch, 623-624]
➢ The big passage about Gore begins on page 641 and extends to 645. Branch notes that WJC was unsure
at first about recording the details. At the outset it says, "For his own part, Gore was not angry, nor did
he blame Clinton for his defeat, but he wanted to acknowledge forthrightly that some people around him
did." [Branch, 642] It has WJC acknowledging that Gore's use of him was proper—he was best in the
White House. Then he says, "'I think you made a mistake not to use me more in the last ten days,'"
Clinton told Gore, 'but otherwise that was not a big deal. I was much more upset about your message,
now that we're being honest.'" [Branch, 642] Branch recalls WJC saying Gore fought bag saying that
"Clinton's drag plagued every direction." Clinton then said that Gore was better at governance than
Clinton, and Gore would be better for the nation than Bush, and that he was an "unparalleled" vice
president, but that he had "blind spots." Branch writes that WJC kept saying their confrontation was
"surreal."
o Gore had a "fresh grievance...he wanted Clinton to know that the Buddhist temple fund-raising
scandal had been the worst experience of his life. No one had ever questioned his personal
integrity, but corrosive publicity and whispers had tormented him now for four years. Gore said
he had not been disposed to blame Clinton. However, he remembered telling the president that
he found himself the only English-speaking person at one of those Asian fund-raisers. And the
president was in charge of the party apparatus that was supposed to screen all the donations for
trouble. So he did blame Clinton in a way. The president told me he could scarcely believe the
ensuing tales of suspicion. Gore must still be in shock from the election, or unhinged. 'I thought
he was in Neverland,' he said." [Branch, 643-644]
o Branch continues: "The vice president asked Clinton about Monica Lewinsky. He had supported
Clinton all through the impeachment, publicly and privately, while declaring himself
disappointed. Yes, said the president. He appreciated that. However, persisted Gore, Clinton did
not confide any personal feelings. He never explained exactly what happened. There was little to
say, Clinton replied, beyond failure and regret. He was humiliated and angry, had made mistake.
He had misled the American people, and he was sorry. Gore closed his point with emphasis.
Well, he said, this is the first time you have apologized to me personally. Clinton did a double
take...Gore treated the confession as a watershed. Their colliding perspectives made both of
them angry. Clinton exploded that Gore's reaction was phony. What was so significant
here?...Gore exploded back. He was feeling a stubborn repeat of the defensiveness and delayed
honesty that somehow cost the election. Clinton's character was at the root of it..." [Branch,
644-45]

> HRC and Haiti Invasion: Branch asked WJC what HRC thought about his foreign policy team's
suggestion to invade Haiti. "He said the pell-mell rush to invade was crazy to her. Reacting against the
pressure, the lack of options, and his sense of being trapped, she said he was badly served by his foreign
policy staff. He said she observed with some suspicion that the chief sponsors of the invasion—Lake,
Berger, and Talbott—were the same people who had pushed the ill-fated appointment of Bobby Ray
Inman as defense secretary." [Branch, 189]
> ITAV: ITAV co-author flap in which Sally Quinn spread rumors that HRC had not written the book.
Quinn said that HRC had denied credit to the book's collaborator, Barbara Feinman, a friend of Quinn.
HRC said Feinman had withdrawn from the project. Branch notes that the White House had draft
chapters in HRC's handwriting. (Branch turned this to be about him and how it affected him as a
ghostwriter.) From this HRC said that Quinn and her friends launched a rumor that HRC and a female
veterinarian of Socks' were "discovered...in flagrante on a bedroom floor in the White House." [Branch,
342-343]
> Subpoenas of CVC's Friends: Branch tells of how D'Amato, as Chair of the Banking Committee, had
subpoenaed all those who might have been in the White House when HRC's Rose firm records were
there. This included "some two dozen of Chelsea's sleepovers." Senator Sarbanes quashed the
subpoenas for the sleepovers. [Branch, 362]
➢ Vernon Jordan Extramarital Sex: In the context of Lewinsky, Branch says of Vernon Jordan, "In our
glancing associations, I had picked up from Vernon an attitude toward extramarital sex best described as
lighthearted or recreational." [Branch, 495]
> Gore/HRC ticket: "By the numbers, and Clinton's gut, a Gore-Hillary ticket would give Democrats their
best chance to defeat Bush for the White House. 'Hands down,' he [WJC] said, tut I don't think Al
would ever do it.'" [Branch, 540]
> WJC suggesting Rubin run for NY Senate seat: The passage comes after WJC talks about supporting
HRC if she decided to run, which raises a question of whether he had preferred Rubin or whether the
two events are unconnected. "When the president had urged him [Rubin] to run for and easily win the
New York Senate seat, Rubin recoiled...He could not fathom why Hillary wanted to run now..."
[Branch, 557]
➢ On trip to South Asia: Branch says that WJC agreed to cancel a stop in Bangladesh, because "of hard
intelligence that Osama bin Laden had lined the route with assassins." [Branch, 594] My Life discusses
the cancelled trip but does not specify it was because of bin Laden or assassins.
DI 'Gephardt is an asshole," Hillary commented. The president, pointing to my recorders, advised gently that the tapes were on. She
winced but shrugged with a smile. "Well, he is," she insisted. In an awkward silence, I backed up both machines to erase the first
lady's epithet." [Branch, 263]

On Monday, DS will be ordering Armor Group to terminate 4 more individuals from the Kabul contract. The terminations
are a direct result of the investigation, as there is clear evidence that all 4 were either involved in or aware of events that
violated expectations for appropriate conduct, while serving in a supervisory capacity. They are all being terminated for
violating the standards of conduct clause.
The terminations are being handled to ensure that there are no gaps in coverage of essential positions (which may delay
the departure of one from Kabul for a few days).
DS is putting together press guidance on the terminations.

Reasonable people can disagree on whatever it was
By Al Kamen
Monday, October 19, 2009
They call it the World's Greatest Deliberative Body (WGDB), Part I.
The Senate Judiciary Committee last week was reviewing an amendment by Sen. Richard Durbin (D-I11.) to the
USA Patriot Act to clarify the legal standard needed for an investigation under the act. The amendment was
intended to provide greater protections from abuse by investigators.
His colleague, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), spoke in opposition, agreeing with committee Chairman Patrick
Leahy (D-Vt.) and ranking Republican Jeff Sessions (Ala.) that additional protections are not needed.
"I would just point to the actual language in here," Klobuchar said, "which is, it's not like this is some pie-in-
the-sky standard here. I mean, it specifically says," she noted approvingly, reading aloud from the bill, that there
have to be "reasonable grounds to believe that the information sought is relevant to an authorized national
security investigation," and you can't investigate someone just for exercising free speech rights and there's got
to be some suspected foreign agent involved.
"So I just, for anyone listening to this, it is not like there is no standard," she concluded. "There is a standard in
place here."
"That's the standard that is in the bill now?" Sessions asked.
Klobuchar nodded that it was.
No it's not, Durbin interrupted. "Senator Klobuchar, you just read my amendment," not the bill, he said -- "and I
think it's critically important that you understand what we're establishing here."
Whatever. Klobuchar voted against the amendment, which got only a handful of votes anyway.
Blame the gatekeeper
The usual pattern at the State Department is that the new secretary arrives at Foggy Bottom for the first day of
work and enters to rousing cheers from career Foreign Service folks hoping the new boss will actually heed
their expert advice. (They are, by nature, an optimistic crowd.)

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765054 Date: 07/31/2015
Then, after 7 months, 8 days and 12 hours, on average, the grumbling begins that the secretary is "not
accessible" to senior career folks, that she's overly protected by her personal staff, that the promised "open
door" has slammed shut. The fingers start pointing, usually at the secretary's chief of staff. These days, that's
Cheryl Mills, who holds that post for Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.
We're hearing complaints even from members of the inner circle that the overworked Mills -- chief of staff,
counselor, overseer of Haiti policy and food security policy and the department motor pool (okay, not really) --
has made entry to Clinton's suite something like penetrating the Green Zone in Baghdad.
Not so, says Undersecretary of State William Burns, the department's top career official. "This secretary is in
touch every day with as many people across the department as possible, and Cheryl is a big part of making that
happen."
Another senior State official said Clinton has been on the road a lot: Asia in July and Africa in August and
Ireland and Moscow just the other day, and soon she'll be back on the road, pretty much until Thanksgiving.
There have also been a bunch of meetings of late on AfPak matters.
Hey, just telling you what we're hearing.
In a timely fashion ...
The Loop Better-Late-Than-Never award this year goes to the State Department's personnel bureau. The bureau,
in an Oct. 13 notice, said it had awarded a $1.6 million contract to Campion Services Inc. in West Lafayette,
Ind., to "assist the department in ensuring that all examinations for Foreign Service [jobs] have been
professionally validated and constitute a reliable means of identifying those applicants with the greatest
possibility of success in the foreign service."
Well, good thing the department's only been hiring for a couple of hundred years.
The rest of the résumé
The White House last week announced that President Obama had selected Jessie H. Roberson, a nuclear expert
and senior vice president of environmental affairs for the Atlantic Sea Island Group, to be a member of the
Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. The bio notes her previous jobs, even her undergraduate degree in
nuclear engineering.
Name sounds familiar. Roberson, Roberson: Wasn't she Dubya's appointee as assistant secretary of the Energy
Department for environmental management, the $6 billion-a-year weapons cleanup program? That's not
mentioned in the White House release, but she was there from 2001 to 2004.
Waterboarding for kids?
WGDB, Part II: Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) must be feeling stressed these days over the travails of his pal, Sen.
John Ensign (R-Nev.). For those who missed it, Coburn took to the Senate floor last week to decry federal
deficits, which are not, for him, an abstraction.
"It is deeply personal with me," Coburn explained. "I have five grandchildren. I look in their eyes, and I see the
potential of their lives and all of these other children who are out there. You know what? We are going to
waterboard them. That is what we are going to do. We are going to waterboard them. We are going to flood
them with debt. We are going to shackle their opportunities. We are going to limit their possibilities because we
don't have the courage to make the difference for their future."

Washington, DC
October 26, 2009
In the current edition of HBCU Connect, the Department of State placed among the top five employers for Historically Black
Colleges and University (HBCU) students and alumni. The Department of State is the highest-ranking Federal agency, listed
under first-ranked McGraw-Hill, second-ranked Continuum Health Partners, and third-ranked State Farm.
HBCU Connect's ranking of best employers is based on the following criteria: HBCU student and alumni recruitment, brand
penetration in HBCU communities, relationship with HBCU organizations, consistency in outreach efforts, types of positions
made available, and messaging used to reach audience.
It is worth noting that the Department of State ranked:
• first as best federal employer for HBCU students and alumni
• fourth as best employer for HBCU students and alumni

Terrorizing Aid to Somalia
The United States is willfully letting millions of Somalis go hungry in
its drive to hunt down terrorists.
BY NATALIE PARKE I OCTOBER 30, 2009
There is a new humanitarian crisis unfolding in Somalia, and the United States is partly to blame. Despite
sending $2 million and 40 tons of arms and ammunition to the country's Transitional Federal Government
(TFG) earlier this year, now, the United States is withholding humanitarian aid until relief agencies agree to
comply with strict, game-stopping conditions.
The decision to abruptly halt assistance came following suspicions that U.S. aid might be ending up with
Somali "terrorists." The main worry is an al Qaeda-linked group called al-Shabab, the leading Islamic militant
group fighting against the feeble but internationally backed government. Al-Shabab controls most of south-
central Somalia, while the TFG controls only a few areas of the capital, Mogadishu. The south-central region is
home to 2.7 million of the 3.63 million Somalis in need of emergency assistance. So, reaching many of
Somalia's people with aid would likely entail operating on al-Shabab's turf and interacting with elements of the
group to facilitate logistics.
U.S. Treasury Department sanctions strictly prohibit any financial transactions or dealings with al-Shabab and
other Somali groups labeled as "terrorists." Yet clearly the concern is not absolute; the U.S. government seems
less concerned that the guns and ammo sent as military assistance, intended to prop up the fragile government
and keep control of a country brimming with violence, are allegedly being resold on the streets of Mogadishu.
The halt in humanitarian assistance will cripple the work of relief organizations and, as a consequence, hurt
their Somali beneficiaries. U.S. officials justifiably fear that they and their partners could be held responsible,
even prosecuted, for supporting terrorists if relief funds ended up in the hands of al-Shabab. At first, the U.S.
government reviewed the situation and "delayed" funding. Subsequently, Washington issued conditions with
which aid agencies must comply to legally operate in Somalia. But the conditions are so restrictive that it would
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765106 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765106 Date: 07/31/2015
be virtually impossible for operating agencies to meet them. (To preserve the security of those groups on the
ground, specific conditions cannot be stated here.) .
The damage is not just temporary. The new, politically charged rules would destroy relief organizations'
neutrality in Somalia. Humanitarian aid derives its legitimacy from impartiality -- the notion that aid is
provisioned on need alone, rather than politics. In Somalia, where the U.S. government is often viewed
unfavorably, political impartiality is a practical consideration as well; it is central to the ability of relief agencies
to function safely and effectively. The new U.S. conditions would undermine this core principle by making it
nearly impossible for relief agencies to legally operate in al-Shabab-run territory, including many of the most
desperate regions of Somalia. The country is already one of the most dangerous for humanitarian workers, so
the United States' attempt to bring relief workers under its purview will only increase Somali suspicion toward
them and make the environment more precarious.
On top of this policy disaster, money for relief in Somalia is running out. The U.N. World Food Program
estimates that its coffers will be empty within the next few weeks. Even if more funds were pledged today, it
could require as many as four months for the money to reach beneficiaries on the ground. There will be an
inevitable gap in assistance to Somalis.
The timing could not be worse. The country's already catastrophic humanitarian crisis is being compounded by
a drought that has struck much of the Horn of Africa. Nearly half the population is estimated to urgently need
aid -- some 3.63 million people. •
The U.S. government is holding the Somalia relief enterprise and its beneficiaries hostage to its
counterterrorism policy. Agencies have resolutely upheld their commitment to humanitarian impartiality and
refused to be shut down by unreasonable conditions. Unfortunately, that precludes them from accepting U.S.
funds -- normally half of all aid to Somalia. Until Washington lets agencies fulfill their mission unhindered, the
U.S. mission to win "hearts and minds" in Somalia, a feared up-and-coming stronghold of terrorism, will be
completely undermined. Knowingly allowing millions of people to suffer is no way to win friends.

because the US delayed some 40 million pounds of food contributions in Kenyan warehouses "out of fears that
they would be diverted" to the Shabab insurgents by Somali contractors. The US, however, "played down the

U.N. Says U.S. Delays Led to Aid Cuts in Somalia
By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN
Published: November 6, 2009
NAIROBI, Kenya — United Nations officials said Friday that the supply of critical food
aid to Somalia had been interrupted and that rations to starving people needed to be
cut, partly because the American government had delayed food contributions out of
fears that they would be diverted to terrorists.
Last month, American officials said they had suspended millions of dollars of food aid
because of concerns that Somali contractors working for the United Nations were

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765250 Date: 07/31/2015
funneling food and money to the Shabab, an Islamist insurgent group with growing ties
to Al Qaeda.
American officials played down the impact of the delays and said the food shipments
would resume soon, once the United States government was assured that the United
Nations was doing more to police the aid deliveries.
But on Friday, the World Food Program said, "The food supply line to. Somalia is
effectively broken."
United Nations officials said that around 40 million pounds of American-donated food
was being held up in warehouses in Mombasa, in neighboring Kenya, because
American officials were not allowing aid workers to distribute it until a new set of
tighter regulations was ironed out.
United Nations officials said the American government was insisting on guarantees
that were unrealistic in Somalia, like demanding that aid transporters not pay fees at
roadblocks, which are ubiquitous and virtually unavoidable in a nation widely
considered a case study in chaos.
American aid officials declined to comment on Friday.
In the drought-stricken regions of central Somalia, where entire communities are on
the brink of famine, elders said that many children who had been surviving off the
American donations were now dying from hunger.
"We are totally dependent on this food, and people are now suffering," said Ahmed
Mahamoud Hassan, the chairman of the drought committee in Galcaio, central
Somalia. "We have nothing else to eat."
Somalia is one of the neediest nations in the world — and one of the most complex
environments to deliver aid. Ever since the central government imploded in 1991, the
country has lurched from one crisis to the next, the latest being a vicious civil war
between a weak government and an extremist Islamist insurgency during one of the
worst droughts in years.
The United States has played a huge role in saving lives by supplying about 40 percent
of the $850 million annual aid budget for Somalia. But that aid is often only loosely
monitored at best once it enters the country because of the dangers of working in
Somalia and the fact that so much of it is a no-go zone for foreigners.

For months now, United Nations officials have been negotiating with their American
counterparts, trying to agree on language for new rules that would ensure, as much as
possible, that American donated food goes to needy people and not to the Shabab.
Last month, American officials said they were legally bound to do this, because the
American government has listed the Shabab as a terrorist organization, a designation
that means that aiding or abetting the Shabab is a serious crime.
There is increasing evidence, according to United Nations documents, that some of the
United Nations contractors in Somalia have been stealing food and channeling the
proceeds to the Shabab and other militant groups. United Nations officials are
investigating some of their biggest contractors.
United Nations officials say that other donor nations have been skittish about
contributing aid during these investigations, which is another reason for the aid
shortages in Somalia. The global recession has also taken a toll on aid operations
around the world.
That said, "the United States is traditionally W.F.P.'s largest single donor," said Peter
Smerdon, a spokesman for the World Food Program, "and other donors cannot make
up the difference."
He warned that the food supplies for Somalia were steadily dwindling each month and
that by December, "we will completely run out."
Partly because of the standoff over the new rules and the ensuing interruption in the
food pipeline, the World Food Program recently halved the emergency rations to the
more than one million displaced Somalis.
United Nations officials said they had been urging the American government to release
at least some of the food from the warehouses in Kenya while they worked out the new
rules.
The officials said that even if they wanted to bypass the American government and ship
in food from other countries, which would cost millions of dollars, it would be
impossible to get it to Somalia in time and that the American sacks of grain sitting in
Mombasa were the only solution to averting a widespread famine.
"The urgency of the situation has been communicated," said one United Nations official
in Nairobi, who spoke on condition of anonymity because negotiations were
continuing. "Basically, USAID," the United States Agency for International
Development, "has to come through, one way or the other."

Why the Greg Craig debacle matters
By: Elizabeth Drew
November 19, 2009 11:58 AM EST
President Barack Obama is returning from his trek to Asia Thursday to a capital that is a
considerably more dangerous place for him than when he departed.
While he was abroad, there was a palpable sense at home of something gone wrong. A
critical mass of influential people who once held big hopes for his presidency began to
wonder whether they had misjudged the man. Most significant, these doubters now find
themselves with a new reluctance to defend Obama at a phase of his presidency when he
needs defenders more urgently than ever.
This is the price Obama has paid with his complicity and most likely his active
participation, in the shabbiest episode of his presidency: The firing by leaks of White
House counsel Gregory Craig, a well-respected Washington veteran and influential early
supporter of Obama.
The people who are most aghast by the handling of the Craig departure can't be
dismissed by the White House as Republican partisans, or still-embittered Hillary Clinton
supporters. They are not naïve activists who don't understand that the exercise of power
can be a rough business and that trade-offs and personal disappointments are inevitable.
Instead, they are people, either in politics or close observers, who once held an
unromantically high opinion of Obama. They were important to his rise, and are likely
more important to the success or failure of his presidency than Obama or his distressingly
insular and small-minded West Wing team appreciate.
The Craig embarrassment gives these people a new reason — not the first or only reason
— to conclude that he wasn't the person of integrity and even classiness they had thought,
and, more fundamentally, that his ability to move people and actually lead a fractured and
troubled country (the reason many preferred him over Hillary Clinton) is not what had been
promised in the campaign.

This may seem like a lot to hang on a Washington personnel move. After all, intramural
back-stabbing or making people fall guys when things go wrong (think Bill Clinton's
Defense Secretary Les Aspin after the disaster in Somalia) are not new to
Washingtonians.
But Craig's ouster did not occur in a vacuum. It served as a focal point to concerns that
have been building for months that Obama wasn't pressing for all that might be possible
within the existing political constraints (all that one could ask of a president); that his
presidential voice hadn't fulfilled the hopes raised by his campaign voice (which had also
taken him a while to find); that he hadn't created a movement, as he had raised
expectations that he would; that would be there to back him up and help him fulfill his
promises.
That is why it is worth pondering how the Craig story, unfolded in detail — its
consequences likely will echo far longer than anything Obama said or did in Asia.
Briefly, here's what happened, some of it told for the first time: Craig, who had known the
Clintons since they were all at Yale Law School together, had served as a senior adviser
to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, but in 1998 gave up that job to help defend Bill
Clinton against impeachment. Yet in 2008, he supported Obama for the nomination — not
so much a turning against Hillary Clinton as being impressed early, as were some other
prominent Washingtonians, by the then-state senator but would-be U.S. Senate candidate
at a fundraiser held by Vernon Jordan, seeing Obama as the first potentially inspiring
Democratic figure since Robert Kennedy. In the course of the campaign, Craig wrote a
highly publicized memo questioning some of Hillary Clinton's claims of foreign policy
experience, such as coming under enemy fire in Tuzla, Bosnia. During the campaign,
Craig coached Obama for the debates (playing McCain), and praised him highly. Craig's
imprimatur helped the neophyte Obama in certain influential circles.
He hoped to get a high foreign policy position in an Obama administration, but when
Clinton was named secretary of state, this of course became untenable. The Clintons are
an unforgiving lot. So, Obama and Craig agreed that Craig would take the job of White
House counsel for a year, and then they'd discuss what he'd do next. Thus, Craig was
handed a very tricky portfolio.
During the transition, about mid-December, Craig presented to a group of the president's
newly named national security advisers meeting in Washington — including Clinton,
Defense Secretary Robert Gates, national security adviser General James Jones, and
others — three proposed executive orders: One ordered the shutting down of Guantanamo
in a year. (The others banned torture and closed down the C.I.A.'s "black sites"; and
addressed future detainee policy.) The one-year target for closing Guantanamo resulted
from consultations with human rights and detainee rights groups, who argued that
Guantanamo could be shut down in three months, and with Pentagon officials, who had
no united position but argued that it would take from a year to 18 months.
At the meeting, only the newly named Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano,
beamed in from Arizona, questioned whether a year was realistic. When Gates, as he
later confirmed publicly, said that though it was an "ambitious" deadline, he supported it
because setting it was the only way to get things, especially the bureaucracy, moving
toward that end, and that it could be extended if it couldn't be met, that was it.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765589 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765589 Date: 07/31/2015
Obama's new national security team signed off on the executive order to close
Guantanamo in a year. This was passed along to the president as well as his top aides;
Craig was never in a meeting with the political side of the White House on the
Guantanamo matter — and the president-elect and then president raised no objection
before, when, or after he signed off on it.
Unsurprisingly, the deadline became hard to meet, for various legal and political reasons -
including the congressional outburst of NIMBYISM (similar to its earlier outbursts on Dubai
Ports and even Terri Schiavo — short-term, irrational, and politically motivated fits that
erupt from the Congress from time to time). If Craig failed to foresee this (as some later
charged), he had a lot of company.
The closing of Guantanamo is undoubtedly far further along than it would have been
without the executive order. But along the way, Craig fell out of favor with the president's
political aides and, apparently, the president himself. Whether he was simply being made
the fall guy, or the tight circle of Chicagoans in the White House didn't care for this
outsider, or he committed some unknown errors, suddenly, in August, leaks began to
surface that his job was in danger. Non-denial denials were issued from the White House.
The leaks became a pattern, a systematic, anonymous, tipping off of reporters that Craig
would soon be gone.
Craig was accused, anonymously of course, of a welter of charges: of being "too close to
the human rights groups" (if so, what was wrong with that?), of not playing well with
others, of being a bad manager, of being fixated on Guantanamo to the detriment of other
issues. In the summer, Obama offered Craig another job, which Craig declined, and the
two agreed that they would discuss the matter further later in the year. But the leaks
continued, and Craig decided that his situation was untenable, and he had to leave.
To make sure he did, he was leaked his way out, up to the day before he planned to
resign. What caused so many Obama supporters' stomachs to turn was that Obama could
have stopped the leaking at any time; he or White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel
could have arranged a dignified departure. (They're within their rights to get rid of
someone if they're dissatisfied, for good reasons or not — but a preferred route would be to
call that person in and ask what day would suit him or her to resign, and then just let that
person do it. This happens a lot in administrations; even if people don't believe the
resignation was voluntary, there's a soupcon of dignity left to that person.) Even some
Hillary Clinton supporters, who still hold no brief for Craig, think he was treated shabbily.
And this opinion is not confined to "political junkies." Thomas Wilner, a distinguished
Washington attorney who challenged Bush administration detainee policies, particularly on
Guantanamo, and had worked with Craig on these issues, told me, "There's a lot of
concern among a lot of lawyers in this town, especially those who were supporting
Obama, that somebody this bright, this respected, this good, and with this integrity, was
treated in such a way."
Yes, we knew, or should have, during the campaign that the supposed idealist Obama
had a bit of the Chicago cut-throat in him, but there was little sign that he could be as
brutal and heedless of loyalty as he was in the Craig affair. An unexpected climate of fear
emanates from the Obama White House.
The incident underscored worries that several had held about the Obama White House for
some time: that it was too tightly controlled and narrowly focused by the Chicago crowd;
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765589 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765589 Date: 07/31/2015
that it seemed from the outset to need an older, wiser head, someone with a bit more
detachment.
The current crowd displays a certain impulsiveness and vindictiveness that do it no good -
as in the silly war-let on Fox News that it is now trying to back out of. Even if Craig was
making a hash of his job — and there's no independent evidence of this — it just wasn't
smart to treat someone widely held in such high respect in this manner; once again, the
impulsiveness backfired.
The replacing of Craig with Washington attorney Robert Bauer, Obama's own attorney for
years as well as counsel for the Democratic National Committee and the Obama
campaign, further narrowed the White House circle just when it needed broadening,
lowered the stature of the office, and choosing the president's personal attorney for a
position that calls for dispassionate judgment is hazardous. (Does anyone remember
Alberto Gonzalez?)
The Obama's themselves hang tight with a small Chicago crowd. Yes, he talks to others,
and yes, a president's time is very limited, but the Obama's themselves seem as closed-
off and unto themselves as does his inner White House circle. (Is this a coincidence?
What is all this wariness about?) When the Obama's go to someone's house for dinner,
almost invariably it's to that of Valerie Jarrett, the old friend from Chicago who serves as a
counselor and whom they see all day. Old Chicago friends fly in for weekends frequently.
Old friends, who had helped launch him, helped them personally, have been left behind.
At the same time as the Craig imbroglio happened, many people who had defended
Obama against charges that he wasn't what he'd been cracked up to be were now
becoming concerned themselves: though it was a relief to have a president who thought
through crucial decisions about sending the country's young to war, it was taking him
awfully long to make up his mind about what to do about Afghanistan and Pakistan, and
the decision-making was bafflingly leak-ridden (was this a deliberate airing of ideas or a
loss of control over the process?); that the health care debate had in fact careened out of
his control and it seemed less and less likely that, having used up almost a year of his
presidency on it (his "deadlines" had become irrelevant, and so, in a way, had he), he
would end up with a bill, if at all, that did enough net good.
Certain things are not his fault: the unprecedented truculence of the Republican Party,
scared silly by right-wing ranters on cable television; the unholy economic and foreign-
policy mess that he inherited; the fact that he never had, as so many liberal commentators
asserted, the 60 (or 58 or 59) Senate votes that would enable him to get what he wanted
from the Congress. It's not his fault that unemployment rates remain stubbornly high
following a traumatic recession.
And it's always risky to project the long-term from the moment. Perhaps this will prove to
have been a passing moment. Perhaps Obama will still salvage a health care bill that is a
real step forward (though there will be a humongous fight over its definition); maybe he'll
come up with a smart strategy — or the best of bad options — on Afghanistan and Pakistan;
it's not impossible that he'll add real progress on climate change and regulatory reform to
his list of achievements, and that he'll start to get the deficit under control.
Maybe there'll be enough examples of grace that will make people forget this period of
pettiness. He's been lucky before; maybe he'll get lucky again. Meanwhile, serious people
who had a lot of hope about him and who defended him are more worried than ever, and

in this if anything over-communicative society the White House can't write them off as "a
bunch of Washington insiders." So meanwhile, there's a palpable mood change in
Washington that could signify that Barack Obama is in deeper trouble than he was even a
week ago.

"He had little record but lots of rhetoric -- much of it morally stirring and beautifully written," Richard Cohen writes in his
Washington Post column. "As president, though, he has tried so hard to be the un-George Bush that the former
president's overweening moralism -- his insistence on seeing things as either black or white -- has become an Obama
gray. Human rights in general has been treated as if it's a Republican idea. Obama should reread his Philadelphia speech.
He'll find a good man there."

USGLC Applauds Choice of Dr. Rajiv Shah as USAID Administrator
In Choosing Dr. Shah, President Signals Important Role Development Plays in Foreign Policy
Washington, DC — The U.S. Global Leadership Coalition released the following statement from Executive Director Liz
Schrayer on President Obama's announcement of Dr. Rajiv Shah to be Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International
Development:
`The USGLC applauds the President's nomination of Dr. Rajiv Shah to be USAID Administrator as yet another example of
the President's commitment to elevating our civilian-led, smart power tools. With a robust International Affairs Budget
request for FY 2010, a pledge to double foreign assistance by 2015, a Presidential Study Directive on Global Development
and the State Department's Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, the Administration continues to demonstrate
the essential role development and diplomacy play in our foreign policy.
"Rajiv Shah is a fresh and dynamic addition to President Obama's foreign policy team. Dr. Shah will bring expertise and
energy to a critical agency in need of strong, empowered leadership. His career in global development, global health and
agricultural development give him real perspective to lead USAID. He is already an important player in the Administration's
food security initiative, and his additional background in fighting global poverty and promoting global health make him an
ideal candidate for this important post.
"The USGLC's broad, bipartisan coalition welcomes Dr. Shah's nomination to be USAID Administrator, and we look forward
to working with him to strengthen the role of development"

Subject: FW: Letter from Senator Baucus
Nora: I'm responding on Tom's behalf. We've drafted up a letter in response, and I believe it's with H right now.
We've had a near-constant dialogue with Baucus' office on this, and I'm afraid we haven't been able to, and aren't likely in
the near future, to satisfy them.
1) Development and environmental protection on the Flathead River is a long-running source of tension between Montana
and British Columbia. To protect the Flathead Basin, Sen. Baucus has long championed restrictions against development
on both sides of the border.
2) Over the years, the USG has worked closely with the Canadian federal government to ensure several Canadian
mining proposals were fully assessed for environmental impact. To date, the British Columbia provincial government has
not approved any mining proposals in the Flathead Basin—and there are no additional proposals on the horizon.
3) The Senator would like to see B.C. and Canada move toward a more permanent way to protect the region, rather than
having to battle each new mining proposal. For example, environmental NGOs advocate the Canadians establishing a
national park or other development moratorium.
4) While we certainly agree with that approach in principal, the problem is that under Canada's system, provincial
governments hold the authority over natural resource management. Therefore, even though the Canadian park
service likewise would favor a national park in the northern Flathead Basin, nothing can happen without the agreement of
the Province of British Columbia.
5) British Columbia has informed us that they see no need for broader, more permanent protections in the Flathead Basin,
and believe their environmental assessment process gives adequate protection against development-related threats.
6) Because of the federal-provincial dynamic in Canada, the Canadian federal government can't really compel British
Columbia to establish permanent protections in the Flathead Basin.
7) Glacier National Park and the Canadian Waterton Lakes National Park are U.N. World Heritage Sites. The U.N. World
Heritage committee recently sent a mission to the Flathead basin, to assess potential threats to the two national
parks. Their report is expected this month or next. The release of the report will provide us an opportunity to engage B.C.
and Canada again on the future of the Flathead region.

So, we will use the release of the UN report to re-engage with both Canada and B.C. If we're lucky, perhaps the UN will
recommend the broader "Baucus" approach, and we might find we have more luck armed with that—but that's not at all
clear. In the meantime, we continue to reassure Baucus and staff that there is no/no planned development currently for
the area about which he's concerned.
I hope that helps, and sorry for slightly long-winded explanation. The draft response to Baucus is on the high side, and
please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns. Many thanks, Roberta

Colleagues —
I have attached a Reuters report below about a U.S. national who has been arrested in Northern Afghanistan over a
shooting incident.
Ops spoke with Kabul ACS Chief Katie Nutt who said that this incident occurred on November 8. Kabul has kept CA/OCS
in the loop about the case. The man, who works for a NGO, has not yet been charged and is being held at a NDS
(National Directorate of Security) site in a private cell. He is being treated well and has hired an attorney from the
Consular Section's list. The Consular Section has kept in touch with him, and the Swedish-led PRT in Mazar-i-Sharif has
also been in contact.

U.S. aid worker held over Afghan boy's shooting
KABUL, Nov 11 (Reuters) - An American aid worker in northern Afghanistan is being held by Afghan authorities over the
fatal shooting of an Afghan teenager at his home, a provincial police chief said on Wednesday.
Mohammad Bilal Niram, chief of police in the northern Sar-i-pul province, said the aid worker had killed his landlord's
16-year-old son with three gunshots, possibly suspecting a burglary when the boy tried to enter his home.
"He is in Afghan government custody for investigation. He has not been charged," Niram said.
The man worked for GP he said, referring to Global Partners, a UK-based aid group which says it has run programmes in
Afghanistan since 1993. Staff at the organisation's London headquarters declined to comment on the incident.
John Groch, a spokesman for the U.S. embassy, confirmed that an American had been arrested in Sar-i-pul but said he
could give no further details pending the Afghan police investigation.

I want to thank all three of you for the tremendous support you have given me and WHA since the beginning of the
Obama Administration. I am especially grateful to the Secretary for the confidence she has shown in me, and her
willingness to make me part of her team. I consider this an enormous honor and I hope that I have met her
expectations. I look forward to continuing to be part of her team from Brazil.
I am preparing a "Last Thoughts" paper for the Secretary, which will look back over the past ten months, identify
accomplishments, and point toward what I think needs to come next. I will share this paper with Arturo.
Regarding Honduras, Craig did heroic work there this week, and we are moving toward a potentially big step by
Micheletti that would open space for many of our allies to support the elections. As we move forward, it is important to
note that the solution to the crisis is becoming more and more Honduran with each step in the process. This is a good
thing, because it increases the chances that the resolution will be peaceful, enduring, and a platform for the political
reforms that must come next.
It is worth highlighting that the Secretary, through her outreach to both sides and her clear commitment to the future of
Honduran democracy, has positioned us as an honest broker in this dispute. The only honest broker. Everyone one else
in this drama -- from Insulza to the Brazilians to the Albinos -- has other agendas and motives in play. In this regard, we
are the only hope of the Honduran people. The internal dialogue taking place, within the de facto regime, among its
supporters, and between the Micheletti and Zelaya camps, is the product of our engagement. No one else could have
done this. I urge that you keep this in mind as we move forward and as we consider how we will support the November
29 elections.
Finally, I leave behind a great Bureau. I believe it is the best in the State Department. Craig and the other DASes are
superb, and I believe we have an extraordinary cadre of Ambassadors. This is a huge resource for the Secretary and the
President. Use it.
Again, my deepest thanks to you and the Secretary.

I appreciate being included in the dialogue last evening. I now have a much better appreciation for the challenges, as
well as the pressures you and the Secretary address each day. While I suspect there is not much that those of us on the
"outside" can do to help, call on me at any time if I can assist in any fashion. Not to be too dramatic about it but the
Secretary's success is in the country's interests. Reference was made last night to more rest for HRC-I have to believe
that with the rigors of your job a little R+R for you is in order-hopefully you can work out some personal time over the
holiday period.
By the way, can you give me an email for Capricia Marshall?
All the best and do call if there is anything I can do.

About six weeks ago, HRC agreed to give a speech commemorating the anniversary of the 1994 UN Conference on
Population and Development in Cairo. I believe the actual anniversary is December 18th so frankly, if we did the speech
in early January, we would not be that far off the mark. The idea would be to do this speech at State with the audience
including the NGOs, Gates Foundation, UN, and Packard Foundations. This speech could send a message regarding the
link between population and environmental sustainability and as a result, improve women's status and rights. I would
love to give them January 6th_8th if that works on your end.

To: Mills, Cheryl D
Subject: Re: FW: Uganda Death Penalty for Homosexual Activity Pending Law
"When my son told me he was gay, I told him, 'Now, I love you more.' I want to tell the world that hatred is not
born with human beings, it is a seed that is planted by adults and is fostered creating a climate of intolerance
and violence. We must change our ways and understand that anyone ...could have been my son. And I want
everybody to know that Jorge Steven was a very much loved son." -Miriam Mercado's statement
Background: Stephen Mercado was found decapitated, dismembered, and burned by the side of the road in
PR. The police investigator reportedly suggested that he got what he deserved for living "that type of lifestyle."
Here's an AP article after the suspect was arrested:
Murder charge filed in Puerto Rico teen slaying
By MIKE MELIA (AP) – 6 days ago
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Murder charges were filed Wednesday in the slaying of a gay teenager whose
decapitated, partially burned body was found last week, while U.S. authorities said they were still considering
whether to make it a hate crime case.
Gay activists expressed disappointment that the suspect wasn't immediately charged with a hate crime, saying
authorities in Puerto Rico have never invoked a law covering crimes based on sexual orientation.
The dismembered body of 19-year-old college student Jorge Steven Lopez Mercado was discovered Friday
along a road in the interior town of Cayey. Lopez was widely known as a volunteer for organizations
advocating HIV prevention and gay rights, and activists are planning remembrance vigils for him in cities
including San Juan, New York and Chicago.
The suspect, 26-year-old Juan Martinez Matos, was arrested earlier this week and allegedly confessed to killing
Lopez and mutilating his body. He was charged with first-degree murder and weapons violations and jailed on
$4 million bond.
An attorney for Martinez could not immediately be reached for comment.
Martinez met Lopez while looking for women Thursday night in an area known for prostitution, according to
prosecutor Jose Bermudez Santos. Bermudez said the suspect confessed to stabbing Lopez, who was dressed as
a woman, after discovering he was a man.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765871 Date: 07/31/2015
"He has a deep-seated rage," Bermudez said in remarks reported by the newspaper El Nuevo Dia.
"All the information we have is very clear that this is indeed a hate crime," said Pedro Julio Serrano, a Puerto
Rico native who is a spokesman for the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.
A 2002 hate crime law in this U.S. territory has not been applied to any cases involving sexual orientation or
gender identity despite calls to use it more aggressively, Serrano said. A suspect convicted of a hate crime
offense as part of another crime automatically faces the maximum penalty for the underlying crime. For murder,
that would be life in prison.
Serrano said he has identified at least 10 slayings on the island over the last seven years that should have been
investigated as hate crimes, including some in which the victims were sex workers.
Two U.S. Congress members from New York, who are of Puerto Rican origin, have suggested prosecuting the
case under new federal hate crimes legislation that extended coverage to sexual orientation. President Barack
Obama signed it last month.
The FBI is monitoring the investigation, and Lymarie Llovet Ayala, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's
office in San Juan, said Wednesday that federal prosecutors are considering whether to take on the case.
Puerto Rico has some history of violence against gays. In the 1980s, the island was terrorized by serial killer
Angel Colon Maldonado, known as "The Angel of the Bachelors," who was linked to the murders of 27
homosexual people and is serving life in prison.
But the island also is known as a welcoming place for gays, particularly in comparison with more socially
conservative Caribbean islands where homosexuals often live in hiding.
"The people of Puerto Rico are very inclusive and accepting of differences," said Serrano. "I think these kinds
of crimes show the ugly side of homophobia, but it's a minority of people that are willing to be so violent in
expressing their prejudice,"

It'f,1the Coratztion, Stupid
Rep. Jane Harman
In rnr..
.ent weeks, prominent American politicians and columnists have begun debating troop levels in
Afghanistan. Some call for a complete withdrawal, while others favor increasing the number of U.S. troops.
The size of U.S. forces in Afghanistan is a critical issue, but a debate about troop strength misses the point.
Unless and until one other problem is addressed, neither more troops nor fewer troops will reverse the tide of
terrorism being fomented in Afghanistan or improve our national security.
It I he corruption, sturici.
Eliminating corruption in Afghanistan is in both that nation's interest and ours. From the Afghan perspective, an
honest government would give the people a genuine say in the direction of their country. For us, it would
dramatically increase our national security, both because it would increase the effectiveness of our efforts to
fight the Taiiban and because the end result would be an Afghan population more invested in taking on the fight
themselves. That is our real objective.
Wrion I traveled tc P..tgrianistan in April with Sen. Jon Kyl, Arizona Republican, we were warned by opposition
candidates that the country's presidential election would be marred by widespread fraud. They were right. On
top of everything else that we have learned about the Afghan government, the vote that took place on Aug. 20
was a sham. Every indication. is that the election results have been completely skewed by widespread,
sys..fematic
Afghan politics have never been particularly clean -- money, power and position traditionally have been traded
for support. from tribal and ethnic blocs. But evidence of fraud in last month's election is colossally disturbing:
Voter cards were bought and sold freely in the run-up to the vote, precinct workers arrived at dawn to find
baiht boxes stuffed fill], some dastricts recorded more votes than there were registered voters, and nationwide
voter registrt*c.:,:il. sumassed the number of eligible voters. by as much as 5 million. The Electoral Complaints

Commission, appointed by President Hamid Karzai, has received more than 2,000 reports of violations,
hundreds of which would have the potential to alter the election's outcome if proved true.
But electoral fraud is merely a symptom of a much graver problem plaguing the country -- the failure to
establish good governance. Pervasive corruption infects all levels of the Afghan government. Tribal elders in
Kandahar told us they were so fed up with the Karzai government that they would join the Taliban if better
governance could not be achieved.
This election is a chilling reminder of what's at stake. Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal appears to understand this.
His emphasis on joint civilian-military efforts to improve governance is much needed, but the American people
deserve some accountability. Congress should not even be asked about more troops without first being shown
evidence that some anti-corruption metrics have been achieved, not just announced.
The U.S. military's mission will be undermined so long as the Afghan government fails to govern. That's what's
happening right now.
A recent poll found 83 percent of Afghans think their country needs to change direction. Lowering that
disapproval number should be a key ingredient in any measure of governance; public opinion is essential in
judging whether the government .ass earned the people's trust. That's what a successful counterinsurgency effort
is really about: giving Afghans faith in their institutions and developing a willingness to cooperate with and
protect them. Public opinion should be gauged on a province-by-province basis to help assess where
government is sneceeding and w!nere it is not.
But change mast start at the top. If the sham election stands and Mr. Karzai remains president, he must
drastically ehange his personal poiiLics. He has preserved his position of power through a series of politically
expedient bur. morally repugnant alliances. This includes turning a blind eye to Helmand province, where his
brother, A:hiller' Vv al Karzai, has became a legendary and detested figure. The Karzais deny Ahmed Wali's
involvement in the heroin trade -- Helmand is the world's primary producer -- but don't quarrel that he is in the
"transportation, 'ausimms."
Hamid Karzai also cut a deal that reimposed Shariah law on Afghanistan's Shi'ite population, which returned
women the; -teadiiionai role nranerty, with girls sold as brides and women legally required to "submit" to
their husbaaCts' !nnotal needs.

Greetings and congratulations on the Secretary's successes in bringing about a responsible and sane foreign policy
during her short tenure at State.
Senator Menendez asked that I bring the following matter to your attention. This past February
- an
ambassadorial level appointment.
There has been considerable confusion
around role and responsibilities The bottom line is that
led to believe the appointment would come with more responsibilities than the ones associated with the two-week
meetings. She is anxious to serve in a larger capacity than present. The Senator is hopeful the commitments made to
can be fulfilled, even if she were to be given a different portfolio.
I understand either you or your staff will meet with in the near future. In advance, we thank you for
whatever you can do to find a solution to the current situation. Please feel free to email me or call me at
should you want to discuss this matter further.
Good luck in all your endeavors.

Hitting Bottom in Foggy Bottom
The State Department suffers from low morale, bottlenecks, and bureaucratic ineptitude. Do we need to kill it to save it?
BY MATTHEW ARMSTRONG I SEPTEMBER 11, 2009
Discussion over the fate of Foggy Bottom usually focuses on the tenure of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the troubles
of public diplomacy, and the rise of special envoys on everything from European pipelines to Afghanistan and Pakistan.
But Americans would benefit more from a reassessment of the core functionality of the U.S. State Department.
Years of neglect and marginalization, as well as a dearth of long-term vision and strategic planning, have left the 19th-
century institution hamstrung with fiefdoms and bureaucratic bottlenecks. The Pentagon now funds and controls a wide
range of foreign-policy and diplomatic priorities -- from development to public diplomacy and beyond. The world has
changed, with everyone from politicians to talking heads to terrorists directly influencing global audiences. The most
pressing issues are stateless: pandemics, recession, terrorism, poverty, proliferation, and conflict. But as report after
report, investigation after investigation, has highlighted, the State Department is broken and paralyzed, unable to
respond to the new 21st-century paradigm.
But how did it get so bad? Is it possible to fix? Or should we just push it over the wall like a great Humpty Dumpty and
reassign the pieces?
There is growing evidence that the internal machinations of the State Department have corrupted its "core missions" of
traditional diplomacy and public diplomacy. This year, for example, the Government Accountability Office (gao) found
that the department completely failed in its now four-year-old attempt to reorganize its nonproliferation bureau (a
bureau that remains leaderless). Besides failing to address mission overlap, low morale, and lack of career opportunities,
the failed reorganization caused a significant drop in expertise in offices focused on proliferation issues -- including
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765924 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765924 Date: 07/31/2015
"today's threats posted by Iran, North Korea, and Syria," the gao's report said -- and coordination with bodies like the
International Atomic Energy Agency.
Another report by the State Department's inspector general this year described severe and broad dysfunction within the
Africa bureau, while ignoring -- perhaps considering it a given -- the lack of departmentwide integration and leadership
in operations. Examples of the dysfunction range from not providing public diplomacy personnel with computers
capable of reading interoffice memos to a failure to effectively work with the new Africa Command.
By necessity, the Defense Department has stepped in where State Department has tuned out: Foggy Bottom relies on
Pentagon funding and even personnel for basic operations central to its mission. For example, the Defense Department
now performs much strategic communications work traditionally the purview of the State Department. In Somalia, for
example, the State Department's budget for public diplomacy is $30,000. The Pentagon's is $600,000. And, in the State
Department's bureaucratic wisdom, the $30,000 does not even belong to its undersecretary for public diplomacy and
public affairs.
Further, rivalries between the different "cones" -- or career tracks, referred to by one insider as the "conal caste system"
-- at the State Department severely impact morale, career growth, and even operations. The report on the Africa bureau
noted that in 2002, public affairs and public diplomacy was a "failed office" -- and that the situation is worse in 2009.
Public outreach workers said the bureau's leadership "does not understand public diplomacy." The sentiment is
widespread. A 2008 report by a congressional ombudsman, the U.S. Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy,
described a systemic failure to support and train public diplomacy officers in the field, as well as professional
discrimination against those in the career track.
Attempts to fix the State Department have focused on short-term issues, such as ameliorating its shortages in human
and financial resources. The last eight secretaries of state have attempted to bolster the department by bolstering its
bottom line. No less than Defense Secretary Robert Gates and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike
Mullen, have long suggested transferring funds from the Defense Department to State Department. But the situation is
so dire that the State Department, at this point, could not even absorb and spend that much-needed infusion of cash. If
there were a wholesale transfer of funds tomorrow, the lack of capacity and skills at the State department would mean
it would have to give it back to the Defenk Department or dole it out to contractors.
The creeping militarization of U.S. foreign policy is itself deeply worrying, not just to Gates and Mullen, but also to such
luminaries as Secretary Clinton and Vice President Joe Biden. In 2008, then-Senator Biden questioned the "expanding
role of the military in U.S. foreign policy." He said he was concerned by the "migration of functions and authorities from
U.S. civilian agencies to the Department of Defense."
Some commentators have even wondered aloud whether the best way to fix the State Department might be to destroy
it. Foggy Bottom could retain a small core staff for its embassies and ambassadors. All other functions -- such as public
diplomacy, countering misinformation and propaganda, and development, including provincial reconstruction staffing --
could migrate to the Pentagon or become wholly independent agencies.
But atomizing the State Department would ultimately prove dangerous and further the militarization of foreign policy.
The Pentagon needs a counterbalance, a vertically integrated State Department that the president, Congress, and the
U.S. public can count on. Change, rather than creative destruction, is what Foggy Bottom needs.
Envision a State Department capable of leading whole-of-government initiatives with a strategic focus instead of one
hidebound department geared by structure and tradition to execute state-to-state diplomacy. This "Department of State
and Non-State" would be as deft at tackling stateless terrorist networks and hurricanes as it would be at fostering and
upholding alliances with foreign ministers. To transform Foggy Bottom in this way will require breaking the rigid
hierarchy, stovepipes, and bottlenecks which make the Pentagon look lean and dynamic in comparison.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765924 Date: 07/31/2015
Modern global affairs are not compartmentalized by political borders. Besides expanding the overly shallow and narrow
authorities of the public diplomacy bureau, Clinton must restructure the State Department to focus less on countries
and more on regions. Currently, each of Foggy Bottom's regional bureaus, such as Near East Affairs, is configured to
oversee its patch of embassies. Country desk officers, and most ambassadors, report to an assistant secretary, the
regional head. The assistant secretary in turn reports to an undersecretary, who reports to Clinton.
Clinton should name the regional bureau heads, currently assistant secretaries, to undersecretary status. This would
help eliminate an unnecessary bureaucratic layer and would also align the State Department with the Defense
Department (which has powerful regional commands, such as Centcom and Africom). The State Department's regional
leaders would hold an equivalent civilian rank to four-star combatant commanders like Gen. David Petraeus. These
changes would promise to improve communications, synchronize missions, and put the department on the right path for
today's requirements.
But Clinton should beware reforming the State Department too quickly from within -- her efforts could be paralyzed by a
bureaucracy in mutiny that would simply wait her out. U.S. national security would suffer and the Pentagon's growing
power would become more entrenched. Clinton will need the clear and unequivocal support of the president and more
importantly Congress, which authorizes State Department spending bills, to have a chance at success.
In a burst of activity after Barack Obama's election, Congress authorized more money and people for the
State Department and pushed for greater public diplomacy. Still more is required. The question asked over the last eight
years as the State Department abrogated its various responsibilities -- if not Defense, then who? -- will not, indeed
cannot, be answered until the department steps up to the plate and becomes effective and visible in leading and
implementing U.S. foreign policy. This will take time. But, as the saying goes, there is no time like the present. The
United States now has a Congress that supports change, secretaries of state and defense who want change, a president
whose entire election platform was built around the word "change," and an American public that would be outraged at
the dysfunction if it only knew the details.

Black in the Age of Obama
By CHARLES M. BLOW
A hundred and fifty years ago, Charles Dickens opened "A Tale of Two Cities" with the now-famous phrase:
"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. ..."
Those words resonated with me recently while contemplating the impact of the Obama presidency on blacks in
America. So far, it's been mixed. Blacks are living a tale of two Americas — one of the ascension of the first
black president with the cultural capital that accrues; the other of a collapsing quality of life and amplified racial
tensions, while supporting a president who is loath to even acknowledge their pain, let alone commiserate in it.
Last year, blacks dared to dream anew, envisioning a future in which Obama's election would be the catalyst for
an era of prosperity and more racial harmony. Now that the election's afterglow has nearly faded, the hysteria of
hope is being ground against the hard stone of reality. Things have not gotten better. In many ways, they've
gotten worse.
The recession, for one, has dealt a particularly punishing and uneven hand to blacks.
A May report from the Pew Research Center found that blacks were the most likely to get higher-priced
subprime loans, leading to higher foreclosure rates. In fact, blacks have displaced Hispanics as the group with
the lowest homeownership rates.
According to the most recent jobs data, not only is the unemployment rate for blacks nearly twice that of whites,
the gap in some important demographics has widened rapidly since Obama took office. The unemployment rate
over that time for white college graduates under 24 years old grew by about 20 percent. For their black cohorts,
the rate grew by about twice that much.
And a report published last month by the Department of Agriculture found that in 2008, "food insecurity" for
American households had risen to record levels, with black children being the most likely to experience that
food insecurity.
Things on the racial front are just as bad.

We are now inundated with examples of overt racism on a scale to which we are unaccustomed. Any protester
with a racist poster can hijack a news cycle, while a racist image can live forever on the Internet. In fact, racially
offensive images of the first couple are so prolific online that Google now runs an apologetic ad with the results
of image searches of them.
And it's not all words and images; it's actions as well. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's 2008
hate crimes data released last week, anti-black hate crimes rose 4 percent from 2007, while the combined hate
crimes against all other racial categories declined 11 percent. If you look at the two-year trend, which would
include Obarna's ascension as a candidate, anti-black hate crimes have risen 8 percent, while those against the
other racial groups have fallen 19 percent.
This has had a sobering effect on blacks. According to a Nov. 9 report from Gallup, last summer 23 percent of
blacks thought that race relations would get a lot better with the election of Obama. Now less than half that
percentage says that things have actually gotten a lot better.
The racial animosity that Obama's election has stirred up may have contributed to a rallying effect among
blacks. According to a Gallup report published on Nov. 24, Obama's approval rating among whites has dropped
to 39 percent, but among blacks it remains above 90 percent.
Also, this hasn't exactly been a good year for black men in the news. Plaxico Burress was locked up for
accidentally shooting off a gun in a club. Henry Louis Gates Jr. was locked up for intentionally shooting off his
mouth at his own home. And Michael Jackson died after being shot full of propofol. Chris Brown brutally beat
Rihanna. Former Representative William Jefferson was convicted. And most recently, the "personal failings" of
Tiger Woods portray him as an alley cat. Meanwhile, the most critically acclaimed black movie of the year,
"Precious," features a black man who rapes and twice impregnates his own daughter. Rooting for the president
feels like a nice counterbalance.
However, the rallying creates a conundrum for blacks: how to air anxiety without further arming Obama's
enemies. This dilemma has rendered blacks virtually voiceless on some pressing issues at a time when their
voices would have presumably held greater sway.
This means that Obama can get away with doing almost nothing to specifically address issues important to
African-Americans and instead focus on the white voters he's losing in droves. This has not gone unnoticed. In
the Nov. 9 Gallup poll, the number of blacks who felt that Obama would not go far enough in promoting efforts
to aid the black community jumped 60 percent from last summer to now.
The hard truth is that Obama needs white voters more than he needs black ones.
According to my analysis, even if every black person in America had stayed home on Election Day, Obama
would still be president. To a large degree, Obama was elected by white people, some of whom were more able
to accept him because he consciously portrayed himself as racially ambiguous.
In fact, commiserating with the blacks could prove politically problematic.
In a study to be published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences this month,
researchers asked subjects to rate images of the president to determine which ones best represented his "true
essence." In some of the photos, his skin had been lightened. In others, it had been darkened. The result? The
more people identified him with the "whiter" images, the more likely they were to have voted for him, and vice
versa.

The Age of Obama, so far at least, seems less about Obama as a black community game-changer than as a
White House gamesman. It's unclear if there will be a positive Obama Effect, but an Obama Backlash is
increasingly apparent. Meanwhile, black people are also living a tale of two actions: grin and bear it.

Good morning Roberta! Congratulations on a successful visit by the Secretary of State. We are looking forward to this
afternoon's teleconference. After opening remarks, Minister Cannon will ask Prime Minister Bellerive to speak and the UN
(we may only have DPKO LeRoy on line due to visit of Sec Gen to Haiti). He will then ask FM Amorim and Sec State
Clinton to provide their views on the situation and then open the floor to Kouchner and others. Response has been good
and most will be represented at FM level (Mexico/Espinosa may still be in flight from Japan, and Argentina and Costa
Rica will be Vice-Ministers).
There is as well agreement in principle to begin laying the groundwork for a broader Donors Conference on
Reconstruction and our offer to host a preparatory meeting on January 25th has been well received. However, early
indications are that the EU has a conflict as they have their General Relations and Foreign Relations meetings scheduled
for that day. As the EU would be essential for such a meeting we are scrambling to look for alternative dates. Given the
momentum we would rather go earlier than later. Minister Cannon would be available to host this on the weekend of the
23-24th of January (dinner on the 23rd, meeting on the morning of the 24th). However, I believe that Ambassador

I am looking at the article and don't know where this stands in terms of what will really happen (welcome an update) but
we should do some sort of meeting now with international gay groups to lay out what we have done.
The process will focus not only our public and quiet diplomacy (calls to pres, etc) efforts but also it will give chance for
feedback on more we should do.
I am worried this will not turn out well. We need some outreach unless I am missing what is being done in dept.
Can we do this in next several days?

Uganda to Drop Death Penalty, Life in Jail for Gays (Updatel)Last Updated: December 9, 2009 10:44 EST By Fred Ojambo
Dec. 9 (Bloomberg) -- Uganda will drop the death penalty and life imprisonment for gays in a refined version of an anti-
gay bill expected to be ready for presentation to Parliament in two weeks, James Nsaba Buturo, the minister of ethics
and integrity, said.The draft bill, which is under consideration by a parliamentary committee, will drop the two
punishments to attract the support of religious leaders who are opposed to these penalties, Buturo said today in a
phone interview from the capital, Kampala.Ugandan lawmaker David Bahati presented a private member's bill on Oct.
14 which sought the death penalty and life imprisonment for gay people in the country. The Ugandan government
supports the bill because homosexuality and lesbianism are "repugnant to the Ugandan culture," Buturo said. Still, it
favors a more refined set of punishments, he said.ln addition to formulating punishments for the gay people, the bill will
also promote counseling to help "attract errant people to acceptable sexual orientation," said Buturo.The proposed
legislation has attracted criticism from gay rights activists, both locally and internationally, who argue that the law would
promote discrimination and hatred toward the gay community.

Hi Cheryl:
Today, I was able to have good preliminary conversations with Jean Bonilla and Lorraine Hariton in EEB. Both Jean and
Lorraine are very excited about the opportunity to partner on this new area for the Secretary and provided me with
some very valuable insight and discussion on how we can partner and collaborate on programming and initiatives
together.
I also included the information from ECA —that we discussed in the document. The INR meeting was cancelled today and
will be scheduled for early next week. As I move around the Department and talk with other officials in the coming
week, I believe we will be able to build out a more robust Work Plan and garner some great collaborations on this
effort.
Additionally, in a recent conversation that I had with Governor O'Malley from Maryland, I shared with him that the
Secretary was launching a new effort that would assist state and local leaders with respect to their global affairs
portfolios. The Governor was extremely excited and remarked that he has some great idea for the Secretary about how
the Department can be a major value-add to local governments. He told me that he wants to be very engaged in what
we do in the Department in this area. I will be scheduling a time to meet with him and his economic team once my
position has been announced. He wanted me to let her know that he had been thinking about her and wanted to reach
out and did not know how and then I walked in and we began to have this discussion and he said — what a way to start
his year for 2010 — something coming to reality that he had been thinking about.
Also, Maura Pally in ECA forwarded me a meeting that I took with the Deputy Director of the National Lieutenant
Governor's Association. They were in town working on their upcoming Washington meeting. They too are very excited
about what we are planning and want to work very closely with us in the coming months as we launch this effort. Lt.
Governor Bill Bolling in VA is the current Chair.

Clinton Speech Signals Greater Emphasis on Human Rights in U.S. Policy
Washington — December 14, 2009 —
Freedom House applauds Secretary Hillary Clinton for her remarks at Georgetown University today on "A
Human Rights Agenda for the 21st Century."
Secretary Clinton's remarks setting forth the U.S. Government's human rights agenda appear to reflect an
enhanced emphasis by the Obama Administration on the importance of political democracy for the achievement
to basic human rights and broader development goals, as well. She gave special attention to the importance of
freedom of expression. The remarks build upon President Obama's Nobel acceptance speech on December 10,
in which he said "peace is unstable where citizens are denied the right to speak freely or worship as they please;
choose their own leaders or assemble without fear."
"The emphasis on universal human rights in Secretary Clinton's speech sends an important message of her
personal commitment at a time when the world is witnessing continuing global declines in fundamental rights,"
said Jennifer Windsor, Executive Director of Freedom House. "We look forward to seeing this passion
integrated into U.S. policy around the globe."
The speech stressed the necessity for a human rights policy that is fused with efforts to advance both
development and democracy.

"Human rights, democracy and development are not three separate goals with three separate agendas," said
Secretary Clinton. "To make a real and long term difference in people's lives we have to tackle all three
simultaneously."
Clinton went on to refute the idea that national security policy need take priority over human rights issues and
spoke of a "principled pragmatism" where the United States would address concerning human rights issues with
countries like China or Russia while continuing to engage with them on strategic interests. "Freedom doesn't
come in half measures," continued Clinton. "and partial remedies cannot redress the whole problem."

Amnesty International USA Statement on Secretary Clinton's speech
Monday, December 14, 2009
Larry Cox, executive director, Amnesty International USA, on Monday welcomed Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton's affirmation that protecting human rights is central to helping countries worldwide
achieve the goal of reducing or eliminating poverty. Calling her speech "historic," Cox said Clinton's
commitment to a broad spectrum of human rights offers new hope in solving the desperation caused
by poverty.
"By advancing the idea that human rights, development and participatory and accountable
governance, are goals that mutually reinforce one another, Secretary Clinton has charted a course of
leadership recognizing the indivisibility of human rights that has been missing in our government's
mission abroad and at home," said Cox. "Her statement today is an essential foundation for relieving
the suffering of billions in poverty, especially now when millions upon millions more people worldwide
are experiencing economic hardship."
"We welcome Secretary Clinton's affirmation that the "basics" of well being -- food, shelter, health and
education —are not only human rights in and of themselves, but are also essential for the exercise of
other human rights. Only by addressing both freedom from want and freedom from fear will it be
possible to achieve genuine development for all."
Cox, who attended Secretary Clinton's speech on the administration's 21st century human rights
agenda at Georgetown University, said he was especially grateful to hear Secretary Clinton outline
her determination to make a real and long-term difference by tackling human rights and development
as mutually reinforcing goals and affirm that the "United States must lead by example in this area."
Cox also welcomed Secretary Clinton's commitment to stand with human rights defenders worldwide
by shining a spotlight on their work and the legitimacy of their efforts. In her speech Secretary Clinton
highlighted the work of Women of Zimbabwe Arise, whose founders were recently honored at the
White House, and noted the State Department had sent high-level diplomatic missions to meet with
Aung San Suu Kyi in Myanmar. It is important that the administration continue to champion human
rights defenders around the world, especially those in powerful countries like China and Russia.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766180 Date: 08/31/2015
Cox also praised the Secretary for raising the question of accountability abroad and at
home. "Secretary Clinton rightly identifies accountability as the centerpiece of any successful human
rights agenda for the United States. But if the administration means what it says, then it needs to
appoint a bipartisan commission to investigate the abuses connected to counterterrorism policies
since September 11, 2001, follow through on the executive orders it already has committed to, close
the prison at Guantanamo and abide by international legal commitments to end torture."
"The administration can't insist that other countries adhere to human rights protections while
continuing to detain people outside the rule of law at home," Cox continued. "Discussion of human
rights can't be an empty rebranding exercise. The administration should promptly bring charges
against the Guantanamo detainees who can be legitimately charged with a crime, and release the
rest without further delay." To date, 116 individuals have already been cleared for release but remain
unjustly detained in Guantanamo.
Noting that in his Nobel Prize speech in Oslo, President Obama stated that "no nation can insist that
others follow the rules of the road if we are not willing to follow those rules ourselves," Cox Stated,
"Amnesty International commends the administration for its commitment to engage closely on human
rights. This is welcome change, but to make measurable progress we must prioritize accountability
for torture, implementation of human rights treaties, a strong Executive Order on Human Rights, and
the establishment of a national human rights commission."
Amnesty International is a Nobel Peace Prize-winning grassroots activist organization with more than 2.2 million
supporters, activists and volunteers in more than 150 countries campaigning for human rights worldwide. The
organization investigates and exposes abuses, educates and mobilizes the public, and works to protect people wherever
justice, freedom, truth and dignity are denied.

Katie and Caitlin:
I know you know, but want you to know we all know as does the Secretary how without your pushing and
making it happen, there would have been no video. Katie, your constant can-do attitude, hectoring to get us
to review the concepts and the scripts, and positive attitude that it would be great truly was critical. Not to
mention your conceptual eye that bettered the outcome. Caitlin, your analysis, outreach, and notion that a
celebrity would in fact do this was so valuable.
Many thanks to you both — it was the highlight.

Capricia is spot on..she is an amazing mentor and guiding force.
When she came up with the idea for the lunch, she said she wanted everyone to walk away feeling like that was time
well spent. She achieved that and more.
I'm thrilled to be a part of it all.
Thanks again!

Attachments: 2009-09-28 Senior Leadership Retreat - Discussion Draft - Revised2.docx
Attached and below is the proposed final Retreat Agenda.
The chief challenge I see is in having each bureau give 3 minutes on their top 3 priorities.
I think it is worthwhile from the standpoint that this is the first time all will be together with the chance to see/meet and
hear from everyone, but it will take time to hear from everyone. I've broken it up into 2 sections of an hour
each. Without these sections, the Retreat would breathe — with them it's tight though I have left padding in each
section.
I also am holding a place for up front for Susan Rice to present if she comes — she has not rsvped.
Please see below and attached and advise if there are other suggested changes.
Bill Burns cannot attend the retreat and currently will give his update on Iran to Jim; we also will have Jim address Iraq in
his overview too.

Africa's Anti-Gay Laws Spark Accusations and Denials in US

Evangelical pastor Rick Warren, 23 Jun 2009
Anti-gay laws sweeping through East Africa have sparked a debate in the United States about the possible
influence of American evangelical leaders and lawmakers with strong ties in that region. U.S. activists are also
shedding new light on the risks that gays face in East Africa.
In his book called The Family, American journalist Jeff Sharlet criticizes a group of influential American
Christian leaders and conservative lawmakers with close ties to politicians in East Africa.
He accuses them of treating some of the countries they deal with as social and political experiments.
"It has become sort of a Frankenstein's monster and is the family going to take responsibility for the
empowerment they have given to some of these politicians?," asked Jeff Sharlet.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766390 Date: 08/31/2015
In his book, Sharlet specifically refers to politicians in Uganda proposing an anti-gay law that would criminalize
homosexuality. The law, which could be passed within weeks despite international condemnation, includes
possible punishment by death.
Anti-gay laws were recently passed in Burundi, are being discussed in Rwanda, and could soon be expanded in
Kenya and Tanzania.
The American group Sharlet calls The Family is also known as The Fellowship. It organizes an annual National
Prayer Breakfast with the U.S. president and foreign guests, but besides that activity shuns publicity and does
not openly list its members.
But Sharlet says more American reporters are looking into the group and its alleged ties to Africa. These
include helping African politicians with money so they can push socially conservative agendas.
"We see reporters in Iowa, in Pennsylvania, and in Oklahoma, going to their elected representatives who have a
link to this whole thing and saying 'tell us about the link'," he said. "They are not accusing them of anything,
they are saying, 'You have a relationship with the Ugandan government, what is the nature of that
relationship? And, are you going to use that influence to oppose this legislation that seems to be supported by
some of your allies?"
Religious leaders like Rick Warren have also been under the microscope. He is the senior pastor of the
California-based Saddleback church, which is active in both Uganda and Rwanda.
After being questioned about his role by U.S. media, Warren issued a video message on the Internet, denying
his support for the law in Uganda.
"As an American pastor, it is not my role to interfere with the politics of other nations, but it is my role to speak
out on moral issues and it is my role to shepherd other pastors who look to me for guidance, and it is my role to
correct lies and errors and false reports when others associate my name with a law that I had nothing to do with,
[and which] I completely oppose and I vigorously condemn," said Rick Warren. "I am referring to the pending
law under consideration by the Ugandan parliament, known as the Anti-Homosexuality Bill."
Rwanda's parliament is also working to pass a law which would criminalize homosexuality but Warren has yet
to address his church's role in that matter. In 2005, he called Rwanda a "purpose driven nation." Warren went
with dozens of American evangelicals to hold meetings with government ministers, lawmakers and donate
materials to churches across Rwanda.
Several American lawmakers who have been linked to the Fellowship, like Nevada Senator John Ensign have
called the Ugandan law proposal "outrageous". But others like Kansas Senator Sam Brownback, who went to
Uganda in 2004, have said they do not know enough about the bill to comment.
The executive director of the U.S.-based International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission, Cary Alan
Johnson, welcomes some of the questions now being asked.
"It is a debate that has to happen and we are glad it is happening," said Cary Alan Johnson. "Rwanda and
Uganda are both countries with deeply spiritual people and as of late we have understood that some of the more
conservative elements in the United States have been funding the most violent and homophobic discourses
about homosexuality."
Johnson says those seeking to push an agenda should understand the consequences of their actions. He warns
anti-gay laws could worsen already high HIV levels in east Africa.

"The impact of these laws on HIV prevention is extremely worrisome to us," he said. "Laws we are talking
about in Uganda, Rwanda, will make it impossible for groups to do HIV education that targets men who have
sex with men or that targets bisexual people and we know that there is a strong impact of HIV on this
community and on society in general."
Lisa Laurel Weinberg, from the Massachusetts Lutheran Social Services Human Rights Protection Project, says
the situation is already very difficult. In her other job as an asylum attorney, she recently helped a young
Ugandan woman win asylum to the United States. The woman's apartment had been raided by police while she
was inside with her girlfriend.
"The police broke in and brought them to the police station and raped them in what is called a corrective rape,"
said Lisa Laurel Weinberg. "It is when males of authority try and correct lesbianism through rape."
But Weinberg warns trying to fight the new laws from the outside is very complicated.
"I got an e-mail yesterday that said be really careful and check with Ugandans before you do any advocacy from
the West, because us imposing our values, they are really sensitive to the whole colonialism history, so that the
email cautioned be careful what you do and let it come from them," she said.
Some prominent politicians and journalists in East Africa have called homosexuality the "white man's
disease." Pro-gay groups in the region, which are mostly underground, say they are becoming increasingly
afraid to ask for help, and believe outside interference could worsen the persecution they face.

I think I would want someone higher profile.
If she is doing this, it's likely as a response to incoming rather than as an affirmative agenda.
Not sure how I got to be the person pushing all things in this area -- think from the earlier efforts on family benefits but
as general matter - we have a reactive mechanism right now (to others, to me sending emails re Uganda (and now
Rwanda is doing same kind of anti-gay law)) etc.
This would be someone who's portfolio would be an affirmative agenda.

It may be worth putting together a small group to think through the issue in some depth to decide whether there is a more
proactive strategy that may be possible and/or worth engaging in one or more countries :
1. Define human rights challenges around gay communities in many of our partner countries
2. Define the social political context (ie: how does civil society and the political/legislative activity converge or not
converge)
3. Potential role of Judicial response (eg: Adult Disability Act in US)
4. Role of multilateral and normative bodies
We are quietly doing this in PEPFAR over the next two months to assess whether we can work behind the politics to
increase the "safe space" for our populations seeking and/or in care (increase identification, entry and retention).

U.S. Envoy's Cables Show Concerns on Afghan
War Plans
By ERIC SCHMITT
WASHINGTON — The United States ambassador in Kabul warned his superiors here in
November that President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan "is not an adequate strategic
partner" and "continues to shun responsibility for any sovereign burden," according to a
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766418 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766418 Date: 08/31/2015
classified cable that offers a much bleaker accounting of the risks of sending additional
American troops to Afghanistan than was previously known.
The broad outlines of two cables from the ambassador, Karl W. Eikenberry, became public
within days after he sent them, and they were portrayed as having been the source of
significant discussion in the White House, heightening tensions between diplomats and
senior military officers, who supported an increase of 30,000 American troops.
But the full cables, obtained by The New York Times, show for the first time just how
strongly the current ambassador felt about the leadership of the Afghan government, the
state of its military and the chances that a troop buildup would actually hurt the war effort
by making the Karzai government too dependent on the United States.
The cables — one four pages, the other three — also represent a detailed rebuttal to the
counterinsurgency strategy offered by Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the top American and
NATO commander in Afghanistan, who had argued that a rapid infusion of fresh troops
was essential to avoid failure in the country.
They show that Mr. Eikenberry, a retired Army lieutenant general who once was the top
American commander in Afghanistan, repeatedly cautioned that deploying sizable
American reinforcements would result in "astronomical costs" — tens of billions of dollars
— and would only deepen the dependence of the Afghan government on the United States.
"Sending additional forces will delay the day when Afghans will take over, and make it
difficult, if not impossible, to bring our people home on a reasonable timetable," he wrote
Nov. 6. "An increased U.S. and foreign role in security and governance will increase
Afghan dependence, at least in the short-term."
Without offering details, Mr. Eikenberry has said in public hearings since then that his
concerns have been dealt with, and that he supported the White House's troop increase
plan.
But it is not clear what might have changed about his assessment of President Karzai as a
reliable partner, and the strong language of the cables may increase tensions between the
ambassador and the Karzai government, especially as world leaders meet in London on
Thursday to discuss a much-debated Afghan plan to reintegrate Taliban fighters. It also
coincides with a strong effort by the administration to mend ties with Mr. Karzai.
An American official provided a copy of the cables to The Times after a reporter requested
them. The official said it was important for the historical record that Mr. Eikenberry's
detailed assessments be made public, given that they were among the most important
documents produced during the debate that led to the troop buildup.

On Nov. 6, Mr. Eikenberry wrote: "President Karzai is not an adequate strategic partner.
The proposed counterinsurgency strategy assumes an Afghan political leadership that is
both able to take responsibility and to exert sovereignty in the furtherance of our goal — a
secure, peaceful, minimally self-sufficient Afghanistan hardened against transnational
terrorist groups.
"Yet Karzai continues to shun responsibility for any sovereign burden, whether defense,
governance or development. He and much of his circle do not want the U.S. to leave and
are only too happy to see us invest further," Mr. Eikenberry wrote. "They assume we covet
their territory for a never-ending 'war on terror' and for military bases to use against
surrounding powers."
He continued, "Beyond Karzai himself, there is no political ruling class that provides an
overarching national identity that transcends local affiliations and provides reliable
partnership."
In a second cable, dated Nov. 9, he expressed new concerns: "In a PBS interview on
November 7, Karzai sounded bizarrely cautionary notes about his willingness to address
governance and corruption. This tracks with his record of inaction or grudging compliance
in this area."
On Monday, Mr. Eikenberry declined through an embassy spokeswoman, Caitlin M.
Hayden, to comment on the cables and his views on Mr. Karzai. She said by e-mail, "We
stand by what we provided during the review process, which got us to the clear strategy
we're now implementing, that the ambassador unequivocally supports."
In his memos, Mr. Eikenberry raised other concerns. He said he had serious doubts about
the ability of the Afghan police and military forces to take over security duties in the
country by 2013. "The Army's high attrition and low recruitment rates for Pashtuns in the
south are crippling," he wrote. "Simply keeping the force at current levels requires tens of
thousands of new recruits every year to replace attrition losses and battlefield casualties."
The ambassador, who left the military last April to become Mr. Obama's emissary, also
complained about an inadequate civilian counterpart organization to the NATO military
command in Afghanistan. Nearly three months later, he is still expressing concerns about
too few civilian experts in Afghanistan.
He also noted worries that the success of Mr. Obama's Afghanistan policy hinged on
Pakistani forces' eliminating militants' havens in the mountainous region near the Afghan
border.

"Pakistan will remain the single greatest source of Afghan instability so long as the border
sanctuaries remain," he wrote. "Until this sanctuary problem is fully addressed, the gains
from sending additional forces may be fleeting."
"As we contemplate greatly expanding our presence in Afghanistan, the better answer to
our difficulties could well be to further ratchet up our engagement in Pakistan," he wrote
without elaboration.
On Nov. 9, he repeatedly warned against rushing into a large deployment of more
American forces without further study.
He urged that the White House appoint a bipartisan panel of "civilian and military experts
to examine the Afghanistan-Pakistan strategy" and provide recommendations by the end
of 2009. The recommendation, which would have extended a White House-led policy
review of many months, was not accepted.
Mr. Eikenberry suggested sending a relatively small force to train Afghan security forces
and protect some population centers, and to condition more troops on the Afghans'
meeting objectives, like committing to taking full responsibility for national defense by a
specific date.
And while General McChrystal warned of failure if additional troops were not deployed,
Mr. Eikenberry concluded by cautioning of competing risks "that we will become more
deeply engaged here with no way to extricate ourselves, short of allowing the country to
descend again into lawlessness and chaos."

I went for news and indeed Guy is right. The meeting occurred yesterday and the decision was made to revoke
the government on October 29. I wonder what happened with the initial decision which was strictly concerning
Minister Dorsainvil and which was for November 20th or 21st.The idea had been sold that Michele should not be
touched as the President did not care to have a vacuum in these electoral times. Plus, Michele was finally
regarded as ambitionless (not seeking presidential powers) which is not a bad thing under the
circumstances. Apparently, she, not being amenable to sacrificing some of her Ministers... and again, she being
the one to name their replacements, has brought about the decision to do away with her altogether. The trouble
is that nobody seems willing to counter the President with whom the instructions have originated. It is a head to
head.match between the Prime Minister and the President. That is obviously not good. Nobody will stand
against the President elect for the Prime Minister appointed.
I will have two meetings with separate parliamentarians tomorrow. On one end the ones voting to oust her on
the other the week opposition. The frustrating thing is that none have allegiance to her, just as none have the

Cheryl, Meghann,
Below is some intel David got on the Mexico conference David picked up from the Mexicans here. The conference's
timing would be extremely awkward if things proceed as Guy Noel suggests:
Guy reports that "they" have decided to go forward with:
1)October 29th Interpellation (Impeachment) of the PM
2) Oct. 31St the president will add the ratification of the new PM on the existing list of the LOWER HOUSE activities
(which Guy asserts is illegal)
3) November 3rd Nomination of the new PM
4) Then the ratification of the PM
You can bet that the PM will repeat all this verbatim to George Soros when she sees him today. Not sure what - if
anything - that will provoke.
got this information too and has a pre-scheduled meeting with Preval today. I understand he plans on
raising this. We'll let you know what we hear.
In my Tuesday lunch with Gabriel I mentioned in very clear terms our concern about any sort of turmoil in government
reflecting very badly on the international community's efforts to tout Haiti as stable and open for investment. He said
he understood. He said, "I don't see Michelle (Pierre-Louis) going anywhere soon." He conceded that while Preval did
have a majority in Parliament, he could not control all parliamentarians on all issues.
We'll try and get in to see someone from the Senate in the coming days.
This is why a call would be most useful.

international community's engagement with Haiti (both political and assistance), but that it has morphed into a donor's
meeting to discuss coordination of assistance. Originally they planned to invite Foreign Ministers, but now they are
inviting the heads of assistance agencies. Preval was originally to attend, but he has decided to send his Foreign
Minister and the Minister of Planning. Romero indicated that the GOM has not received the number and caliber of
confirmations of attendance that they had hoped for. I asked Romero what outcome the GOM would like to see from
the meeting, and he said that they want to encourage donors to coordinate more with the GOH and among themselves.
The GOM hosted an "experts" meeting on Haiti two weeks ago where a number of individuals long involved in Haiti
presented position papers on the political, economic and assistance challenges in Haiti. He said that a common theme
of the papers was the need for greater donor coordination. He will send me a set of the position papers. Mexico is not a
donor to Haiti.

State Dept IG: Exchange programs need closer watch
Oct 23 04:27 PM US/Eastern
By MICHAEL RUBINKAM
Associated Press Writer
SCRANTON, Pa. (AP) - The nation's foreign exchange student programs need better federal oversight, the State
Department's internal watchdog concludes in a new report following a scandal in which students were placed in
shoddy homes in Pennsylvania.
Acting Inspector General Harold Geisel said in the report, released this week, the department's Bureau of
Educational and Cultural Affairs has largely abdicated its responsibility to ensure the well-being of thousands of
exchange students who come to the United States each year.
Instead, the sponsoring organizations themselves have been left to monitor their own programs and self-report
problems to federal regulators, the report said.
"There are insufficient dedicated resources at ECA to conduct effective oversight of youth exchange programs," the
report said.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766463 Date: 07/31/2015
The inspector geneial began its review in July, following allegations that an employee of a San Francisco-based
exchange program placed students in filthy homes around Scranton in northeastern Pennsylvania. Edna Burgette
was fired from Aspect Foundation after being charged in July with five felony counts of criminal negligence.
Aspect said it deplored Burgette's actions and had no prior knowledge of the neglect, but the agency was penalized
by the State Department.
"We're absolutely committed to strengthening our programs, making them the best they can be and ensuring that all
students have safe and rewarding experiences," Maura Pally, acting assistant secretary of state for educational and
cultural affairs, told The Associated Press on Friday.
In the wake of the Scranton case, the bureau added staff, established a separate unit to conduct site visits, e-mailed
current students to inquire about how their experiences are going, and set up a database to track problems, among
other fixes meant to improve oversight.
Also, proposed federal regulations would tighten requirements for host families and set up more rigorous
background checks.
"We acknowledge there were serious problems with our monitoring and oversight, and we agree with the IG's
assessment that things needed to change," Pally said. "The way things were operating was just not acceptable, and
we began making changes even before the report was released."

Report calls for more oversight of student exchange
programs
• STORY HIGHLIGHTS
• Inspector general's report cites programs receiving State Department grants
• Report calls for stronger monitoring of youth placement groups
• Report comes after some foreign students complained of neglect, abuse
• Report: Establish requirements for criminal history checks of host families
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Youth exchange programs receiving U.S. State Department grants are suffering from
insufficient oversight and attention from the federal government, according to an inspector general's report
released Thursday.
An inspector general's report calls for more oversight of student exchange programs.
The report calls for stronger monitoring of youth placement groups that receive federal grants to sponsor
exchange students. It finds that the department has been "relying instead on the coordinator to self-monitor."
Participants in the exchange programs are typically 15 to 18 and are among "the most vulnerable," according
to the report.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766463 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766463 Date: 07/31/2015
In 2008, the State Department gave 17 such groups $39.4 million in taxpayer funds to manage programs
involving exchange students.
One of those groups, Aspect Foundation, received $1.08 million of those funds. However, Aspect came under
fire this year after students from Europe, Africa and South America — whom the California-based foundation
had placed in Scranton, Pennsylvania -- came forward with allegations of mistreatment and abandonment.
CNN aired a detailed report on the case in July, after which the State Department said it would set up a toll-
free telephone number that foreign exchange students could use to report problems and tighten its oversight of
government-funded exchange student programs.
The inspector general's report notes that previous audits of the State Department's Bureau of Educational and
Cultural Affairs (ECA), which also found deficiencies in program oversight, found the department slow to make
changes.
"The incidents in Northeastern Pennsylvania were allowed to happen, in part, because of a lack of clear
regulations that allowed sponsor organizations to interpret the rules in a manner that ultimately endangered
these students," said Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pennsylvania, on Thursday.
In May, Casey pushed for an investigation into the Department of State's oversight of youth exchange
programs following reports out of Scranton.
One student was placed in a Scranton home with a person who had been convicted of a drug-related felony,
Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, District Attorney Andrew Jarbola has told CNN. Some students were so
malnourished that one was treated in a hospital for dehydration; another was put up in a home that was later
condemned by the city, he said.
The families that housed the students say the allegations are untrue. The Aspect Foundation first denied any
problems existed, then said it had corrected them and fired those responsible.
The State Department sanctioned Aspect by reducing the number of students it can bring over for the 2010-
2011 school year, a penalty that amounted to a loss of revenue of about $540,000, according to the
department.
"We at the Department of State recognize [because we] are responsible for this program we have to make
sure we are aggressively overseeing this program and make sure children are well-suited," said State
Department spokesman P.J. Crowley at the time.
The inspector general's report released Thursday does not specifically mention Aspect. It does review four
State Department programs, including Youth Exchange Study (YES) and the Future Leaders Exchange
(FLEX), both of which have given grants to the foundation.
The report calls on the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, which oversees the grant programs, to
establish requirements for criminal history checks of host families and put more resources into site visits at
placement groups.
"The Department of State has taken action to rectify its failure in the oversight and monitoring of exchange
programs," Casey said. "However, the real measure of progress will be what specific steps are taken to
prevent this problem from happening again."

My blackberry is down so I'm sending you a quick note from Uganda via Ambassador Jerry Lanier's account.
I met this morning with President Museveni in Entebbe. I raised with him the issue of the draconian
legislation proposed to criminalize homosexual activity. Museveni was unaware of the legislation but thought
it was excessive and out of order. He said he would work with members of Parliament to revise the legislation
to make it a crime for adults to solicit or recruit minors into any homo- or heterosexual activities. Activities
between consenting adults would be stripped from the legislation. I think we rolled the worst and most
concerning part of this back.

Subject: Lugar Remarks tonight
Speech of Senator Lugar
Foreign Assistance and Development in a New Era
Thursday, January 28, 2010
U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar will deliver the following speech tonight at the Society for International Development's annual
dinner.
I thank the Society for International Development, its members and its leadership - Betsy Bassan and Joe Feuer - for
the work they do on development issues around the world, and for organizing this annual gala. It is unfortunate that
Chairman Kerry could not be with us tonight, but I know he shares my gratitude for your recognition.
I also want to take this opportunity to thank Dr. Shah for his remarks and to recognize the efforts of USAID and its
new Administrator in responding to the tragic earthquake in Haiti. Dr. Shah has faced one of the most challenging
crises imaginable only five days after being sworn in. The job ahead of him - in Haiti and around the globe - is
monumental. I look forward to supporting his work and that of his agency in the coming years. I commend all of our
responders from all government agencies for their courage, compassion, and skill as they continue their mission in
Haiti, and I join all of you in extending our prayers to the people of that nation.
Tonight I would like to offer a few points about where we have come from and where we might be going with regard
to U.S. investments in development.
The challenges of global poverty and hunger are growing at a time when worries about the sustainability of natural
resources are increasing. Population growth and increased affluence in some parts of the globe will require that we
more than double world food production by 2050 to keep pace. At the same time, to address environmental concerns,
we will have to harvest that food from roughly the same amount of land that is in production today. The accessibility
and availability of food deeply affects the health of populations. Childhood malnutrition has lifelong consequences for
the productivity of individuals and nations. Poverty denies opportunity to the world's young people and breeds
extremism and instability that spills over borders. It is not surprising that the CIA has long tracked and analyzed
global food supplies as an indicator of potential conflict.
There is probably not a person in this room who would disagree that development is critical for U.S. national security
and that the alleviation of poverty and hunger is a key component. This is a sentiment that is shared in most parts of
our government, including the Department of Defense.
But even though the importance of advancing development goals is evident, constructing the most efficient,
accountable, and transparent means for achieving those goals is complex and challenging. Differences of opinion exist
with regard to who should be performing development functions and how these activities should be integrated into our
broader foreign policy efforts. We have not reached a consensus within our government on who should be doing what,
where, when and why.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766534 Date: 08/31/2015
As we debate these issues, we should keep in mind that diplomacy and development are two distinct disciplines.
Although diplomacy and development often can be mutually reinforcing, at their core, they have different priorities,
resource requirements, and time horizons. Most obviously, diplomacy is far more concerned with solving immediate
problems, usually associated with countries of strategic interest. Although we hope that our development efforts will
sometimes yield short-term strategic benefits, that is not their primary purpose. In a development context, we are
willing to take a much longer view of the world and devote resources to countries of less, or even minimal, strategic
significance. We are willing to allow the diplomatic and national security benefits of development work to accrue over
time. And we are willing to engage in missions for purely altruistic reasons. These differences underscore why
development must be an independent partner of diplomacy, not merely its servant.
Reforming U.S. Foreign Assistance
Reforming U.S. foreign assistance - in both substance and architecture - has been a priority for the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee. Secretary Clinton has stated: "I want USAID to be seen as the premier development agency in
the world." I share that sentiment. One of the basic questions with respect to foreign aid reform is how we can best
strengthen the capacity of USAID to run effective assistance programs. During the last two decades, decision-makers
have not made it easy for the agency to perform its mission. Development resources declined precipitously in the
1990s and reorganization initiatives resulted in the agency's loss of evaluation, budget, and policy capacity. There is
broad consensus among development experts that the loss of these functions at USAID is inhibiting the success of our
development programs. Our development efforts will never be as effective as they should be if the agency that houses
most of our development expertise is cut out of relevant policy and budget decisions.
Events since 2001 have spurred greater investments in foreign assistance. But many of these resources have been
located outside of USAID. Roughly two dozen departments and agencies have taken over some aspects of foreign
assistance, including the Department of Defense and the Department of Agriculture.
The President has advocated doubling foreign assistance over time, and has announced new initiatives on food
security and health. Given the increased resources needed for these initiatives, it is crucial that the American people
and Congress have confidence that these funds will be used efficiently.
USAID must have a central role in development policy decisions. If we are to avoid inefficient experimentation, it must
have the capacity to evaluate programs and disseminate information about best practices and methods. That requires
policy makers to continue augmenting the agency's staffing and expertise. These principals are reflected in legislation
that Senator Kerry and I introduced last year, S. 1524, the Foreign Assistance Revitalization and Accountability Act.
The Administration has initiated two separate studies - the State Department's Quadrennial Diplomacy and
Development Review and the National Security Council's Presidential Study Directive on Development - in an attempt
to make recommendations on how development programs can better support U.S. foreign policy objectives. The
QDDR will not be completed until this fall and it is uncertain when, or if, we will know the outcomes of the PSD.
I am eager to review the Administration's ideas when they are ready. But in the meantime, Congress should be
offering its own ideas on how to improve our government's development capacity. The Kerry-Lugar foreign assistance
reform bill is the product of well over a year of research and analysis by Senators and their staffs. It has strong
support in the aid community. And it is co-sponsored by a bipartisan group of 23 Senators, twelve of whom are
members of the Foreign Relations Committee. This level of backing for a bill related to foreign assistance is extremely
rare. It provides an opportunity to build something approaching a consensus on this issue. I am hopeful that the
Executive Branch will recognize that a bill co-sponsored by a majority of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and
nearly a quarter of the full Senate should be given substantial weight in its review process. A strong development
agency that serves under the foreign policy guidance of the Secretary of State, as envisioned in our bill, will best
empower her to advance U.S. goals.
A Development Policy Guided by Objectives
Even as we reconsider our development architecture, it is vital that development policy is guided by objectives rather
than by how we organize our government to deliver development assistance. We should focus on the big issues - food
scarcity, poverty, disease, environmental degradation -- that prevent economic growth in a large swath of the world's
countries. Those objectives require that strategies reflect the needs of the countries we are helping rather than the
vagaries of our own budget process, which often allocates funds in response to lobbying pressures, media interest, or
political favoritism. Country strategies based on broad objectives also give us the best chance to avoid dependence on
arbitrary spending targets for specific sectors. For example, promoting food security requires investments not just in
agricultural productivity, but in clean water, infrastructure, basic and higher education, and land titling, to name just a
few factors.
The Global Food Security Act, which I authored with Senator Casey and which Senator Kerry has co-sponsored,
reflects these principles. The food price crisis that occurred in 2008 resulted from a culmination of policy choices by
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766534 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766534 Date: 08/31/2015
donor and recipient governments over a decades-long period. That crisis was a wakeup call for the development
community, for international donors, and for policymakers worldwide. Because achieving food security must be a
multi-sector endeavor that goes beyond simply raising crop yields, U.S. policy must seek to integrate a variety of
approaches and actors. At the same time, we do not want to delegate responsibility for food security policy to multiple
departments. That could further weaken our already fractured foreign assistance structure. That is why our bill
designates USAID, which has the broad development experience necessary, as the lead agency to implement the
strategy.
"Whole-of-Government" in Perspective
The term "whole-of-government" has come into vogue in policy circles. To the extent that the term underscores the
complexity of development problems and the need to apply the talents of a diverse set of agencies to their solution, it
is useful and descriptive. Our government must have the capacity to draw on expertise to achieve vital development
missions without artificial barriers erected by agencies. Many agencies are working together successfully on
development problems in many parts of the world.
But we should not mistake the term "whole-of-government" for an organizational strategy. Even if multiple agencies
are making contributions, someone must be in charge, someone must coordinate the activities of all involved, and
someone must take responsibility for inefficiencies and failures.
This is especially important in a development context because of our highly fragmented aid system. The risk is that
the term "whole-of-government," will be used to justify that fragmentation or preserve roles for agencies where they
are not justified. We also must be careful that the whole-of-government concept does not re-define development as a
series of technical decisions - from where to dig wells to which seeds to plant in which soils. Such a redefinition would
devalue the discipline of development, which many practitioners have spent a lifetime studying and testing. We know
from long experience that technical expertise must be grounded in an understanding of development. For example,
agricultural advancement depends as much or more on reaching women farmers, building agriculture education, and
engaging civil society in support of rural development than it does on seed quality and planting decisions. An
integrated strategy can only come from an agency that understands development is a separate discipline, as Dr. Shah
has said.
I believe the starting point for any future design of our assistance programs should not be the status quo, but rather
the period in which we had a well-functioning and well-resourced aid agency. Even if we emphasize the talents of
multiple agencies, a strong aid agency that can design integrated country-specific strategies is a key to success.
Unity of Purpose
Instead of accepting whole-of-government, or any other organizational model, as the guiding narrative, I believe
there is a more helpful way of viewing the development mission - that is "unity-of-purpose." We need to be unified
around common purposes for which we can marshal the appropriate level of resources and variety of approaches.
There will be situations that call for the involvement of multiple agencies under the direction of one government
entity. But, the decision to involve other government actors should be driven by the purpose. Such is clearly the case
now in Haiti. The U.S. government and international actors are unified for the purpose of disaster response. That
response involves the coordination of hundreds of organizations to rescue people and to provide basic elements
needed for survival. At some point soon, the mission will evolve from disaster response to reconstruction to
development. We should be asking whether we will be able to maintain a unity-of-purpose even as that purpose
changes.
The Lugar-Casey bill proposes that there be a unity-of-purpose around achieving global food security. Regardless of
the situation, it is the unity-of-purpose that should guide how foreign assistance is designed. I applaud Secretary
Clinton for adopting food security as a top priority. Her inter-agency team has been working diligently on its Global
Food Security and Hunger Initiative, and Congress has been responsive in appropriating funding. Many operational
decisions have yet to be made, particularly decisions relating to coordination, but I stand ready to work with the
Administration to pass the Lugar-Casey bill as soon as possible. I look forward to achieving a unity-of-purpose
between Congress and the Administration on food security.
These are not easy issues to solve. I applaud all of you here tonight for your dedication to development and your
willingness to work with Congress and the Administration as we try to rebuild our assistance infrastructure. I would
conclude with a quote from Dr. Norman Borlaug, the Nobel Laureate and Father of the Green Revolution, whose
optimism never flagged. He believed that constant striving would eventually wear down all obstacles. He said, "I
cannot emphasize too strongly the fact that further progress depends on intelligent, integrated and persistent effort
by government leaders, statesmen, tradesmen, scientists, educators and communication agencies." That is as true
today as when he said it 39 years ago, and I invite everyone here to make their own contributions in that spirit.

uilding Haiti's Economy, One Mango at a Time
By PAUL COLLIER and JEAN-LOUIS WARNHOLZ
IN an astonishing outpouring of generosity, nearly half of American households have
donated money to help Haiti recover from the recent earthquake. The United States
government and other governments around the world, for their part, have sent thousands
of relief workers and have pledged 5$i billion so far. But Haitians need something more
fundamental than relief from the present situation; they need jobs that they can count on
for years ahead. For this, the private business sector is essential. Luckily, business leaders
are meeting now in Davos, Switzerland, and Haiti is prominent on their agenda.
Haiti is by far the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, and yet it need not be so,
because unexploited economic opportunities abound there. Some of the best mangoes in
the world grow in Haiti — though too many of them rot, offshore from the world's largest
market, for want of adequate roads and well-governed ports. Excellent coffee is grown in
the Haitian mountains, but much of it is sold informally across the border to coffee
producers in the Dominican Republic, who reap most of the profits.
Haiti also has many qualities attractive to tourists: a warm climate; magnificent white-
sand beaches and turquoise water; Tortuga, the famous pirate island off the northern

coast; and the Citadel, a mountain fortress erected after Haiti's independence in the early
19th century to fend off colonial powers, now a World Heritage site. Still, it is one of the
least visited places in the Caribbean.
The Hope II trade pact with the United States, signed in 2008, granted Haiti duty-free
access to the American apparel market for the next decade. Already, as a result of the deal,
many garment factories situated along Haiti's eastern border (so as to use Dominican
electricity and ports) have become profitable and competitive with Chinese garment
makers. But light manufacturing could be much bigger in Haiti — if the Haitian
government and donors would credibly commit to providing functioning roads, electrical
grids and ports, and if outside private capital would invest, patiently, in Haitian
businesses.
Poverty and a history of coups and trade embargoes have pushed Haiti's reputation as a
place to do business to near the bottom of the global pile, alongside countries like
Afghanistan, Somalia and Iraq. But Haiti is far safer and offers far more market
opportunities than those conflict-ridden nations.
The obvious difficulty in Haiti is that its economic center, Port-au-Prince, is now in
shambles. Private investors are naturally wary of jumping into a market too soon, before it
is lively enough to provide certain kinds of support. After all, many businesses can be
profitable only if other businesses exist alongside them. Ships don't sail directly from Haiti
to Florida because there aren't enough goods to warrant dedicated routes. In the
meantime, without reliable routes for direct export of goods, investment in production in
Haiti is stymied.
Even within a single manufacturing sector, it helps to have many businesses operating
together. Garment factories, for example, cluster together, because they share a common
need for support services. In Haiti, the cluster of garment makers has been too small even
to keep repair shops in business; it can take weeks to fly in a technician to fix a broken
sewing machine. So, production costs are high because there are too few investors, and
there are too few investors because costs are so high.
The way to address this chicken-and-egg problem is for individual private investors to
coordinate with one another. This would not be a new strategy; in the 19th century, the
American West was developed not as a process of gradual diffusion but in spasms of local
investment booms, financed by enthusiastic outsiders. The earthquake could usher in such
a boom in Haiti.
The World Economic Forum in Davos provides an opportunity for businesses that might
invest in Haiti — international fashion brands, hotels and coffee chains, for example — to

coordinate with companies that provide logistics and markets, so that together they could
make mutual commitments. The foundation for such coordination has already been laid —
by Bill Clinton, who led 200 international investors to Haiti last October. As a result of this
effort, international chains like Best Western and Choice Hotels started building new
hotels in Haiti.
The earthquake has, of course, changed opportunities in Haiti, but it has not necessarily
reduced them. The American construction industry is mired in deep recession and so has
the excess capacity to meet Haiti's sudden need for low-cost housing, roads, bridges and
other structures. If American construction firms can harness Haitian labor to reconstruct
(safer) homes, then the challenge will be to lure other businesses in their wake so that
temporary jobs in reconstruction are replaced by long-term jobs in manufacturing,
agriculture and tourism.
In meeting this challenge, banks and private venture capital also have an important role to
play. Haiti needs generous venture capital that encourages some firms to move in first.
George Soros , the investor and philanthropist, has recognized this need by committing
$25 million for smart investments that catalyze Haiti's competitive advantages. Many
more such commitments are needed.
For now, even public sources of risk capital like the World Bank's International Finance
Corporation and Britain's Commonwealth Development Corporation have no special
provision for the kind of coordinated pump-priming investment that's required in Haiti.
Most public capital goes to emerging market economies where private investment no
longer needs to be encouraged. Haiti, with its genuine opportunities and immediate needs,
provides a chance for public finance organizations to find new relevance. It is also a chance
for private business to show it can take a major role in meeting the gravest human needs.
Paul Collier, an economics professor at Oxford, was a special adviser on Haiti to the
United Nations secretary general in 2009. Jean-Louis Warnholz, the managing director
of a business consulting company, was an economic adviser to Haiti's prime minister in
2009.

Here is text
Haiti's earthquake devastated not only lives, but whatever emergency
services the barely functioning government had to offer. However, in
less than seven days, a makeshift version of 911 sprung to life.
It's a striking story of how a few tech-savvy social entrepreneurs,
receptive ears in the U.S. government and hundreds of Haitian
Creole-speaking strangers crowdsourced from around the world were able
to help people on the ground get food or medical attention.
Hours after the earthquake struck Port au Prince, 23-year-old Josh
Nesbit (pictured right), who heads a non-profit delivering health care
in Sub-Saharan Africa through mobile phones, thought that an SMS
gateway would be critical in Haiti.
He sent a tweet out asking for help. A Cameroonian managing a startup
incubator in Africa, Jean Francis Ahanda, responded mentioning that a
contact, Jean-Marc Castera, was headed to the command center of the
Caribbean's largest wireless carrier Digicel that day.
Within three days, they had co-opted a shortcode, 4636, that had been
used for weather information in Haiti. They rushed to get several
other partners like Ushahidi, which provides an open-source platform
for tracking crisis communications, and Google on board. A non-profit
that specializes in using technology for disaster relief, Instedd,
built an emergency information system using the shortcode. On a very
late Saturday night, a cobbled-together team of a half-dozen
organizations or so launched '4636' as an emergency number.
They started publicizing it on the ground in Haiti through radio
stations. Haitians could text the number with messages about injuries,
people trapped under rubble or reports of missing people.
Some of them are desperate:
"My name is J my brother is working in Unicef and I live in
C 11 A I have 2 people that is still alive under the building
still ! Send Help!"
Two San Francisco-based startups, Crowdf lower and Samasource, came

on-board to help find volunteers to translate and categorize the
messages. Both are in the "Mechanical Turk" space — they farm out
simple, rote tasks that computing can't solve to thousands of people
at a time. (Crowdflower is a venture-backed startup while Samasource
is a non-profit that gives this work to refugees and people in the
poorest parts of the world, including Haiti.)
Crowdflower and Samasource asked for people around the world fluent in
Haitian-Creole to translate and prioritize emergency texts coming out
of Haiti. So far, a few hundred have signed up. (See the map below.)
Nesbit admits the privacy situation isn't perfect, but the project
helps people in dire need.
Another contact, Katie Stanton, who was an early Google employee and
is now the Director of Citizen Participation at the State Department,
helped get emergency responders from the U.S. Coast Guard and Red
Cross involved.
Now if a Haitian texts 4636, a stranger on the other side of the world
will translate it and other volunteers (pictured right) will send it
to the right responder whether it's an urgent medical need or a
general request for more food and water. Volume has risen to about
2,500 messages a day since the Jan. 16 launch and messages are
translated and forwarded usually in between 2 and 10 minutes. They've
filtered through more than 20,000 texts so far.
In some cases, it's been life-saving. Earlier this week, a Haitian
woman went into labor and started bleeding out. She texted 4636,
calling for help. A translator and stranger pinpointed her location on
a map, giving the U.S. Coast Guard her coordinates. They were able to
reach her in time to help her deliver the baby.
The non-profits behind '4636' are now trying to scale it up as the
number of messages rises 10 percent a day. They're also trying to make
it more sustainable with larger pools of consistent volunteers.
"Honestly, this is rare to see groups like the State Department,
Ushahidi and Instedd all working together," Nesbit said. "I hope it
doesn't take another catastrophe to see this type of collaboration
again. The bright spot in all of this is seeing the tech community
take ownership."
True, but the more intriguing part of the story may be that this all
started with a simple tweet. In fact, Nesbit never set foot in Haiti.

Associated Press Writer
SCRANTON, Pa. (AP) - The nation's foreign exchange student programs need better federal oversight, the State
Department's internal watchdog concludes in a new report following a scandal in which students were placed in
shoddy homes in Pennsylvania.
Acting Inspector General Harold Geisel said in the report, released this week, the department's Bureau of
Educational and Cultural Affairs has largely abdicated its responsibility to ensure the well-being of thousands of
exchange students who come to the United States each year.
Instead, the sponsoring organizations themselves have been left to monitor their own programs and self-report
problems to federal regulators, the report said.
'There are insufficient dedicated resources at ECA to conduct effective oversight of youth exchange programs," the
report said.
The inspector general began its review in July, following allegations that an employee of a San Francisco-based
exchange program placed students in filthy homes around Scranton in northeastern Pennsylvania. Edna Burgette
was fired from Aspect Foundation after being charged in July with five felony counts of criminal negligence.
Aspect said it deplored Burgette's actions and had no prior knowledge of the neglect, but the agency was penalized
by the State Department.
"We're absolutely committed to strengthening our programs, making them the best they can be and ensuring that all
students have safe and rewarding experiences," Maura Pally, acting assistant secretary of state for educational and
cultural affairs, told The Associated Press on Friday.
In the wake of the Scranton case, the bureau added staff, established a separate unit to conduct site visits, e-mailed
current students to inquire about how their experiences are going, and set up a database to track problems, among
other fixes meant to improve oversight.
Also, proposed federal regulations would tighten requirements for host families and set up more rigorous
background checks.
"We acknowledge there were serious problems with our monitoring and oversight, and we agree with the IG's
assessment that things needed to change," Pally said. "The way things were operating was just not acceptable, and
we began making changes even before the report was released."

Report calls for more oversight of student exchange
programs

• Report: Establish requirements for criminal history checks of host families
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Youth exchange programs receiving U.S. State Department grants are suffering from.
insufficient oversight and attention from the federal government, according to an inspector general's report
released Thursday.

An inspector general's report calls for more oversight of student exchange programs.
The report calls for stronger monitoring of youth placement groups that receive federal grants to sponsor
exchange students. It finds that the department has been "relying instead on the coordinator to self-monitor."
Participants in the exchange programs are typically 15 to 18 and are among "the most vulnerable," according
to the report.
In 2008, the State Department gave 17 such, groups $39.4 million in taxpayer funds to manage programs
involving exchange students.
One of those groups, Aspect Foundation, received $1.08 million of those funds. However, Aspect came under
fire this year after students from Europe, Africa and South America -- whom the California-based foundation
had placed in Scranton, Pennsylvania -- came forward with allegations of mistreatment and abandonment.
CNN aired a detailed report on the case in July, after which the State Department said it would set up a toll-
free telephone number that foreign exchange students could use to report problems and tighten its oversight of
government-funded exchange student programs.
The inspector general's report notes that previous audits of the State Department's Bureau of Educational and
Cultural Affairs (ECA), which also found deficiencies in program oversight, found the department slow to make
changes.
"The incidents in Northeastern Pennsylvania were allowed to happen, in part, because of a lack of clear
regulations that allowed sponsor organizations to interpret the rules in a manner that ultimately endangered
these students," said Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pennsylvania, on Thursday.
In May, Casey pushed for an investigation into the Department of State's oversight of youth exchange
programs following reports out of Scranton.
One student was placed in a Scranton home with a person who had been convicted of a drug-related felony,
Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, District Attorney Andrew Jarbola has told CNN. Some students were so
malnourished that one was treated in a hospital for dehydration; another was put up in a home that was later
condemned by the city, he said.
The families that housed the students say the allegations are untrue. The Aspect Foundation first denied any
problems existed, then said it had corrected them and fired those responsible.
The State Department sanctioned Aspect by reducing the number of students it can bring over for the 2010-
2011 school year, a penalty that amounted to a loss of revenue of about $540,000, according to the
department.
"We at the Department of State recognize [because we] are responsible for this program we have to make
sure we are aggressively overseeing this program and make sure children are well-suited," said State
Department spokesman P.J. Crowley at the time.

The inspector general's report released Thursday does not specifically mention Aspect. It does review four
State Department programs, including Youth Exchange Study (YES) and the Future Leaders Exchange
(FLEX), both of which have given grants to the foundation.
The report calls on the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, which oversees the grant programs, to
establish requirements for criminal history checks of host families and put more resources into site visits at
placement groups.
"The Department of State has taken action to rectify its failure in the oversight and monitoring of exchange
programs," Casey said. "However, the real measure of progress will be what specific steps are taken to
prevent this problem from happening again."

How to Friday: How to build a crisis reporting system
Developers, technologists and volunteers around the world came together to build a crisis reporting
for Haiti. Here's how they did it

The Ushahidi crowdsourced crisis reporting in Haiti
Technologists around the world came together and rapidly built a system for Haitians to request help in the wake of
devastating earthquake. Using the internet to organise themselves, developers, communications experts and
humanitarian organisations created a system to gather emergency requests using text messages that won praise
from emergency officials and support from the US State Department.
Hours after the quake, Josh Nesbit, who heads up a non-profit using mobile phones to help deliver medical care in
Africa, heads sent this tweet:

Ushahidi is a crowd-sourced crisis reporting platform that was developed in Kenya to gather reports of violence in
the post-election unrest in 2008. Ushahidi, which means "testimony" in Swahili, has been used to gatherreports
about the swine flu outbreak, monitor elections in India and Mexico and to collect crime reports in Atlanta.
The platform can handle reports from a number of sources, via email, the web or via SMS, making it flexible and
very useful even in areas without intemet access. Ushahidi worked with teams in Kenya, Uganda and teams in
Boston and Washington DC in the United States.
Using Twitter, Josh got in contact with Jean-Marc Castera who was heading to the DigiCel command center,
according to Erik Hersman at Ushahidi. Working with the US State Department they were able to get the 4636 SMS
shortcode that had been used for weather information in Haiti. They launched the SMS-based emergency
information system with the support of the Thomson Reuters Foundation and technology disaster relief organisation
inSTEDD five da s after the suake.
Ten radio stations still operating in Haiti helped spread the word about the emergency shortcode. They also quickly
put up posters, and the US Department of State helped publicise it, announcing it via their official Twitter account
and elsewhere.
They worked with 10,000 Haitian volunteers to help translate the messages and other volunteers helped to structure
"mountains of data" coming into the system, Hersman wrote. The volunteers of Mission 4636 posted this on the
Ushahidi blog:
We are the volunteer translators of Mission 4636. We span six time zones and seven languages on any
given night. We are students, medics, stay at home mothers, archivists, firefighters, and software
developers. We are the quiet force behind Ushahidi Haiti & we give a voice to the lost.
San Francisco startups, Crowdflower and Samasource, which specialise in managing tasks for crowdsourcing,
helped organise the volunteer efforts, according to Kim-Mai Cutler at VentureBeat. She also reported that Katie
Stanton, an early Google employee who now works in the Office of Innovation at the State Department, "helped get
emergency responders from the U.S. Coast Guard and Red Cross involved".
Since is started, Ushahidi has received nearly 100,000 reports concerning Haiti, and organisers are working to
create a system, Swift River, to help filter those reports so that the most urgent ones get attention quickly.
One thing that is impressive about this effort is how distributed, collaborated and organised it is, and they have
blogged about how theykept this volunteer project focused. CrisisCamps to help with these projects sprung up in
cities around the world, including here in London.
A decade of crowdsourced crisis projects
Developers also created an application to help collect information on missing people in Haiti. After creating several
applications, they came to a decision to focus their efforts on a single app hosted at Google.
The Haiti Earthquake people finding application is actually the evolution of similar projects that started appearing
after the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US and rapidly developed after the Asian Tsunami in late
2004, Hurricane Katrina PeopleFinder project in 2005, the and the earthquake in Kashmir in 2005. The projects
gave rise to an XML format called the People Finder Interchange Format.
Every time a disaster like this happens, the response has gotten more sophisticated and better organised. The
response in Haiti by this volunteer army has been deeply impressive, and they have built up the expertise so that
when the next disaster happens, they'll have new tools to help speed aid to victims in need.

Brazil is 3 hours ahead of DC
And the 1000 [our time] turnover has not yet taken place
H/W report from our first-rate senior consular officer in Brazil and then some interesting backup [in two parts]
1300 Local Time [1000 EST] Report
I have just spoken with the Brazilian Central Authority regarding the orders imminently coming out of the office of the
President of the 2nd Regional Federal Court. He is evidently interpreting the lifting of the stay imposed at STF to mean
that the 48 hour period provided in the appellate court decision to the Brazilian family to turn over Sean to the
Consulate has started ticking again — not restarted at the beginning, but resumed ticking. According to the Court, the
deadline for turnover at the Consulate falls at 6am local time on Thursday morning, December 24. Because of the early
hour, he will evidently order the family to turn over Sean at the consulate NO LATER than 9am on Thursday, December
24. However, he will also recommend, not order, that the family turn over Sean at the Consulate today/tonight in order
to permit him to travel to the U.S. on an overnight flight and spend Christmas with the family in the U.S.
There is current debate ongoing regarding the timing of the turnover. Daniel Levy of the AGU office in Rio will evidently
take the lead in negotiating that turnover, in conjunction with David's legal team.
Press contacts are stating that Sergio Tostes, the attorney for the Brazilian family, has called a press conference at 2pm
local time (11am DC time) to announce voluntary turnover. No further details oh that yet.
Will pass more information as soon as we have it. Planning for all contingencies.
BACKGROUND
o Brazilian Central Authority reports that at lam local time today, the attorney for the Brazilian family contacted
Daniel Levy, the AGU attorney representing the Brazilian Govt in this case, to inform him that the Brazilian family
is willing to arrange for voluntary turnover of Sean at the Consulate General in Rio. Daniel Levy reportedly
replied that he would only facilitate these discussions on the condition that there were no further legal

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766618 Date: 08/31/2015
machinations to delay implementation of the court order, and that the turnover happened today. We do
not/not know what if any conditions the family will try to place on a voluntary handover, so planning for police
execution of the court order continues.
• Interpol office in Brasilia has assured BCA and the Embassy LEGAT that they are fully aware of the status of the
case and are ready to provide support if Sean is not turned over. They will have action if the family attempts to
hide Sean.
• We have contacted WHA Press and CA Press separately to discuss timing to release statements if/when we are
successful with wheels up.
• We have discussed detailed contingency plans should the police be called upon to go to the family residence to
enforce the order if voluntary handover does not occur. Also have plans in place to supplement personnel in Rio
should this extend past today.
• We have a general sense of the timing of potential events: We expect to have more clarity from the attorneys
as to whether or not voluntary handover will occur around noon/1pm local time, which is 9/10 DC time. Should
police enforcement be required, that will likely mean mid/late afternoon local time. We will advise asap if this
timeline shifts (as it is likely to do, this being Brazil.)
Background Report from Tuesday evening / last nite
PART I
• Tomorrow morning between 8-9, David Goldman's Brazilian attorney will go to the court to obtain the warrant
enforcing the return of Sean Goldman to the U.S. He will wait there pending coordination with relevant police
and judicial authorities to ensure that everything is ready, and they will depart for the family compound to take
custody of Sean.
• Consulate General Rio will have cars ready at 9am for transport, and the team will be ready at the airport to
facilitate departure.
• David's attorney has spoken to judicial authorities and believes that the motions filed at ST1 will not be accepted
by the court, so will not interfere with the return. This does not preclude some last minute legal maneuvers, but
he seems confident that the decision by STF will effectively cut off other avenues. We will advise asap if this
changes.
PART II
• The Brazilian Central Authority confirms that the office of Regional Federal Court President Paulo Espirito Santo
has received the decision of STF President Gilmar Mendes. It is Paulo E-S who will be responsible for enforcing
the decision from Mendes, i.e. the return of Sean Goldman to the U.S.
• BCA has promised to reinforce for Interpol the urgent necessity of police in Rio monitoring the location of Sean
Goldman. Embassy LEGAT office is double-tracking. We cannot, of course, ask them to enforce anything until
the proper judicial authority has sent them instructions, but we strongly urge them to be prepared.
• BCA has turned over operational jurisdiction to Daniel Levy, from the AGU's office in Rio, to coordinate with
David Goldman's attorney and with the court in Rio. I have asked David's attorney to try and get some
understanding from Mr. Levy as to the timeline we can expect to see in this case.
What remains unclear:
• We do not know if the judge from the Regional Federal Court intends to issue an execution order from his home
tonight at this late hour, or if he will wait until opening of business tomorrow morning. Note that 00B here
generally means 10am for a court. This only underscores the need to ensure that there is sufficient monitoring
of Sean's whereabouts.
• We do not know how Judge Paulo E-S will interpret an "immediate" return order — it could mean right this
instant, or it could mean some brief period of time where the family is ordered/encouraged to turn Sean over at
the Consulate or some other site.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766618 Date: 08/31/2015
• We are working to obtain some sense of whether this is likely to happen tonight, or if we are better served
getting some rest now and starting first thing 00B which for us means 7-8am.
• We have not had confirmation regarding the resolution of the motions in ST.I, but frankly, I don't foresee
receiving an answer on that before mid-day Wednesday.

I am seeking more information about this but want to let you know before the 5pm call that 10 Amcits were reportedly
arrested by Haitian police near the DR border with 33 Haitian children whom they reportedly planned to take to an
orphanage they are establishing in the DR. They are currently under arrest at a PAP police station or, according to one
report, at "the Justice Building near the airport." The whereabouts of the children is unknown.
The group is called the New Life Children Refuge America Organization (NLCR). Bill Bistransky found the attached "Plan
of Action"(P0A) on their web site when he googled that name. As he notes, either today's arrest is their second run
into Haiti to get children, or their original schedule is off.

Subject: (AP) Haiti PM: U.S. Baptists knew removing kids was wrong
PORT-AU-PRINCE (AP) - Haiti's prime minister says it's clear to him that the 10 U.S. Baptists who tried to take 33 Haitian
children out of the quake-ravaged country "knew what they were doing was wrong." Prime Minister Max Bellerive also
tells The Associated Press his country is open to having the Americans tried in the United States. Bellerive says some of
the children have parents who are alive. The government is attempting to locate them. He says a judicial system needs
to determine whether the Americans were acting in good faith, as they claim, or are child traffickers. The Americans are
mostly from Idaho. They have been held since being arrested January 29 trying to enter the Dominican Republic with the
children.

To rebuild Haiti, start with its young people A 700,000-strong national civic service corps would harness untapped labor
rapidly and instill national pride and confidence.
By Robert Muggah and Robert Maguire
January 31, 2010
Haiti will need big ideas to recover and rebuild in the aftermath of the devastating magnitude 7.0 earthquake this
month. The reported death toll has topped 150,000, and the reconstruction needs are incalculable. How about starting
with a 700,000-strong national civic service corps made up of Haitian youth? There are many reasons why such an entity
makes a lot of sense.
Haiti is a young country. An estimated 70% of the population is under 30; the 15-to-29 segment alone makes up 50% of
the population.
Demographers have long cautioned how excessively youthful populations can potentially exacerbate underdevelopment
and accentuate political instability.
Although Haiti registers among the lowest levels of education in the Western Hemisphere, Haitian youth are a wellspring
of creativity, talent and potential. You don't need to be a community-development specialist to know that they are
stifled by a lack of meaningful opportunities.
Fortunately, Haiti has an enabling environment to set up a civic service corps. Article 52 of the Haitian Constitution
commits citizens to national service, though it has never been activated. What is more, there are many Haitian and
international organizations mobilized and ready to help the government get this going.
A civic service corps would get the young and able out of the tent cities in and around Port-au-Prince and into work.
They could start with the once-iconic center of the capital, but also could begin planting trees, working the fields and
providing services in Haiti's countryside.
At a minimum, this would reverse generations of unfair stigmatizing of the youth there.
This plan would also harness untapped labor rapidly. Before the Jan. 12 earthquake, 50% of youth in their 20s were out
of work. Putting them in service toward rebuilding the capital and outlying areas would be a first step to restoring their
and their country's pride and dignity.
A civic service corps would also multiply international efforts to promote recovery after the world moves on to the next
crisis. Hundreds of humanitarian agencies, donor governments and nongovernmental organizations are facing
monumental challenges in coordinating relief assistance. Although everyone involved is committed to rapid
disbursement, transaction costs are monumental. A civic service corps would allow for a more rapid form of transferring
capital.

Direct support to such a corps would inject serious liquidity into the Haitian economy and stimulate recovery from the
bottom up. Rather than food-for-work schemes, international best practice recommends proposals that promote direct
monetary transfers to beneficiaries. Haitian youth and their families have urgent needs and don't need paternalistic
programs that curb their choices. With proper oversight and financial safeguards, a civic service corps would circumvent
unnecessary administrative costs.
Further, a civic service corps would restore national pride and confidence in Haitian public institutions. During past
decades, the state provided relatively few services to Haitians, particularly outside the capital. In some cases, state
entities were downright predatory. As a result, nonstate providers, including gangs and shady middlemen, filled the gap.
A civic service corps -- wearing the Haitian colors and acting as first responders or organizations demonstrating the
government's presence on the ground -- would show that the government is serious about supporting citizens. It would
be a symbolic first step toward renewing the social contract with the people.
A civic service corps also makes sense for long-term risk and emergency planning. Haiti is situated in the path of
hurricanes and on a fault line, and can expect more disasters. Training 700,000 young people -- especially young women
-- in the basics of first aid, emergency response, community policing and other skills would greatly mitigate the
consequences of future calamities. With disciplined training and management, the corps could provide more intensive
training in specialized areas -- engineering, telecommunications and public health.
An initial step to getting Haiti's youth to work could include the preparation of a road map for future meetings on Haiti,
including the U.N. donor conference scheduled for March. Any final plan would need to draw on the invaluable
experiences of ongoing efforts to mobilize youth in Haiti. These include the work of the Brazilian nongovernmental
organization Viva Rio and its supporters. Before the earthquake, Viva Rio and Brazilian peacekeepers had recruited and
trained hundreds of Haitian youth, including former gang members, to provide relief services in Haiti's slums. This
program could be reactivated and scaled up quickly.
A civic service corps could draw on the lessons from such groups to target and recruit youths for, say, up to two years.
The Haitian government would, of course, need to be the one to manage the undertaking, with direct oversight from the
president's office and the Interior Ministry.
And there are many countries that could provide advice and support.
Nongovernmental groups and private donors could also play a key role in mobilizing support and transferring essential
skills.
Haiti's youth are the future of the nation, and they are central to Haiti's recovery. A civic service corps is a large-scale
way to quickly mobilize them to act as catalyst for long-term, progressive changes.

the SecDev Group and is currently advising multilateral and bilateral organizations on Haiti's recovery. Robert Maguire is

UNITED NATIONS - (AP) Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says UNICEF chief Ann Veneman will not seek a second
term. Ban expressed "great regret" Veneman was stepping down and praised her "immense dedication ... and
determination to improve children's health, education and well-being." Before being appointed to head UNICEF in
2005, Veneman was the first female U.S. secretary of agriculture in the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush.
Her term ends April 30, 2010. In a letter to friends and colleagues, Veneman said she was stepping down with "a
heavy heart," but gave no reason for her decision.

Subject: FW: END OF THE GOLDMAN CASE
I thought I would share this heartfelt message from Patricia Lamego de Teixeira Soares, the head of Brazil's Central
Authority, the office responsible for Hague Convention abduction cases. You will see that in spite of our efforts to
protect the son, the Brazilian family chose to make a spectacle outside the Consulate this morning by parading Sean
through a crowd. Ms. Lamego recently visited the U.S. where she met with members of Congress and others to explain
all that the Brazilian Central Authority was doing to reunite Sean and his father under the Hague Convention. The
delays we saw in this case were largely the result of a wealthy, well connected family able to influence court decisions.
We are all relieved and thrilled to see this long overdue but very happy ending. I should also highlight the amazing
work done by US Mission Brazil. The consular staff, Charge, Acting DCM (Marie Damour, the Consul General in Brasilia),
LegATT, RSO, and a host of others all played a role in this successful return. My OCS DAS, Michele Bond, and her
dedicated team also played a big role in communicating with David, his lawyers, Congress, and the press. We had
Members of Congress, former Assistant Secretaries and US Ambassadors all pitching in. While there were
disagreements at times over tactics, we all agreed that we were working towards the same goal: the safe return of
Sean.
We particularly appreciate the strong support from the Secretary. Many people will try to take credit for today's happy
reunion but it was the Secretary's continued concern and interest in this case that made the difference. We could not
have provided a better gift to David Goldman during this season of giving. Janice

Dear All,
The Goldman case finally came to an end, and despite the efforts of all involved the hand over of the child to the US
Consulate in Rio was transformed into a deplorable display of the child walking in the streets with the maternal family,
being exposed to the media and to the public that surrounded the consulate.
I'm sorry this had to happen but it seems that Mr. Sergio Tostes, the matemal family's attorney, did not feel at all
embarrased to use and expose the child, who was probably under severe stress, in order to gather support for his
position. This most despicable man is not accepting the fact that, despite his life long relationships with influential
authorities in Brazil, he was unable to win the case and Sean is finally being reunited with his only real father.
(just hope that David and the Goldman family find enough time to recover their lives and their relationship with Sean.
They need time more than anything else and now it is up to the US government to guarantee that David Goldman will not
have to face the maternal family once again in the US courts where, according to Mr. Tostes last declaration to the
Brazilian press, he will "fight to defend the child".
Please allow David Goldman to live in peace with his son and have the life that he deserves after fighting so much for so
many years.
In my name and in the name of all the staff of the Brazilian Central Authority I wish David, Sean, and their family all the
best and a most happy life once they are finally back in the United States.
And to all of you who worked so much in support of this case, our deepest gratitude. We wish you all a Merry Christmas
and a very Happy New Year.

Jack—
Thanks for flagging this. We actually saw this last night, and Vikram and I had a conversation with Richard about it. The
report was based on interviews conducted in May-June, before the new policy change was implemented, so much of the
report is already OBE. OIG gave us the draft report in October, and SRAP/SCA/INL immediately sent a joint response to
OIG (attached), highlighting that we were already working on many of the issues highlighted in the report.
Given the change in policy and our letter to them, we found it pretty egregious that the OIG didn't report on the changes
underway or adjustments already made, as the report is being portrayed in the press as currently applicable. Michael
Keays on the Afghan desk and Peggy, who both help to oversee CN issues, are already working on a letter to OIG
expressing our strong concern about the report and the process which got us to this point, and Vikram and his team are
ginning up press points which also note that we have already begun to robustly address many of these points (I've cc'ed
them all on this).
If you'd like to talk further, I'm happy to come up to your office at some point this morning to discuss.

Subject FYI - Raj Shah Background
Rajiv Shah
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Current Under Secretary Rajiv Shah
Rajiv "Raj" Shah (born March 9, 1973) is presently Under Secretary of Agriculture for Research, Education,
and Economics (REE) and Chief Scientist at the United States Department of Agriculture.
Prior to his appointment at USDA, Shah worked in a range of leadership roles at the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation including Director of Agricultural Development, Director of Financial Services, leader of the
Strategic Opportunities initiative and manager of the Foundation's $1.5 billion commitment to the Vaccine
Fund. He also came up with the idea for the International Finance Facility for Immunization to transform the
global system of vaccine financing, and worked to secure donor commitments of more than $5 billion for this
facility. Before joining the Gates Foundation, Shah was a health care policy advisor on the Al Gore presidential
campaign, 2000 and a member of Governor Ed Rendell's (D-PA) transition committee on health.
Shah earned his M.D. from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and M.Sc. in Health Economics
at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He is a graduate of the University of Michigan and
also attended the London School of Economics.
President Obama announced Shah's selection as Under Secretary of Research, Education, and Economics and
Chief Scientist on April 17, 2009. Shah's nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate by unanimous
consent on May 12, 2009.
Early life and family
Born to Indian immigrant parents who settled in Ann Arbor, Michigan in the late 60's, Raj Shah grew up in the
Detroit area and attended Wylie Groves High School.
He lives with his wife, Shivam, and their two young children, Sajan and Amna. He has one sister, Ami Shah,
who is a medical doctor.

Prior to his appointment at USDA Raj worked in a range of leadership roles at the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation to help the poorest people on earth lead healthy and productive lives.
As the Director of the Agricultural Development program, Shah oversaw the foundation's multi-billion dollar
portfolio of grant and program-related investments to help transform rural economies throughout the developing
world and help small farmers and their families overcome hunger and poverty. He led efforts to create the
Alliancefor a Green Revolution in Africa, helped recruit its leadership including UN Secretary General Kofi
Annan, and serves on its Board of Directors. He oversaw grant portfolios in science and technology; farmer
productivity; market access; and policy, statistics and advocacy; and managed a team of more than 60
professionals. He also developed innovative partnerships with private industry, the United Nations, the World
Bank, and country governments around the world, where he was an active voice on issues related to food and
hunger.
As the Foundation's first Director for the Financial Services to the Poor portfolio, Shah worked with a broad
range of financial institutions and other donors to determine how Foundation resources could best amplify the
field's collective impact. Previously, he led the Strategic Opportunities initiative which worked with Foundation
co-chairs to identify, assess and recommend new areas of giving. This process led to the creation of the
Foundation's Global Development Program.
Shah's early work with the Foundation focused on global health. As Deputy Director for Policy and Finance,
Raj managed the Foundation's $1.5 billion commitment to the Vaccine Fund — an effort referred to by Bill and
Melinda Gates as their best investment. He also came up with the idea for the International Finance Facility for
Immunization to transform the global system of vaccine financing and worked to secure donor commitments of
more than $5 billion for this facility. The World Health Organization estimates this initiative will save more
than five million children's lives through the next decade, and a New York Times article described the effort as
"a clever way to reduce the burden of costly diseases now and save money in the future."
Shah previously worked as a health care policy advisor on the Gore 2000 presidential campaign, was an active
supporter of the Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008, and served as a member of Pennsylvania Governor
Ed Rendell's health transition committee. He also co-founded Health Systems Analytics (a health care
consulting firm), served as an advisor to the City of Philadelphia's Public Health Commissioner, and worked at
the World Health Organization. In addition, he co-founded multiple nonprofit organizations focused on
increasing the political awareness and civic engagement of minority communities, including Project Impact for
South Asian Americans.

Cheryl:
My blackberry is down so I'm sending you a quick note from Uganda via Ambassador Jerry Lanier's account.
I met this morning with President Museveni in Entebbe. I raised with him the issue of the draconian legislation
proposed to criminalize homosexual activity. Museveni was unaware of the legislation but thought it was excessive and
out of order. He said he would work with members of Parliament to revise the legislation to make it a crime for adults
to solicit or recruit minors into any homo- or heterosexual activities. Activities between consenting adults would be
stripped from the legislation. I think we rolled the worst and most concerning part of this back.

Dear Cheryl,
I want you to know that last month a friend of mine convinced me to apply for a fellowship at Harvard/Institute of
Politics, and I did. A few days ago, I got a call from the Program Director who informed me that I was accepted. I am very
excited about it and think it will be a very good opportunity to share my experience with students who
are learning theories about democracy and development.
Cheryl, I am going to be bold and ask you if you would accept my invitation to come and speak to the students while I
am there. I am asked and encouraged to invite important personalities who can talk of their experience in government
and I thought of you. I would be thrilled if you accept. I will be there from end of January until the beginning of May next
year. I have also invited President Moreno of IDB who accepted and I am waiting for an answer from Michaelle Jean, the
General Governor of Canada.
I wish you the very best, to you and your family for Christmas and the New Year. I hope our roads cross again as we
thrive to better the lives of so many people who deserve it. Please extend my wished to the Secretary of State. I admire
her and her work.
Warm regards,

I would encourage you to take note of this Newsweek interview posted today in which US Global AIDS

Ambassador Goosby, according to Newsweek, says that he does not have a dog in the fight as to whether
Uganda criminalizes or even adopts the death penalty for homosexuality. ..Goosby.s interview appears to
undercut the pressure the Congress, the Secretary of State and human rights supporters around the world have
put on the Ugandan government in recent days to save the LGBT population in that country from violent
persecution.. The LGBT worldwide community must push back against any leader, including Goosby if the
Newsweek report is accurate, who looks the other way as Uganda enacts a draconian law to imprison or even
execute its LGBT citizens.

Eric Goosby: No Hold on PEPFAR Funds for Uganda
Katie Paul
Stigma is anathema to effective public-health work, but that's never stopped homophobic crusaders from
mucking up the fight against HIV/AIDS before. Now, just as the South African government is finally changing
its tune on the matter, Uganda is emerging as the world's new problem country. The recipient of $287 million in
PEPFAR funds last year, Uganda is also the site of a vicious campaign against homosexuality, which took a
turn for the worse last month when the "Anti-Homosexuality Bill" was introduced to Parliament. The bill
threatens harsher punishments for actual or even perceived homosexual activity, which is already illegal under
Ugandan law; convicted offenders could face the death penalty. "Promoting homosexuality" would also be
illegal, as would a failure to report any of the above to police within 24 hours.
Even by regional standards, such penalties would be exceptionally harsh, especially since they would
effectively criminalize the work of HIV/AIDS prevention efforts under the "promotion of homosexuality
clause." The thinking behind them is just as disturbing, since this latest round of antigay fervor was kicked off
at a conference held by by American missionary groups that went to proselytize about the twin evils of Nazism
and homosexual behavior in Kampala earlier this year. Just to hammer home how far-out that is, this means the
Ugandan government got its advice from the author of a book called The Pink Swastika: Homosexuality in the
Nazi Party, which claims the Nazi movement was "entirely controlled by militaristic male homosexuals
throughout its short history." The result has been a vigilante campaign against the country's LGBT community,
whereby gay detainees are tortured and tabloids publish the names, places of employment, addresses, and
physical descriptions of gay-rights advocates under headlines that scream "TOP HOMOS IN UGANDA
NAMED." It would seem the stuff of Orwellian parody, but it's real.
As the witchhunt in Kampala has heated up, so too have calls for U.S. policymakers to take a stand. In an article
for the Los Angeles Times, TNR editor James Kirchick called for PEPFAR to withhold its funding for
HIV/AIDS programming in Uganda unless its legislators abandon the legislation, which has been tabled for
now. But in an interview with NEWSWEEK this week, PEPFAR chief Eric Goosby said he didn't have a dog in
that fight:
I'm very concerned about any decision that any country#ncluding our own.would make to target a group
that's in the population, and that's always been in the population, by excluding them from a service or passes
legislation that criminalizes their behavior. Every time you do that, you push the behavior underground. It
never works. Rather than minimizing the spread of the virus, it actually amplifies it.
The U.S. policy is trying to work with governments to say exactly that. I think I would do more harm than good
by connecting our resources to respond to the epidemic to making them dependent on a behavior that they're
not willing to engage in on their own. My role is to be supportive and helpful to the patients who need these
services. It is not to tell a country how to put forward their legislation. But I will engage them in conversation
around my concern and knowledge of what this is going to do to that population, and our ability to stop the
movement of the virus into the general population.
So, for all those who hoped that PEPFAR funding might be used as a hammer to pressure the Ugandan powers-
that-be to abandon their crusade: no dice. The Obama era is the dialogue era; don't pick fights, but persuade
through elegant theses. That said, since the moral argument clearly hasn't convinced the Ugandan authorities of
the errors of their ways, one can only hope that Goosby's public-health argument will.

Madame Secretary:
Per our earlier conversation and within the boundaries of unclassified email, there are three objectives we can achieve
regarding the country we
discussed:
1)Enable broad communication between resistance organizers and participants without significantly increasing risk for
individuals;
2)Circumventing government-imposed firewalls that expediently enable individuals to transmit text, image and video
documentation of what is happening on the ground; and
3) Identify and make viral symbolic content that will move global opinion.
All of my and Jared's ideas which you saw reflected in the memo from last week are executable from anywhere between
24 hours to a couple months.
There are not any technological barriers to execution, but as I discussed with Jake, some take us well past the
boundaries of what has been allowable to date in our current policy framework.
That said, we are ready and willing to take action as soon we have a "go" order. I am happy to review specific content
from the memo with you or others offline.
Separately, I wanted to share some key activities following up on your Internet Freedom speech, which has reverberated
globally. Here is what we are doing to maintain forward momentum:
1)With your blessing, we will build a new architecture of States who share our principles of Internet freedom and are
committed to not just espousing those principles, but collaborating in measurably reducing the number of States that
countervail the freedoms you outlined in your speech.
2)Jared and I met with Stanford President John Hennessy last week and we will work through Stanford to indirectly
launch an innovation competition for the best apps and programs that provide tools for circumvention of politically
motivated censorship.
3) Maria Otero and Bob Hormats will co-chair a session in which we are hauling in the major, relevant technology
companies. There may be some squealing, but we want to ensure that the private sector understands our values and
make more carefully considered decisions about the deals they cut with foreign governments. In these meetings, we will
also look for the private sector to contribute resources (financial, engineering, hardware, etc.) in support of your

Internet Freedom objectives. Finally, we intend to build an industry-led coalition with a set of standards that have real
teeth and accountability.
4) We will be deploying our Civil Society 2.0 team to work with local stakeholders in key environments on capacity
building that will enhance their ability to address the key issues you articulated in your Internet freedom speech.
There are other activities which I can detail separately and will review with Cheryl and Jake.
My best,
Alec

I want you to know that last month a friend of mine convinced me to apply for a fellowship at Harvard/Institute of
Politics, and I did. A few days ago, I got a call from the Program Director who informed me that I was accepted. I am very
excited about it and think it will be a very good opportunity to share my experience With students who
are learning theories about democracy and development.
Cheryl, I am going to be bold and ask you if you would accept my invitation to come and speak to the students while I
am there. I am asked and encouraged to invite important personalities who can talk of their experience in government
and I thought of you. I would be thrilled if you accept. I will be there from end of January until the beginning of May next
year. I have also invited President Moreno of IDB who accepted and I am waiting for an answer from Michaelle Jean, the
General Governor of Canada.
I wish you the very best, to you and your family for Christmas and the New Year. I hope our roads cross again as we
thrive to better the lives of so many people who deserve it. Please extend my wished to the Secretary of State. I admire
her and her work.

STATEMENT FROM CECILE RICHARDS ON INTERNATIONAL
FAMILY PLANNING IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION BUDGET
WASHINGTON, DC —The women of the world have true friends in Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton
and the Obama administration. After years of inadequate funding during the previous administration,
yesterday's Fiscal Year 2011 budget request for an increase in international family planning is a critical step
forward in demonstrating our nation's renewed commitment to ensuring that women worldwide have access to
safe and effective reproductive health care.
The Obama administration has sent a strong signal that the status quo is unacceptable. Every year more than
half a million women — nearly all of whom live in developing countries — die of pregnancy-related causes.
Moreover, one in three deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth could be avoided if women who wanted
effective contraception had access to it.
To strengthen our working relationships with partners around the world, as well as our image, the United
States must increase access to family planning. By ensuring that women have increased access to the family
planning they need, our nation is working to make good on its commitment to promote the health of all women
and their families.
An investment in family planning is an investment that reaps significant dividends. By providing education,
counseling and contraceptives to women and couples, we are working to strengthen families worldwide. We
also will help achieve major reductions in infant and maternal mortality, HIV infections and global poverty. As
Secretary Clinton has said, "There's a direct connection between a woman's ability to plan her family, space
her pregnancies, and give birth safely, and her ability to get an education, work outside the home, support her
family, and participate fully in the life of her community."

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766945 Date: 08/31/2015
Planned Parenthood works with partners across the globe to eliminate barriers to basic reproductive health
care that is essential to the health and well-being of women, men and children everywhere. Limited access to
health care, lack of political will, legal and regulatory restrictions, cultural taboos, and harsh gender inequality
all put women at risk of unintended pregnancy, unsafe abortion and childbirth, and HIV and other sexually
transmitted infections. The commitment of Secretary Clinton and the Obama administration to international
family planning will further the efforts of Planned Parenthood and others to help women overcome barriers to
accessing needed reproductive health care.
As the Fiscal Year 2011 budget and appropriations process moves forward, we look forward to working with
Congress to build on this request so that we may adequately address the global health challenges facing
women worldwide.

BRASILIA, February 3, 2010 (AFP) - A foreign ministers' meeting between
Brazil and the European Union in Madrid later this month is to discuss

Cheryl:
Thank you very much for your note. I am enormously grateful for the tremendous support that you and the Secretary
offered me during this confirmation gauntlet. Without that support I have no doubt that I would still be stuck in
confirmation limbo.
I am now looking forward to getting to Brasilia and getting to work.
I hope you and your family had a great Christmas. I am wishing you a happy and prosperous new year.

Re: Redesign of State.gov Accomplishments and Changes
On Thursday, December 17, 2009 the Department launched a new homepage design and altered navigation
functionality for www.state.gov,the public facing site of the State Department.
The site aimed to meet the following goals:
• Better highlight the Department's priorities
• Proactively engage visitors
• Develop more Search-friendly features
• Provide easy access to vital citizen services, e.g. passport and visa information
The launch brought a series of positive press as noted in the below clips:
"..it embraces social networking and other Web 2.0 tools in an exercise it called "21st Century statecraft." — AFP
Global
"Gone are the old pro forma website verticals like press information, career postings, and resources for kids and other
young one. Now, State.gov's site navigation draws attention to the ambitious policy thrusts that Secretary Clinton
would like to make the centerpieces of her tenure at the department." — TechPresident
"The State Department hopes to use the site to engage people in an ongoing dialogue on foreign policy" -- Federal
Computer Week
"The U.S. Department of State today unveiled a redesign of its official website, incorporating improved functionality
and an updated design. With significant increases in traffic and expanding needs among users, the new, simplified
design of www.state.gov aims to: present the Department of State more transparently, effectively communicate the

Secretary Clinton and others in the Department on the foreign policy issues facing the country." — Enews Channel
Results:
Overall the site has received positive praise from inside and outside the building on the new simplified design. The
increased focus on major foreign policy objectives and on social networking have altered traffic and increased our
networks. The new design allows us to better educate visiting audiences on the priorities of the Department and better
engage in a daily conversation.
All metrics are trending up for visiting audiences to state.gov, Dipnote the blog, and social networking.
Top Line Statistics:
State.gov: 37% increase in traffic
Dipnote Blog: 30% increase to traffic
Facebook: 20% increase to number of fans
Twitter: 23% increase to number of followers
Search: -3% indicating that users perhaps are better at finding information and have less of a need for search function.
We will continue to monitor.
Going forward:
We will continue to monitor all our metrics to ensure we are expanding our reach and engagement. We will look in the
coming year to continue refining the website to build upon initial successes to ensure information is easy to find,
understandable and useable. We will also look to build more language support into State.gov, and increase the number
of social networking tools we are using to engage visiting audiences.
Also given the increased importance on interagency priorities like Global Health and Food Security, we will seek ways
that we can work together across agencies to promote our agenda and educate each of our visiting audiences on
priorities through www.state.gov.

The Post's Dec 27 editorial ("Redefining Human Rights") on the Obama Administration's human rights and democracy
policies, and Secretary Clinton's recent speech at Georgetown in particular, misses THE CRITICAL
POINT: human rights, democracy, and development are mutually reinforcing, not competing goals. They complement
each other in the [DELETE: practical] task of making human rights a human reality.
President Roosevelt understood the fundamental link between liberty, prosperity and security, tying together freedom
of speech and worship with freedom from want and freedom from fear in his famous "Four Freedoms"
speech. At Georgetown, Secretary Clinton articulated a 21st century vision grounded in this [DELETE: old] wisdom.
To accuse Secretary Clinton of embracing a Soviet-bloc approach to human rights because she includes development in a
discussion of democracy not only strains the bonds of credulity and common sense, it also walls off a crucial avenue for
ensuring that people can actually exercise the rights that are naturally theirs - including the rights to freedom of religion,
association, and speech-in their daily lives.
AS SECRETARY CLINTON MADE CLEAR, policies that address development alone are not adequate: "Freedom doesn't
come in half measures, and partial remedies will not solve the whole problem," she said. But experience shows us that
where broad-based development occurs, people are more likely to demand a say in securing their futures, and
governments are more likely to have the resources to maintain the strong institutions, including reliable police and fair
courts, that help ensure the consistent protection of rights. Where people are given the right to speak freely, to
participate in their nation's political process and have access to basic information about government, sustainable
development is [DELETE: much] more likely to occur. At the same time, democracies without development do not last.
These are mutually reinforcing tracks, and the Obama Administration is committed to pursuing both simultaneously.
As President Obama said in his Nobel lecure, "engagement with repressive regimes lacks the satisfying purity of
indignation." But the Post's overheated outrage ignores the [DELETE: practical] lessons learned by generations of men
and women who worked to advance human rights around the world.
[DELETE: And t]To suggest that Secretary Clinton somehow provided excuses to rights-abusing dictators in a speech in

Haitian activists want Obama to address immigration
goals
With President Barack Obama coming to Miami, some Haitian-American activists want
him to address the issue of Temporary Protected Status.
BY LESLEY CLARK AND JACQUELINE CHARLES
LCLARK@MIAMIHERALD.COM
WASHINGTON -- Haitian-American and immigrant activists who greeted President Barack Obama's election with
high hopes are growing frustrated with the administration's failure to deliver one of their top goals.
Obama said in July he was "very sympathetic" to the community's request to allow Haitian immigrants now illegally
in the country to stay temporarily, but no decision has been announced. Some activists say their patience is wearing
thin.
"I feel they are stringing us along, and we are in an awkward position," said Randolph McGrorty, head of Catholic
Charities Legal Services, who brought the subject to a head with a stinging e-mail sent to House, Senate and
administration staffers last week. "Do we allow them to string us along because they are our allies or do we start
calling them on the carpet for it?"
The unrest comes as Obama plans a trip to Miami on Monday to raise money for House and Senate Democrats.
Presidential candidate Obama did not promise to grant undocumented Haitian immigrants temporary legal status in
the United States -- a designation known as Temporary Protected Status, or TPS -- but activists said they believed
the first African-American president would give the issue special consideration.
Instead, former President Bill Clinton -- a United Nations special envoy to the country -- and the United Nations have
taken the lead in rebuilding a storm-battered Haiti after last year's four back-to-back storms that killed hundreds and
left nearly $1 billion in damages.
CHALLENGE
The issue of TPS poses a challenge for Rep. Kendrick Meek, a Miami Democrat who is depending on a robust
tumout in the politically active Haitian-American community to boost his Senate bid. But critics say South Florida's
congressional Democrats, including Meek, have not been as vocal about pushing the Obama administration on Haiti
as they were during the Bush administration.
Meek, who represents the largest group of Haitian-American voters in the United States, said Friday he's had
meetings with the administration and is optimistic that it is taking a serious look at the policy.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767000 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767000 Date: 07/31/2015
It may not come as soon as we want to, but I can tell you the Obama administration has made steps the Bush
administration wouldn't have made in 100 years," Meek said, noting that the administration has temporarily stayed
deportations of noncriminals to Haiti. "The ultimate goal is to have Haiti in a position where Haitians can stay in
Haiti and not take to the sea."
Still, Broward Democrat Rep. Alcee Hastings chastised the administration last week, looking to prod it by attaching
an amendment to a Coast Guard spending bill that would require the agency to review the effect of changing
immigration policy toward Haiti. Critics have suggested TPS could lead Haitians to rush to the U.S. shore.
"Temporary Protected Status or some other comparable relief for our Haitian neighbors is long overdue and this
administration has been stalling for far too long," Hastings said in support of his amendment.
He said the review would "hopefully help us show that our government has rationally and realistically examined all
possible scenarios and we are well-equipped to contend with any possible effects."
U.S. POLICY
When Obama brought up the issue in July, he said the administration is reviewing U.S. policy on deporting
undocumented Haitians, suggesting that the issue would be "part of a broader conversation about immigration."
But immigration groups say the pace on overhauling the nation's immigration system is too slow and fear no
progress next year during a volatile election.
The White House this week referred questions on TPS to the Department of Homeland Security, which said it had
made no changes in policy, adding that, "no one should attempt to come to the U.S. in the hopes of being granted
TPS.
Advocates for Haitian Americans, including Cheryl Little, executive director of the Florida Immigrant Advocacy
Center, said they've written a number of letters and e-mails to the administration seeking a response to their request
for TPS -- and in recent months have offered less-sweeping alternatives to TPS to help the estimated 35,000
undocumented Haitians currently living in legal limbo.
"Washington needs to know we are not going to fade into the woodwork," Little said. "We are going to continue to
make the case for TPS and be critical of this administration when they don't do the right thing."
ADVOCATE
Earlier this month, Little appealed to former President Clinton who, during two appearances in Miami recently, spoke
of his support for TPS. He said if the decision was up to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, "it would have been
done. Hillary strongly supports this."
A spokesman for the State Department declined to comment on Clinton's remarks, saying they were the former
president's "personal comments" and it would be "inappropriate for us to make any official declarations on the
issue" since the decisions are being made by Homeland Security.
Advocates acknowledge the administration has quietly made some changes. It has temporarily suspended the
deportation of noncriminal, undocumented Haitians. Undocumented Haitians with no criminal records who are
detained by immigration authorities are being released from detention centers as long as they agree to a final order
of removal.
Once released, they can apply for work permits but must periodically check in with immigration authorities until they
are eventually deported.
'BABY STEPS'

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767000 Date: 07/31/2015
But critics dismiss the changes as "baby steps," noting that by not granting undetained migrants a chance to apply
for work permits, they're unable to support themselves or assist struggling families back home. An impoverished
Haiti is dependent on remittances from abroad.
"That is not nearly enough," Little said. "That is not even a half-hearted attempt at doing the right thing here."
The Haitian-American Grassroots Coalition met Wednesday to discuss the issue and plans to protest at Obama's
fundraiser in Miami on Monday. Haitian activists protested outside the White House last month.
"As far as we are concerned, regarding Haiti, the Obama administration is maintaining the same status quo as the
Bush immigration policy," said Jean-Robert Lafortune, the coalition's president.

Kerry: "No plans" to go to Iran
Yesterday, Iranian media reported comments from the Iranian foreign ministry spokesman that the Iranian
parliament was considering an alleged request filed by Sen. John Kerry (D-MA) to travel to Iran.
Today, Fred Jones, spokesman for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told POLITICO that "John Kerry
has no plans to visit Iran."
Jones added that "We never discuss the Senator's private or diplomatic conversations."
Asked if that implied that Kerry was exploring the possibility of meeting Iranian officials elsewhere in a third
country, Jones said. no. "There are no plans to meet with any Iranian officials abroad."
Interestingly, for the past week, Kerry's office has used variations of "unaware of plans" or "no plans" to discuss
these Iran meetings rumors -- rather than "no."
And at face value, Jones' statement today does not seem to be the kind of flat denial that Kerry had filed such a
request, but doesn't seem to indicate such a meeting is imminent. It also does not seem to close the door that
such plans have been or are being or will be explored.
Has occurred to me that having a non administration lawmaker showing willingness to keep a channel open
with Tehran could serve several purposes, in that it's not the administration offering to send an envoy. It could
also distract a lot of attention away as a kind of decoy from other conversations that might or might not be
going on.

Subject: CNN piece on what's happening now in tech space in Tehran
http://edition.cnn.com/2009/TECH/12/30/iran.social.media/
(CNN) — It was called the "Twitter Revolution" — the mass street protests following Iran's questionable June elections that were
beamed to the world via social media and other online tools despite the government's media blackout.
This week, a loose, multi-national network of protesters, bloggers, Web developers and everyday Internet users has ramped up
again in the wake of renewed anti-government street demonstrations that turned deadly Sunday on Ashura, a Shiite Muslim holy
day commemorating the death of 7th Century cleric Imam Hussein.
This time, Internet analysists and online activists involved in the movement have told CNN that a government initially caught flat-
footed at how easily information flowed out of the country was ready to fight back.
"It's clear the government has been definitely restricting the Internet in a much more controlled way," said Cyrus Farivar, an
Iranian-American freelance journalist who writes about technology issues. "They're definitely paying attention and, at the very
least, trying to intimidate people."
And retaliation has been brutal — both for those taking to the streets and those spreading the word online.
One of the most compelling videos to emerge from the recent unrest showed what the people who posted it said was an Iranian
government vehicle plowing into a crowd of protesters, apparently running over and, they say, killing a woman.
Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi, Tehran's chief prosecutor, said Tuesday that seven people were killed in the Ashura riots. The
demonstrations were the deadliest since June. Those left at least eight dead, according to Iran's Supreme National Security
Council — although dissidents and observers have said there were many more.
The world was able to learn about those protests through first-person accounts online after a disputed election that returned
hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to office despite serious questions about polling results.
As protests swelled, Iran's government began kicking out some reporters from some traditional Western media outlets, arresting
others and restricting the movements of those who remained.
In their place sprung citizen journalists who posted videos, photos and firsthand accounts on Twitter feeds, Facebook groups
and sites like Flickr and YouTube. They kept images of the protests -- and the sometimes bloody response of government
backers — in front of the world.
As early as election day, both opposition political leaders and anti-government protesters said cell-phone signals were being
jammed. They consistently reported networking Web sites in Iran being blocked, phone lines disconnected and protest sites
allegedly infiltrated by government spies who spread misinformation and sought the identities of those speaking against the
regime.
That experience, observers say, had the government primed for the most recent explosion of information.
"The spike at the beginning, right after the election, was pretty chaotic,"said Austin Heap, a San Francisco-based Web
developer who has helped Iranian dissidents report from within their country. "Not even their government knew what they were
going to do and how they were going to handle things.

"I think right now what you're seeing is a much more coordinated and organized response from them."
Tech experts say the Iranian government has become more adept at using a type of Internet filtering called deep-packet
inspection to track information sent from one Internet user to another and hunt down the sender.
The government has also begun using the protest's own techniques against it. As early as June, online activists said they
suspected government agents of posing as protesters in an attempt to pry information out of people within the movement. Some
Twitter feeds of protesters suddenly and inexplicably began posting pro-government messages or asking for details about where
and when protests would be held.
Earlier this month, videos that appeared to show protesters burning an image of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
circulated the Internet. Opposition leaders denied the burnings ever happened and said they were a hoax carried out by the
government to discredit them and turn the Iranian public against their cause.
"Fake clips, usually made to provoke and split the opposition, are becoming a staple of the Iranian Internet," Evgeny Morozov,
who writes about the Internet for Foreign Policy magazine, wrote in a commentary for CNN.
Austin Heap has helped set up and verify reliable proxies by which Iranians can post news to the Web without giving away their
locations. He's also helping develop a program called Haystack designed to help Iranians anonymously elude government filters.
'We definitely have been working on overload for the past three days," he said Tuesday. "I woke up two days ago to 60 e-mails
and 12 missed phone calls — all people that, all of a sudden, needed an immediate response."
The continued media blackout in Iran had made it difficult for traditional media to immediately verify Sunday's accounts of the
weekend's violence. But videos that surfaced depicted bloodied and, in some cases, apparently dead protesters.
A range of Web sites have either emerged or seen renewed interest in light of the recent protests. They run the gamut from
YouTube accounts dedicated to images from street protests to blogs mocking the Iranian regime.
At the blog Watch Me Confess, opponents of Iran's government post faux apologies for what they call ridiculous claims the
government has made about the protesters.
At Neda Net -- named for the young woman whose shooting death in June became a rallying cry for protesters -- people who
call themselves a network of hackers offer tips on how to help Iranians use the Internet freely
"There's this kind of global attention being paid across different countries and cultures and languages," said Farivar, who noted
the emergence of a Twitter hashtag — #CN4Iran -- THAT appears to have been started by Chinese supporters of the Iranian
protesters.
Despite their best efforts and good intentions, supporters outside the country won't decide the outcome of the most recent round
of protests, Farivar said. The actions of Iranians on the ground will.
"I think it's naive to think that just because you're changing your location to Tehran [on a Twitter profile] that you're confusing the
Iranian authorities," he said. "That would make them seem less intelligent than they are."
But Heap said the steady flow of information will be important as a government that prefers secrecy continues a violent
crackdown on its citizens.
"They can't hide any more," he said. 'The government has done everything they can to shut people up, and every time they do
this they're just making more and more activists -- more and more citizen journalists."

Clinton edges Palin for most admired
By: Andy Barr
December 30, 2009 08:48 AM EST
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is the most admired woman in America, barely edging
out former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, according to a Gallup poll out Wednesday.
When Gallup asked 1,025 adults nationwide to name the woman they admire most, 16
percent picked Clinton. Palin was the only other woman to be mentioned by at least 10
percent, being selected by 15 percent of those surveyed.
Daytime talk show host Oprah Winfrey came in third with 8 percent, edging out first lady
Michelle Obama who got 7 percent.
Rounding out the top 10 were former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Queen
Elizabeth II, who both received 2 percent, along with former British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, poet Maya Angelou, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Elin
Nordegren Woods, wife of golfer Tiger Woods — all of whom received 1 percent.
Clinton has been named most admired woman by the poll 14 times, going back to her time
as first lady. Only then-first lady Laura Bush in 2001 and Mother Teresa in 1995 and 1996
have been able to knock Clinton from her perch, though Palin came close.
President Barack Obama ran away with the competition for most admired man, receiving
the endorsement of 30 percent of those polled.
Former President George W. Bush came in second with 4 percent, topping former South
African President Nelson Mandela's 3 percent.
Fox News host Glenn Beck, Pope Benedict XVI, the Rev. Billy Graham and Microsoft
founder Bill Gates all received 2 percent. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), former President
George H.W. Bush, former President Bill Clinton and Tiger Woods received support from
1 percent of those polled. Clinton and Woods tied for 10th place.

Subject: Haiti judge rules for release of U.S. missionaries
By Joseph Guyler Delva
PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - A Haitian judge said Thursday he had ruled in favor of the release of 10
U.S. missionaries accused of kidnapping 33 children and trying to take them out of the earthquake-stricken
country.
"I just signed the request for the release of the 10 Americans submitted by the lawyers and I have sent it to
the prosecutor's office," Judge Bernard Sainvil said.
He earlier told Reuters that once the prosecutor had given his opinion, he could formally issue a release order
for the Americans, who have been jailed since they were stopped at Haiti's border with the Dominican Republic
on Jan. 29.
Once the release order was issued, "they can go directly to the airport if they want and leave, but they should
provide a guarantee of representation if further questions need to be asked," Sainvil said.
Under Haitian law, the prosecutor can formally comment on the judge's decision but he cannot overrule it.
A judicial source told Reuters Wednesday that Sainvil had decided to free the U.S. missionaries because
there had been no evidence demonstrating "criminal intentions" on their part to support charges of child kidnap
and criminal association leveled against them.
The missionaries, most of whom belong to an Idaho-based Baptist church, were arrested trying to take the
children across the border to the Dominican Republic 17 days after a magnitude 7 earthquake that killed more
than 200,000 people in the impoverished Caribbean nation.
PLEAS FOR RELEASE FROM PARENTS
The five men and five women have denied any intentional wrongdoing and said they were only trying to
help orphans left destitute by the quake, which shattered the Haitian capital and left more than 1 million
homeless. But evidence showed that most of the children still had living parents.
During hearings in the case, Sainvil heard from 10 parents of children handed over to the Americans. They

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767115 Date: 08/31/2015
said they had turned them over because they had no food or water to give them, and believed they would have a
better life with the missionaries elsewhere.
These parents had pleaded for the Americans' release.
The case has been a distraction to the Haitian government as it tries to cope with the aftermath of the
earthquake and was diplomatically sensitive for the United States as it heads a massive international effort to
feed and shelter Haitian quake survivors.
The U.S. government had said it was providing the Americans with consular access and monitoring their
case, but made clear it did not want to interfere.
Haiti's beleaguered government had warned that traffickers could try to take advantage of the chaos that
followed the quake by taking away vulnerable children, and it tightened adoption procedures.

Today, the Haitian judge released eight of the ten American citizens and they have departed Haiti for the United
States. Two members of the group are being detained in Haiti to answer further questions, as the investigation is
ongoing. The United State Government respects the sovereign right of the Government of Haiti to conduct its
own judicial processes. The United States Embassy in Port au Prince has been providing the detained
Americans with consular visits and assistance to ensure that they are safe and receiving necessary care. Haitian
authorities have been cooperative in ensuring the individuals' safety and welfare since their arrest and we have
every expectation this will continue.

It is being reported that she (Coulter) was in Haiti before with Silsby:
(From AFP: Judge Bernard Saint-vil, who is handling the case, allowed them to leave the country without bail, according to their
lawyer Aviol Fleurant. But Saint-vil wants to question two other missionaries -- group leader Laura Silsby and her confidante Charisa
Coulter -- "because they were in Haiti before the earthquake," Fleurant added.)

Cheryl,
I'm sure we'll never know all that you and Secretary Clinton (and probably President Clinton too) did behind the scenes to secure the
release of Jim Allen and seven other Americans who were detained in Haiti for 20 days, but we wanted to thank you nevertheless. We
appreciated the promptness with which you assigned a first rate liaison to communicate with us - Ted Coley - and we appreciate the
accomodations State made in the form of information delivery to Jim and assistance with his return to the United States. Jim is resting
in Fort Lauderdale now and will return to Amarillo by private plane later in the morning. His wife Lisa is with him in Fort
Lauderdale. The country is fortunate to have first rate diplomats and crisis responders like you in positions of public responsibility,
and we appreciated your willingness to look carefully at the facts, including the distinctions between the roles played by each of the
Americans who went to Haiti as volunteers.
Again, thank you on our behalf, and on behalf of the Allen family, and best wishes with continuing relief and recovery efforts.

Exclusive: Is State Dept. #2 Steinberg On His Way Out?
Posted By Josh Rooin EFIThursday, February 4, 2010 - 6:12 PM
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767278 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767278 Date: 08/31/2015
Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg is being considered for the job of dean of the Georgetown
School of Foreign Service, multiple sources close to the process told The Cable.
Steinberg, the number-two official at the State Department, is widely regarded as a top-tier academic and
most recently served as dean of the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, Austin, but has
faced some turbulence since landing in Foggy Bottom.
Reportedly disappointed after initially angling for a higher position, Steinberg has taken on a broad
portfolio at State, both as Secretary Hillary Clinton's deputy and focusing on Asia as his personal policy
domain. But some State Department bureaucrats privately gripe about what they see as Steinberg's
sometimes intrusive style, and some of his policy proposals have been seen as poorly coordinated with the
other parts of the policy community. "He's a brilliant guy, but just not a great fit for that job," said one
administration source.
According to two sources familiar with the process, Steinberg has met with the Georgetown search
committee and expressed an interest in applying for the job. The search committee has also met with
individuals close to Steinberg, to hear their recommendations for him. Sources said the search committee
is still narrowing the candidate list and conducting interviews, before making any recommendations to the
university president.
When asked if he was a candidate for the job by The Cable, Steinberg said by email, "It would be news to
me."
The leading contender, according to insiders, is the current acting Dean Carol Lancaster. A graduate of
the School of Foreign Service herself, Lancaster was once deputy administrator of USAID and is a tenured
professor there now. Other potential candidates, according to sources, include former Undersecretary of
State Nicholas Burns, Princeton University professor Tom Christensen, and former State Department
official Marc Grossman. Grossman told The Cable he was contacted about the job, but he is not a
candidate. The others did not respond to requests for comment.
"Carol has brilliantly checked boxes," said Robert Gallucci, the immediate past dean, who now heads the
MacArthur Foundation after stepping down from the School of Foreign Service after 13 years. Gallucci
worked with Lancaster on the State Department's policy planning staff under Anthony Lake, another
Georgetown professor.
Gallucci is not part of the search committee, but talked with The Cable about the process and what the
school might be looking for.
"It's a wonderful, challenging job with great opportunity to impact young people who will be in positions of
leadership in the international sphere," Gallucci said, adding, "Somebody who had success in the policy
world, more likely in government service, could bring something special to the shaping of these minds and
the atmosphere of this school."

Mexico-Caricom Summit calls for Haiti rebirth
PLAYA DEL CARMEN, Mexico, Feb. 21 (Xinhua) -- Heads of state or government from the Caribbean region on Sunday
called for the earthquake disaster in Haiti to be a spur for the rebirth of the nation, during the opening session of the
first Mexico-Caricom Summit in Playa del Carmen, a resort city on Mexico's Caribbean coast.
"First on our agenda is Haiti," said Roosevelt Skerrit, the prime minister of Dominica and leader of the Caricom (the
Caribbean Community) until July. "We want to ensure reconstruction goes beyond immediate efforts. We have an
opportunity to bring about the renaissance of Haiti, not just to return to where we were before the disaster struck."
On Jan. 12, Haiti was struck by an earthquake measuring 7.3 on the Richter scale, which killed at least 200,000 people
and destroyed numerous homes, workplaces, infrastructure and government buildings.
Mexican President Felipe Calderon, who formally opened the summit on Sunday afternoon, said Haiti would be a top
priority, adding that the summit would also discuss boosting trade and growth across the Caribbean region, protecting
and developing tourism, boosting regional security, and tackling climate change. He said that Mexico was committed to
the region.
"Mexico is a nation that is Caribbean nation, powerfully Caribbean," Calderon said. "As such Mexico takes on its
responsibility of participating actively in the region's development."
During his speech, Haitian President Rene Preval said that as many as 300,000 people may have died in the devastating
quake last month.
"More than 200,000 bodies have been recovered from the streets, (and) with those under the rubble that figure could
reach 300,000, " he said. Preval also thanked the host Mexico for all the aid it had provided for Haiti's earthquake
victims.
"Haiti's friends realize that Haiti's true development cannot be built on aid, but must be based on investment," Preval
said, adding that the nation needs "not rebuilding but refounding."
"We need a more just nation that is not focused on Port-au- Prince where the political and economic elite live," he
stressed.

He also urged all those present to help the 1.5 million Haitians who he estimated were sleeping in the streets because
their homes were wrecked on Jan. 12. "The first rains that have begun to fall have already made all dignified living
impossible," he said, also warning that worse is to come when Haiti's rainy season begins in April.
The Mexico-Caricom Summit held on Sunday will be followed on Monday by a two-day Group of Rio Summit. Haiti is
both a Rio and Caricom member. During the Rio meeting, Mexico is set to propose that the Group be expanded into a
broader organization that brings together the 24-nation Group of Rio and 15-nation Caricom. Six of Caricom's members
are also Group of Rio members.

Cheryl;
As a postscript to what you mentioned about Haiti efforts being the prime example of a new form of shared
responsibility in the region and how Haiti reconstruction going forward can serve as the basis for this
organizing principle, I want to share some additional thoughts to support your point with the hope that Haiti
becomes a major theme of S's trip. To my knowledge, all the countries in the region (from richest to poorest)
have contributed in some form or another to the relief efforts. This is unprecedented in this region. And given
that this effort relates to Haiti in particular, it is even more remarkable. As you know, Haiti since its
independence in 1804 has often been seen by the rest of the region as a second class nation. As the Spanish-
speaking nations of South America gained independence in the 1820s, they excluded Haiti from their designs
for regional union — mostly out of fear by the Latins of slave revolts and uprisings by their own black and
indigenous populations. (Of course, we have had our own complex and unfortunate relationship with Haiti.) As
has been demonstrated by the recent UNASUR and Grupo Rio sessions, the same cannot be said of the region
today. And of the countries S is visiting, Chile is the richest and Guatemala is by the far the poorest but each of
these countries — and all in between - has been contributing in its own way to Haiti's recovery: Chile with
significant MINUSTAH forces, a portable hospital, supplies, and monetary pledge; Guatemala with food, a
rescue unit and a MINUSTAH pledge (and the fact that UN ASG Edmond Mulet is Guatemalan!). In the
context of the relief response, each country in the region has given, more or less, relative to their means.
Through this process of cooperation in Haiti's recovery, we as a region can collectively turn around Haiti's
history of isolation. This is a very significant historic moment and we need to run with it.
Sorry about the long email but wanted to share these thoughts — as one who has a particular relationship with
the island of Hispaniola. In this context, I want to share a 1994 Washington Post below which, although •
covering a different type of crisis, is demonstrative of how times have changed.
Thanks. Julissa

haiti history of isolation
The United States finds itself virtually alone struggling with the Haitian crisis.
A handful of tiny Caribbean nations have agreed to shelter a few thousand refugees. But not one
major political ally or trading partner in the Western Hemisphere has stepped up to help. In a joint
statement yesterday, three of six Central American countries said they might take in Haitians. The
other three said they would not.
Slippery promises are all that President Clinton gets when he seeks recruits for a peacekeeping
force; none seems willing to join an invasion to oust the military leaders who seized power in 1991.
Panama's president-elect, Ernesto Perez Balladares, explained the lack of support in a recent
interview: "It is for the very simple reason that in Latin America Haiti is not recognized as a Latin
American country. Haitians speak a different language. They have different ethnic roots, a different
culture. They are very different altogether."
Overwhelmingly black, speaking Creole French, practicing voodoo, a nation of liberated slaves long
locked in deep poverty, Haiti has a history ofisolation within the hemisphere. It doesn't fit with the big
countries of South America. It is not part of Central America. It has no real kinship with the other
island-nations of the Caribbean.
"Haitians are strangers even among the other black nations of the Caribbean," said Jocelyn McCalla,
executive director of the National Coalition for Haitian Refugees, a New York-based advocacy group.
Haitians are "just as strange to someone from Grenada or Jamaica as they would be to someone
from Iowa or Montana."

it would tighten border security in case any Haitians escaped.
In recent years, the Organization of American States (OAS) and the United Nations have worked to
compel elections in Haiti, to put sanctions on its military regime and to monitor human rights abuses.
Now, Clinton is asking for much more as he tries to create a network of refugee camps around the
region and to assemble multinational backing for the forcible removal of Haiti's military regime.
Finding partners for either sheltering refugees or invading would be a challenge no matter what
country was involved. Petitioning on behalf of Haiti makes it much harder.
"Unsympathetic perceptions of Haiti as a hopeless case work against the kind of cooperation that the
administration is seeking, and those perceptions are deeply ingrained," said Wayne Smith, a senior
fellow at the Center for International Policy.
Haiti's isolation goes back to its 1804 independence. "Here was a nation born of a slave revolt. It
raised fears of another slave revolt in many other nations which then simply shunned Haiti for
decades to come," Smith said.
As the Spanish-speaking nations of South America gained independence in the 1820s, they excluded
Haiti from their designs for regional union. U.S. recognition did not come until 1862, when the Civil
War made it politically expedient.
Haiti's chronic poverty, its chaotic succession of despots and its conflicts with the Dominican Republic
have deepened its isolation.
Is racism a factor in the shunning of Haiti? Perhaps not: Black and mixed-race nations have
sometimes demonstrated biases against Haiti.
But allegations of racism have often beset U.S. policy toward Haiti and are a major factor in the
evolution of the current crisis.
The U.S. invasion of Haiti in 1915 produced a 19-year occupation that included the imposition of
racial segregation and the use of forced labor.

Randall Robinson, head of the TransAfrica lobbying organization, said, "For almost 200 years U.S.
policies have treated Haiti differently than other nations with the painful consequences always visited
on Haitians who happen to be black."
This history, Robinson said, combined with the fact that the slave revolt earned Haiti "a place of pride
for people in the African diaspora," has made U.S. policy toward Haiti a logical target for U.S. blacks.
The activism has focused on what Robinson called "the despicable practice of repatriation."
Since 1991 the United States has tried to intercept Haitian boat people fleeing the military regime
before they could reach U.S. shores; most have been taken back to Haiti. No other nationality has
suffered that form of rejection.
As Robinson went into the 27th day of a hunger strike on May 8, Clinton announced he would end the
repatriation policy and begin more aggressive efforts to remove the Haitian military regime.
But Haiti's isolation has contributed to Clinton's setbacks trying to deal with the intertwined problems
of the generals and the refugees fleeing them.
On July 7, Panama backed out of an agreement to accept 10,000 Haitians, citing technicalities in the
Panama Canal Treaty. Balladares, who has promised to consider a more limited safe haven for
Haitians after he takes office Sept. 1, said the decision had nothing to do with the 1978 treaty and
everything to do with the way ordinary Panamanians view Haitians.
"People were very afraid of having the Haitians in the country and justifiably so," he said. "They were
afraid of competing for scarce resources, afraid of people whose culture is different in many ways,
afraid of the AIDS problem. That is why the government backed out and everything else is excuses."
Piero Gleijeses, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, said:
"Even if the Latin Americans felt some kinship to the Haitians, they would not be anxious to take in
refugees under these circumstances. They see the big, rich United States, a traditional nation of
resettlement, turning away the Haitians and they ask why they should have to take up the burden."
Nearly all nations of the hemisphere have rallied around the idea of restoring democracy to Haiti, but
they are as reluctant to pursue that goal with force as they are to shelter Haitian refugees. Both
fundamental trends and the peculiarities of the Haitian case are at work.

Among Latin American governments the traditional distaste for U.S. military intervention has been
growing more explicit in recent years. For example, an OAS resolution censuring the United States
for the 1989 invasion of Panama marked the first time since the founding of the organization 42 years
earlier that it had formally criticized the United States.
In addition, the absence of a functioning political infrastructure and the prospects for lingering
violence in Haiti have made many Latin American countries leery of joining a peacekeeping force.
Chile, which in early July said it would support the restoration of democracy through a multinational
effort, has since insisted that it would offer "technical assistance" only after a democratic government
was operating in Haiti and could specifically request such help.
Summing up the attitudes across the region, Balladares said, "Everyone just wishes that this problem
would go away."

Haiti®s prime minister targeted for
ouster by lawmakers
Haitian senators want to oust the country's prime minister, clad ing
she has moved too slowly in addressing crucial problems.
BY JACQUELINE CHARLES
JCHARLES@MIAMIHERALD.COM
PORT-AU-PRINCE -- With Haiti poised to enjoy the economic benefits of long-elusive stability, foreign
diplomats are scrambling behind the scenes to keep it all from unraveling as several lawmakers derhand the
ouster of the country's prime minister.
A small but powerful group of senators is seeking the removal of Prime Minister Miche&grave;le Pierre-Louis --
and possibly several of her ministers -- on charges that she has moved too slowly to solve Haiti's problems.
"The situation is critical," said Sen. Jean Hector Anacasis, who is among the six senators behind a recent
summons for Pierre-Louis to appear before Haiti's Senate on Thursday. Under Haiti's constitution, the Senate
can fire a sitting government.
"We are the ones on the ground who hear the people's cry, who hear them criticizing us, the government,
saying nothing has been done. We have to replace the woman," Anacasis said. "If they are accusing us of
inviting a crisis, then we are inviting a crisis to avert another crisis."
The internal political maneuvering comes just three weeks after former U.S. President and U.N. Special Envoy
to Haiti Bill Clinton led a historic trade mission here, triggering optimism that this land of seemingly missed
opportunities may finally be turning around.

Before a gathering of 600 investors -- 200 of them foreign -- Clinton championed Haiti's stability, promising that
the risks were the lowest they have ever been in a crisis-prone Haiti. Now, both Haitian and foreign observers
fear that political differences could trigger a crisis and send potential investors packing.
"They cannot afford to do this. It is not good for investments," said one diplomat who asked for anonymity
because of the sensitivity of what is viewed as a domestic matter. "It is all so frustrating."
On Monday, diplomats spent the day shuffling between meetings with President Rene Preval, and discussions
with Pierre-Louis. The matter even warranted a weekend phone call to Preval from U.S. Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton. Clinton spoke of her concerns and reiterated U.S. support for Pierre-Louis, according to several
sources privy to the conversation.
Preval, in turn, told Clinton that he was not behind the move to oust Pierre-Louis and has no control over the
lawmakers. Critics disagree, pointing out that following the recent Senate elections, marred by fraud
allegations and low turnout, Preval now controls two-thirds of the chamber, and that most of the six senators
leading the charge are from his Lespwa (HOPE) political coalition,
POLITICALLY RISKY
Still, some are asking whether he's willing to spend the political capital to prevent the ouster of Pierre-Louis, a
one-time friend and confidante who accepted her appointment as a storm-battered Haiti was gripped by
political gridlock after the Senate fired then-Prime Minister Jacques-Edouard Alexis following food riots then
failed to ratify two of Preval's choices.
Neither Preval nor Pierre-Louis responded to interview requests from The Miami Herald. In a taped message to
the nation Monday night, Pierre-Louis defended her government's record and explained her reasons for taking
the job.
Since her appointment a year ago, Pierre-Louis has appeared often before parliament but this is the first time
she has been summoned, a move that usually signals a no-confidence vote.
Pierre-Louis has mustered considerable support abroad from her many trips, including stops in South Florida.
But she has failed to win over supporters in parliament. Her dismissal, in effect, would topple her government.
Initially, senators were seeking to dismiss the ministers of finance and justice, both of whom are close to
Pierre-Louis. But after three days of meetings at a hotel near the palace, senators decided to issue the
summons to Pierre-Louis, Anacasis told The Miami Herald.
A majority of the 29 senators have indicated they would vote to fire Pierre-Louis, Anacasis said.

Pierre-Louis was in Europe on business, and returned to Haiti Sunday night where she was greeted by a small
group of protesters waving signs saying, "We are tired of changing governments."
In her defense, a handful of lawmakers and supporters have pleaded with the group of six to cancel Thursday's
hearing.
'SELF-INTEREST
"Since becoming prime minister, she,has struggled with limited human and financial resources and with a
structure of government that has been emasculated over decades of mismanagement and selfish politics," said
Robert Maguire, a Haiti expert at Washington, D.C.-based Trinity University.
"She has had to confront the narrow politics of self-interest imposed upon her ability to govern. And yet, she
has persevered, building a solid track record of relief and recovery in the aftermath of Haiti's devastating
storms of late 2008 and thereby contributing immensely to that spirit of Haiti's hope for a brighter future."
It's unclear what has triggered the move, though some believe it revolves around Haiti's presidential elections.
While still a year away, political jockeying already has begun, with some suggesting politicians may be seeking
to position themselves and candidates for the scheduled November 2010 elections.
Meanwhile on Monday, as politicians weighed whether Pierre-Louis would fight or resign, some supporters
tried to persuade her to visit Preval to see if the two could reach a compromise. She has said she will fight, but
has no plans to go before parliament and be humiliated. That has some wondering whether she would resign
before Thursday.
Patrick Delatour, Haiti's tourism and acting commerce minister, said lawmakers should weigh the
consequences of their actions carefully.
"They should understand solving problems by any government is a process, a slow process," he said. "Firing
this government does not mean the next government will be able to solve the problems any faster. It definitely
means the process of solving problems will stop and will have to start again."

SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSFIED
HAITI
• Jack reported briefly on his conversations with Lowey and Oberstar on Haiti. Lowey raised two concerns: first,
that we don't care about education in Haiti and, second, that we don't care about education in general. Jack
pushed back on both fronts. He noted that Lowey also emphasized the need for accountability in what we are
spending. Oberstar identified the type of trees that need to be planted for reforestation in Haiti, and said that
the shift to propane gas won't work; we need instead to focus on providing the right sort of charcoal.
• H reported Friday's CODEL to Haiti has been cancelled.
Iraq
• Jack noted that we will set up monthly meetings on Iraq transition with the team here in Washington and the
team in Baghdad. He also reported on a meeting with a two-star General and our DCM yesterday, in which the
two-star complained about allegedly inadequate funding in our budget for transition issues in 2011. Jack said
that the budget had been agreed interagency and DoD had endorsed it.
Middle East

Northern Mexico
Pat voiced concern over the uptick in violence in northern Mexico and possible threats to our employees, noting
we were doing everything possible to keep our people safe.
PUBLIC AFFAIRS
• PJ said his description of recent Israeli designation of new heritage sites in the West Bank as "provocative" had
attracted some attention.
• PA will put out a statement expressing concern over the Italian court decision against Google.

LEGAL AFFAIRS
• L, AF and others will send the Secretary a memo on the implications of the coup in Niger.
* Harold believes we are close to an understanding with the Canadian on the return of Khadr, if we can return him
under the right terms.
* SecDef Gates has still not signed off on Article 75 of the First Additional Geneva Protocol. It may require another
intervention by the Secretary.
• Harold suggested, if possible, that the Secretary make an appearance at the American Society of International
Law in late March.
REGIONAL BUREAUS MEETING
10
• There will be a vote in the General Assembly tomorrow on a resolution on the Goldstone Report. The text is
relatively moderate, but U.S. and Israel will likely be alone in opposing it. (Our friends in the Pacific have lost
their votes for the time being because of non-payment of dues.)
o Human Rights Council begins Monday and runs for four weeks. Maria Otero will be there for the opening.
EUR
• Inauguration in Ukraine went without incident, though Tymoshenko boycotted the ceremony. Yanukovich has
said he wants to visit Washington early on to focus on bilateral relations and meet with IMF officials.
• Jim Steinberg will travel to China next week. Chinese have made an official invitation. Will be no public
announcement for the time being.
• Kurt Campbell will meet with Tom Donilon to discuss the President's Indonesia trip, preparations for which are
not going well. The changing political climate in Indonesia has made them extremely cautious.
• Yar'Adua's return to Nigeria has unsettled the political situation and sparked rumors of possible military
intervention. WH is considering a letter from the President to Nigeria's political elite urging restraint and
cooperation.
• On the good news front, the rapprochement between Chad and Sudan and the signing of a ceasefire agreement
with the JEM represent real progress.
• Situation in Somalia remains poor, with reports of a likely TFG offensive in Mogadishu and a build-up of forces
on both sides.

If our early assessment of today's election in Honduras holds, we will have just been witness to a remarkable thing:
Honduran voters have taken back their democracy from two failed leaders -- Zelaya and Micheletti -- who had driven
Honduras to isolation and despair.
The turnout (probably a record) and the clear rejection of the Liberal Party shows our approach was the right one, and
puts Brazil and others who would not recognize the election in an impossible position. As we think about what to say, I
would strongly recommend that we not be shy. We should congratulate the Honduran people, we should connect
today's vote to the deep democratic vocation of the Honduran people, and we should call on the community of
democratic nations (and especially those of the Americas) to recognize, respect, and respond to this accomplishment of
the Honduran people.
Finally, this Administration, which worked so hard to manage and resolve this crisis, should be the one who defines the
results and perceptions of today's vote, and not our critics on the Hill (who had no clear pathway to elections) or our
adversaries in the region (who never wanted this day to happen).

« The Sunday Shows In Five Bullet Points I Main
Nov 29 2009, 9:13 pm by Marc Ambinder
A Last-Minute Meeting On Afghanistan
President Obama convened a last-minute meeting of his national security team tonight to discuss the language that his
administration will use to describe its new strategy for Afghanistan. Two administration sources confirmed that the
meeting, which began at 5:oo pm, included cabinet officials like Defense Secretary Robert Gates. The officials would not
describe the meeting and said that no other news organizations were being given any background briefing. That suggests
that the meeting was akin to a pre-game rally session by the commander-in-chief: he wants to gert everyone from Gates to
Gen. Stanley McChrystal to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on the same page before the president's Tuesday speech.
Before young officers at West Point, Obama will announce his decision about Afghanistan to an increasingly skeptical
nation and a Democratic Congress that is threatening to condition its budgeting on identifiable off-ramps and
timeframes. Obama is expected to announce that he'll order several Army combat brigades to Afghanistan -- about
30,00o troops in all, most of them to be tasked with more rapidly standing up Afghanistan's indigenous army. His speech,
as described in broad terms by advisers last week, will be short and serious. His challenge is to persuade Americans that
the war in Afghanistan is winnable, as Americans tend to give their presidents significant leeway so long as they believe
that the president is confident in his strategy. Officials said last week that while would outline a clear exit strategy, he
would not tie troop withdrawals to any specific political developments in Afghanistan, which might run into opposition
from Democrats in Congress, who are demanding benchmarks. Nor is the President likely to impose direct conditions on
Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai. An official said that Obama plans to try explain the interconnection between the the
stability of Pakistan and the nexus of terror in Afghanistan. An explanation that the American people would accept has
proven elusive.

Ted and Drew,
This evening at approximately 5:30pm local time, I received a call from Argentine judge Federico Summer of Neuquen
province (borders Chile in southwest Argentina). He advised me that on Monday, November 23, 2009, a 16-year old

local boy discovered the decomposed body of a male in a remote wooded area overlooking the lake in the Patagonian
town of San Martin de los Andes. The judge mentioned he had seen last week's television interview
(http://www.infobae.comkienera1/485486-601275-0-Un-norteamericano-desaparecido-hace-casi-dos-meses-el-
packCYADADs) in which I described Roberto Yaryura's disappearance on September 19, 2009, and he remembered the
photo of the unique tattoo on Roberto's right arm mentioned in the interview and widely published in the national
media here throughout Argentina.
The judge sent me the pictures of the body taken at the location where it was found, and I sent one picture, a close-up
shot of the tattooed right arm to Roberto's best friend (who recently flew down here for 10 days to search for him) for
identification. He and the artist who designed the unique tattoo, also one of Roberto's best friends, confirmed for me
over the phone that it was, indeed, Roberto's tattoo in the photo.
I notified Roberto's siblings, together with their families, and they
asked me
until after their sister had given her the news in person later tonight. I confirmed that I would wait until tomorrow to
contact to discuss her preference for disposition of Roberto's body and transfer of the remains.
Judge Summer noted that they are conducting an autopsy on Roberto's body to rule out foul play, and that the case is
now considered an open criminal investigation until the autopsy results determine he died of natural causes. Local
medics estimate the time of death to be approximately thirty to forty days prior the body's discovery. The judge added
that he would do everything possible to expedite any necessary paperwork with respect to disposition of the body once
they have ruled out any criminal aspect to this case. would like to fly down next week, if
possible, to pick up his remains to bring them back to the United States.
I would like to thank my colleagues in Uruguay, Brazil, Paraguay, and Bolivia, copied here, for all their efforts to track
down Roberto. In my conversation with the siblings, they wanted me to pass on their gratitude to everyone for their
efforts to find Roberto.
Best,
Shannon

Twitter vs. Terror
How the U.S. State Department should enable and encourage social-networking sites in the global fight for
freedom.
BY U.S. SEN. RICHARD G. LUGAR I JANUARY 6, 2010
During the turmoil that followed Iran's disputed 2009 presidential election, thousands of opposition supporters and
other protesters communicated and organized through Twitter. So important was this social networking site to
supporting the pro-democracy "green movement" that the U.S. State Department contacted corporate
representatives of Twitter to ask them to delay a routine maintenance shutdown of the microblogging site.
In the strife-torn Democratic Republic of the Congo, U.S. officials are working with radio and cell-phone operators
to reach isolated militia fighters with messages from former combatants now urging them to put down their arms
and return to civilian life.
In Pakistan, the State Department paid for 24 million text messages as a way to help support a new mobile-phone-
based social network, Humani Awaz, or "Our Voice." The gesture helps increase U.S. government engagement with
the Pakistani people, strengthens communities, and can assist small businesses in gaining better market
information.
These are just some of the latest examples of what is being called "21st-century statecraft," using the capabilities of
modern communications and social networking technologies to win hearts and minds and improve the American
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767562 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767562 Date: 08/31/2015
image abroad. It represents an important leap forward from traditional U.S. outreach efforts, such as Voice of
America and Radio Free Europe.
The adroit use of social networking sites, such as Twitter, Facebook, and others, coupled with text messages and
increasingly widespread mobile-phone technology, can help lend support to existing grassroots movements for
freedom and civil rights, connect people to information, and help those in closed societies communicate with the
outside world. It also promises to give a strong economic boost to small entrepreneurs and the rural poor. The World
Bank estimates that for every 10 percent increase in the number of mobile-phone users in a developing country,
there is nearly a 1 percent increase in its economic output.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has championed the use of communications technology in diplomacy and
development. In November in Morocco, she announced the "Civil Society 2.0" initiative, which will offer training
and advice to local nongovernmental organizations around the world on how to use the Internet and other digital
media to organize, communicate, and be more effective.
She has also appointed a special advisor for innovation, Alec Ross, to examine ways to employ communications
technology to enhance traditional diplomatic and development activities. In a recent speech, he said that the State
Department is using "these new connection technologies to engage and empower our interlocutors in new and
different ways that are consistent with our foreign policy goals."
The applications vary widely. In Mexico, for instance, where drug-related crime and violence is at crisis level, the
United States is helping set up a mobile-phone-based system so citizens can report crimes and tips anonymously. In
Afghanistan, the State Department and the Pentagon are working with the private sector to expand mobile-phone
banking, an innovation that has been successful in Africa. The hope is to improve the finances of people in rural
conflict areas. When violence displaced up to 2 million people from Pakistan's Swat Valley, the State Department
quickly set up a mobile texting system so concerned Americans could make $5 donations for refugee relief with just
a few keystrokes.
Technology offers new ways to perform the traditional task of spreading the American message. During President
Barack Obama's major Africa speech in Ghana last year, for instance, the government offered SMS texts of his
remarks in English and French to cell-phone users across Africa and enabled them to post questions and comments.
But social networking technologies are more often used to enable individuals across a country, or across the globe, to
interact, engage, and become empowered. Although this means that our government will not be able to control the
message as well as it might with conventional public diplomacy tools, I believe it is a risk worth taking. Terrorists
and other anti-American propagandists have for some time been using the Internet and other techniques to

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767562 Date: 08/31/2015
communicate and recruit. America needs to beat them at their own game, especially since we invented most of the
technology.
I would encourage the administration and our diplomats to be nimble, flexible, and innovative as they pursue a wide
range of foreign-policy initiatives that use these new communication and connection techniques. Diplomacy and
development are our best means of winning the global war of ideas, and we must come to the battle armed with the
most modern tools at our disposal.

Andy Young is a very good friend of mine, and has been a stalwart for the Clintons over the years. He is also one of the
most recognized and respected experts on Africa in America. He asked me today if I thought it would be appropriate for
him to seek to see the Secretary to share some of his thoughts on Africa and current issues being confronted there. I
told him of course and suggested that he reach out to you to try to arrange that dialogue. Hopefully that is ok from your

the #s are still strong
2. SMS 4636 info project (where people in Haiti can text and report needs and locations):
• 707 texts were rec'd, 402 were deemed useful, 125 had enough details that volunteers on the ground
could plot the longitude and latitude to find them quickly
• Only works on Digicel. Comcel/Voila are evaluating
• Trying to get Wyclef and radio stations to start promoting
• Data is currently going to Reuters Emergency Service, InSTEDD and ICRC
• We're working on getting it to USAID
• Note, this effort is brand new and entirely volunteer run
• Breakdown of types of calls:

is so wonderful. Brilliant pick. Every time I meet with her I like her more and more and she is really the right pick for
ECA. She brings so much to the table that we need. Everyone here is so pleased with the selection and the fact that R is
equally pleased is even better —that we can both think she is "ours" is a testament to Ann. It may have taken a long time
but it will be well worth the wait. She can take ECA in a new direction. And if she has the help of Joe Macmanus she can
do it even quicker and better (I can't pass up a good plug opportunity!).

Cheryl,
As of this hour of Thursday night there is no deal on an ironclad, substantive, political platform of national solidarity and
governance reform, in return for Abdullah's gracious concession which would obviate the constitutional and political
need for a problematic 2nd round.
Karl and I remain in close touch with the candidates as they continue their engagement. But short of a miracle, there
will be no such deal at least until Friday evening or Saturday morning, if then.
Hence, as we understand the exigencies of our Boss's travel sked, it appears to be time to pull the plug: we won't be
recommending before our Friday evening that she make a stop in Kabul on Saturday. The default remains: no Kabul
stop.
Nonetheless, Abdullah has now set Saturday as the date for his address to the nation, and Karzai clearly wants both for
him to concede, and to attract a visit of the Secretary. The best scenario would have been an announcement in the
presence of the Secretary, as a trusted witness to whom the parties would be more or less politically accountable. If we
get happy news by Saturday morning and the Boss can't come then, or perhaps a day or two later on route home from
the ME, then we'll likely be recommending that she again phone each of the two protagonists, followed by a positive
public statement.

Subject: Earthquake in Chile
Paul Simons called me shortly after earthquake hit Chile (8.5 Richter-- stronger than Haiti). He was going to reach out to
advance team. Marriott Hotel fine. Event frightening because of intensity of tremor. Epicenter near Concepcion-- third
largest city in Chile about 400 miles south of Santiago (city of Cauquenes--- hardest hit).
Just heard Bachelet on TV-- casualties so far 16-- though because communications down and it is still dark information is
preliminary. Some concern over risk of Tsunami though Navy deems unlikely. Fortunately, there is no collapse of dams.
Considerable damage to highway bridges and infrastructure--that will affect traffic-- in Talca hospital evacuated for
precautionary reasons. President declared zones of Maule and Bio Bio disaster areas.
Significant loss of life and damage unlikely because Chile suffered devastating earthquakes in 1939 and 1960 (the
strongest in recorded history) in same area so most old construction is gone. Chile has strong construction codes and
state of the art anti-earthquake standards. Also Chile has excellent first responder capacity. One concern of course are
aftershocks. In 1960 (May 21) a second earthquake occurred day after that caused a Tsunami in Japan.
Will have to evaluate whether trip to Chile should proceed. Precisely because of tragedy this may not be time to cancel -
- provided Chilean side can handle and are anxious for trip to proceed. Suspect that that will be the case. Should
evaluate in morning after dust settles.

One other thought.
If the idea of building network of small new schools is just nuts given the infrastructure challenges, an alternative is
more of the 'street school' approach. We take storefronts, little mom and pop storefronts, etc... and do minor
reconfiguration and you have a whole set of little street schools clustered around central location. This could work, poses
some challenges re: isolation of teachers, ability to offer a robust set of classes/offerings, but can still do the job, and can
still have clear grand openings to help junnpstart culture, etc.

Hey Cheryl,
Here are some quick thoughts on re-building school infrastructure in Port-au-Prince. Feel free to share with whomever
you'd like.
I have little idea of the larger context here — how many schools/kids are we looking at, but one thing we've learned in the
US in the last 5 years is that good teachers are the #1 lever of change in education. If we got 1,000 really great teachers
into Port-au-Prince (w/ even a modicum of support and materials), they'd make a big difference and touch the lives of
30,000-60,000 kids.
I think this is totally doable, in short-order, in a magnificent way that could set the foundation for a well-educated
generation of Haitians who could lead the country out of poverty, to self-sustainability, self-governance and openness.
To do--
Goal 1: Bring immediate influx of human capital into education sector in concentrated areas, and map out plan for long-
term development of teachers/human capital.
Goal 2: Build curriculum, instructional materials that will support current Haitian elementary age students learning the
academic and related skills they need to lead country to long-term sustainability.
Goal 3: Build/reconstruct schools and training centers that will support high quality education, and on their own, motivate
and inspire children, families, and communities to send children to school.
Goal 4: Create (develop) family, community, economic, cultural, socio-political infrastructure that encourages and support
all children going to school through elementary school, with goal of eradicating illiteracy and expanding the average level
of education for Port-a-Prince residents to the [6thi8to grade.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767787 Date: 08/31/2015
Goal 1: Human Capital:
Create Haiti Teacher Corps. Model loosely off of Peace Corps/Teach for America, CityYear
Teacher corps (US): Recruit, train, and place 500-1000 teachers from US this spring and summer. We can do
this.
o Recruiting: Limit variable this year, and build up and out as we go. This spring we go to Georgetown,
Univ of Maryland and Univ of Miami and University of Florida/S. Florida. Given crisis, current opportunities
in the US, we could easily hire 500 college graduates of very high quality from 4 major universities under
2 year contracts.
o Summer institute is 8 weeks in US; language training, intensive teacher training; onsite at two major
universities (College Park, Univ. of Miami).
o Language/culture training: TDB – find the best folks out there to train in French/Creole, and Haitian
culture, current socio-political situation – 50% of the training program.
o Academic training: We'll work w/ TFA and others and develop 8 week intensive teacher training program
for other 50% of program.
Teacher Corps (Haitian):
o I need to learn more on this... but this would likely be critical both short-and long-term.
o Need to know who/how to recruit. Avoid political pitfalls; focus on what we've learned about good
teachers—you want people who have excelled in something—almost anything; so, we set up recruiting
team on the ground in Haiti to find cohort of 500 new teachers; training is nearly identical to US teaching
corp (i.e., modeled off of TFA summer institute).
o Training: either bring them over to US to live and learn w/ US counterparts, or if that's too precarious, look
to move them out of the city for 6-8 weeks over the summer. Find space 100 miles out and build summer
camp/institute for them.
Teacher leaders/principals/trainers:
o Much easier than you'd think. Huge network now in the charter and ed reform community of hard-
working, mission-driven teacher-leaders who would take this on.
o (US Based) TFA/New Teacher Project alumni are in schools all over the US. They have taught for 2-6
years, want a chance to do something totally meaningful. This is is. We'll recruit 100-200 of them, and
they will lead cohorts of 20 teachers...
o Haiti-based: Less clear what the teacher-leader pipeline is like...but we can figure out and get whoever
we can.
Compensation, related.
o We should build dorms/apts for people. Serve food in cafeteria's on-site at the schools; have community
kitchens available, etc.
o All US staff gets paid minimally during their tour/commitment, but earns stipends/completion bonuses. If
folks convinced their expenses will be covered, they will have money to spend, we then backload
this. So, might be a $10,000 salary and a $10,000 bonus upon completion. You live cheap; two years
later, you get check that amounts to what you would have saved if you had been living, working, paying
bills, etc. in the US.
o Not sure about how to do Haitian pay. But structure similarly.
What do we need to accomplish the Human Capital Goal?
o In the US, not much.
• A small staff of the right people could recruit, interview, assess and hire 500 corp members and
we could get that done between Feb 1 and June 1, 2010—easily.
• Cost:
• 2-4 staff on board by 2.1; 10-15 staff on board by 3.1.10; that team will get everyone
hired by 6.1.10
• Summer training institutes: 500-100 teachers, housing at universities; training/supervision
staff at 1:20 ratio to recruits
• 8.1.10—Teaching Corp heads to Haiti, ongoing cost of housing, stipends/salary, health
care, training/supervision, etc (we could build out draft operating budget quickly, but not
doing that now).
o In Haiti, less clear, but I think if we identify the right people, we'd concurrently recruit, interview, assess,
hire 500 people.
• Staffing and Cost: See notes above re: US recruitment and training. Assess current status in
Haiti, and set up staffing, recruiting, hr function.
Concurrently, we have team that is developing summer training materials, and working on curriculum/content (see
below).
Concurrently, we have team that is working on facilities (see below)
Concurrently, we have team working on community outreach (see below).

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767787 Date: 08/31/2015
Goal 2: Build a robust curriculum and teacher instruction grogram
We need to immediately tilt teaching and learning in the early grades to the skills and contents that are necessary in Haiti
so that it people can enable it grow and develop economically, politically.
I am not a curriculum expert, but I think this is really doable, as well, so long as we get the right team—which in this case
is likely a team of leading experts from Haiti, possibly other countries that have intentionally undergone an intensive ramp-
up in the education sector, and US curriculum writers.
US-Team:
o Similar to above, there is incredible talent in the charters, and in a few major cities where structural
education reform has taken hold.
o We just need a small team to join us for 1 year to help us jump start the project.
Haiti/Other countries:
o We need to talk w/ folks in Haiti and find current state of curriculum, standards, instructional guides,
books, materials, etc.
Backwards Mapping: This is not as hard as it seems.
o We get the right people to help us figure out what a 10-12 year old Haitian should know and we map
backwards, all the way to preschool.
o Once we get an end goal in key areas – math, reading, writing, history/social studies, science:. .we map
backwards and start to define what we will teach.
o And once we decide this, we use some of the tools we've developed in the US in the last 5-10 years to
help us write curriculum, produce instructional materials.
o This will be a jumbled mess to start... but will work and sort itself out.
o We build it in clusters and in modules that can be swapped in and out, and mixed and matched. You
want to give teachers tools so they can be successful with kids of different ages and abilities, particularly
early on when we're likely to be operating more like one-room school houses than grade level schools
we're used to here.
o We build in assessments, standards, and teach teachers how to recognize when kids are falling behind,
how to build in supports and tutorials.
o The goal is to get large cohort of younger kids, I think, who start to learn and be taught to standards... all
the while, we push hard in the upper grades, knowing it will be a lot less clear (and possibly much more
directed towards helping current teens develop basic skills they need to be employable and contributing
members of the rebuilding efforts –so this may be basic literacy, key vocational skills, etc.).
Cost/staffing: Small US team that works with Haitian/other country team. Within a year or so, this team should be
Haiti-based, w/ possible long-term support/membership from the US team. The start-up team sets up framework,
establishing learning standards, builds tools and cranks out curricular materials—some of which are developed
specifically for Haiti, but many of which may be translations from high quality materials from US and elsewhere.
Goal 3: Build high quality, durable schools that entice families, children into education.
In spite of current situation, this seems like another very doable goal.
Get some schools built quickly to entice attendance.
o Once rebuilding starts up, we can build schools quickly, affordably. And once they are up, if done
correctly, they will immediately be attractive to families and communities. This, ironically, will be the case
if we can get schools up quickly—while much of the other infrastructure is still in poor shape. Families will
want kids in schools if the schools are safe, offer food, health care and structure—much of which will be
wanting in devastated, poor neighborhoods.
I'm not facilities expert, either; this is an area where we can look to other examples in the developing world for
best practices. Nonprofits and governments have worked together to build great schools in many places in Africa,
South America, and even recently in the Middle East.
To think about: Consider technology and technology infrastructure as a part of the initial construction plan so it's
not add-on later.
To think about: Keeping the schools small, functional, really basic will help us get them up; including significant
health care and related services complicates planning, build-out, but increases functionality.
Cost/staffing: I don't have enough knowledge about this, particularly in Haiti. I think it would be quite easy to find
the best models and quickly develop turnkey model for design/build that would ensure functionality, safety, and
cost compliance.
Once we have this, we either develop this capacity internally, or contract out and get these built, quickly.
Goal 4: Create family, community impetus for all school age children to be in school

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767787 Date: 08/31/2015
This is both the end-game and a necessary condition along the way.
The simpleton in me thinks that highly engaged, spirited teachers, inside safe, modern school buildings that serve
healthy meals at no charge will, for some period of time (years) be a catalyst for socio-political change. And if we
can get traction for a few years, and get large cohorts of young children actively engaged in school, then it will be
hard to unwind the long-term, salutary benefits.
Clearly, if families remain in poverty, and adults have no means to earn enough money to support families, then
children of all ages, but particularly as they move toward teen years, will be attracted to alternatives other than
school—some legitimate, but low-wage, and others illegal and destructive.
In short-term, while we are developing program, we should be doing extensive community outreach and in all
cases, getting neighborhoods and communities engaged in the pre-planning process. Families everywhere get
excited about a new school, new teachers, and a new chance. And w should play on this—this will enable us to
do necessary planning around enrollment, student/family needs, etc. We shouldn't sort of move slowly from no
school to some school, we should go from no school to a new school and fresh start—even if that delays opening
a bit. The first day should be major community event, that everyone can reflect upon and hold to in difficult times.
Gotta run. See you shortly.

Subject: Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative - Award to Secretary Clinton
Importance: High •
Hello and Happy New Year Jim,
Friends of WFP has decided to provide its annual "Leadership in the Fight Against Hunger" Award to Secretary Clinton this
year. The award is presented at a ceremony on Capitol Hill (within one of the House/Senate caucus
rooms). Approximately 200 people attend the event including Members of Congress, NGO representatives, business
leaders, administration officials and other leaders in the fight against hunger.
As you know, Friends of WFP is a non-profit organization dedicated to addressing global hunger. Its board members
include former agriculture secretary Dan Glickman, former Senators George McGovern and Bob Dole, YUM Brands CEO
David Novak, former NSC Advisor Sandy Berger and others. I established the organization in 1997.
Before officially announcing Secretary Clinton as this year's award recipient, we hoped to confirm that Secretary Clinton
will be available to personally accept the award. We plan to schedule the award ceremony in September on either a
Tuesday or Wednesday evening (at approximately 6:30/7pm). We would select the specific date based on Secretary
Clinton's schedule.
I think the ceremony would provide another good opportunity to shine a spotlight on the unprecedented commitment of
Secretary Clinton and President Obama to addressing global hunger. Thank you for your help in engaging the
appropriate officials in the State Department.
All the Best,
Rick Leach

First, a word of thanks for the input that many of you provided on our Global Hunger and Food Security
Initiative consultation document. We received a large amount of interest and excellent suggestions on the
document, and we will soon release a new version that reflects this input.
We are also drafting an implementation plan that will describe in greater detail how we intend to implement the
initiative. We look forward to sharing both documents with you.
In recent months, we have continued to garner international support for the five core principles for global food
security that form the basis of our strategy. In November, all UN member states endorsed these principles at the
World Summit on Food Security in Rome.
1)Invest in country-owned plans
2)Foster strategic coordination
3) Strive for a comprehensive approach to food security
4) Ensure a strong role for the multilateral system
5)Ensure sustained and substantial commitment by all partners to investment in agriculture and food security
and nutrition
In establishing the Rome Principles, the international community declared a new business model for
coordinated action to increase global food security.
Translating these principles into action, on December 6-8, the Government of Rwanda, together with the
Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program, hosted a technical review of its Agriculture Sector
Investment Plan and convened a high-level stakeholders meeting. At the meeting, development partners and the
African Union/NEPAD endorsed Rwanda's plan and agreed to mobilize support for scaled-up financing. The
African Union/NEPAD and representatives from the World Bank, UN, donor countries, the private sector, civil
society organizations, and NGOs attended the meeting.
The United States was represented by a whole-of-government team led by Special Assistant to the President
Gayle Smith that included representatives from the Departments of State, Treasury, and Agriculture, USAID,
and MCC. Our team committed to improve the quality of our aid; to provide robust financial commitments and
technical support; and to work to mobilize additional financing of the Investment Plan.
In the new year, we will continue to engage all 'stakeholders, work with the international community, and build
on our experience in Rwanda as we move forward with plans to implement our initiative.
Please continue to visit our website: www.state.gov/s/globalfoodsecurity to stay informed of planning for the
initiative and to provide input.
We wish you a happy new year and look forward to continuing to work closely with you.

Subject: To Heilemann, Halperin and Politico: I'll Proudly Defend Hillary Clinton, On the Record
The Huffington Post January 12, 2010
Peter Daou
Political consultant, former adviser to Hillary Clinton
Posted: January 12, 2010 11:26 AM
To Heilemann, Halperin and Politico: I'll Proudly
Defend Hillary Clinton, On the Record
Ben Smith writes a cover story for Politico titled Game over: The Clintons stand alone. The piece is based on
John Heilemann and Mark Halperin's 'Game Change', the latest in an ever-expanding series of 2008 campaign
books -- none of which, in my view, capture the entire story of what happened in that historic Democratic
primary. (I include in that assessment David Plouffe's The Audacity to Win, which is undeniably a definitive
version of what transpired inside the Obama campaign from the perspective of an exceptional campaign
manager, but overlooks key reasons for Hillary Clinton's defeat and doesn't articulate the full scope of the
online commentariat's impact.)
I am reading Game Change now and will update this entry once I've completed the portions about Hillary
Clinton but I wanted to post something immediately in response to the Politico story.
Ben Smith is a savvy, well-connected reporter and Heilemann/Halperin are about as plugged into Beltway
culture and DC power centers as anyone can be -- whether that's good or bad I'll let others judge. I became
acquainted with Halperin during the campaign -- and with Smith -- but never spoke to the former about the
book, nor with the latter about his article, so I'm coming to this as an outside observer. I don't dispute that
Heilemann/Halperin have high level sources. I just want to be sure their readers get an accurate picture of
Hillary Clinton's conduct during the campaign.
Smith's Politico article makes the case that the Clintons have few remaining defenders:
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767805 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767805 Date: 08/31/2015
What's notable about the highly publicized release of "Game Change," however, is the virtual silence from the Clinton
camp. The lack of public outrage seems to mark the sputtering end of what was once known as the Clinton political
machine and underlines a fact that onetime Clinton loyalists acknowledge: The book's primary sources about the former
candidate and current secretary of state are her own former staffers and intimates. As a result, there is no campaign of
veteran Clintonites spinning the press corps and trying to pre-emptively discredit the book's scathing depiction of Hillary
Clinton as a rudderless candidate and a cheerleader for vicious tactics against eventual winner Barack Obama.... "Game
Change" peels back a decade of careful renovations off Hillary Clinton's carefully constructed public face, casting her in
the terms that defined her at her lows in the mid-1990s: scheming, profane, sometimes paranoid, often tone-deaf.
Here's my response: as a former adviser and a senior staffer/department head at her presidential campaign, I'll
proudly defend Hillary Clinton and I'll do whatever I can to counter lies, smears and mischaracterizations.
Let me start by recounting how I first got to know her. Nearly four years ago, I was asked by her long-time
communications maven Howard Wolfson to join her senate campaign. I was very happy running my site, the
Daou Report, and advising a number of organizations in the then-nascent field of digital media consulting. I
considered it an honor to be asked, but I knew it was a life-changing decision. Heeding Howard's warning that
once I became part of 'Hillaryland' anything I said or did could become a media story (examples here and here),
I had a series of conversations with people I trusted and whose unique perspective could help me make an
informed decision.
I discussed it first with close friends and family.
I then spoke to Joan Walsh at Salon, who hosted/supported my site and always gave great advice. I spoke to
Arianna Huffington, who openly warned me against giving up the world of blogging to join the Clinton team. I
spoke to David Brock at Media Matters, who had a long history with the Clintons and understood the media
landscape in great depth. I spoke to John Kerry, who I respect deeply and for whom I worked in the bitterly
contested 2004 election. I fought on his behalf when he was trailing badly going into the 2004 primaries, and
after he won the nomination, I lived, worked, ate and slept in his war room for the epic battle against
Bush/Cheney/Rove. He understood and taught me the rigors of a campaign better than anyone I knew. And
because one of my overarching tasks for Clinton was to connect her to the netroots, I spoke to bloggers like
Digby, Markos (Kos) and others to get a sense of the challenge ahead.
In the end, I couldn't miss the once in a lifetime opportunity to work with one of the most dynamic, inspiring
women in the world. And even though the entire focus when I joined her was on the senate campaign, I, like
many others, was looking ahead to the 2008 race. I've blogged for years about the pervasive abuse of women
and the rampant sexism that affects our world, and the idea of electing a woman president was beyond exciting.
Our first meeting was set for 15-30 minutes but lasted over an hour. Contrary to the myth that she was clueless
about the Internet, Hillary was well aware of the importance of technology, of the role of the online community,
and most importantly to me, the value of a strong progressive infrastructure centered around blogs, CAP, Media
Matters and the like. We discussed the Middle East and my childhood in Beirut during Lebanon's bloody civil
war. Not unexpectedly, she knew virtually everything about every topic we discussed. And she was as down to
earth and funny as anyone I'd ever met in politics -- or outside politics.
A week later, fighting flared up in Lebanon. Very early on a Sunday morning, my home phone rang. I answered
groggily. It was Hillary, calling to make sure my friends and family in Beirut were OK. That's the person she is,
the person I encountered throughout the campaign, privately and publicly.
But this is not about psychoanalyzing Hillary Clinton or probing her personal attributes -- others have made a
living doing that. It's not about making her out to be a saint. Nobody is. This is about describing how she ran her
campaign and how she treated her opponents when the cameras and microphones were off.

Was I on every call and at every strategy session? No. Can I vouch for every single thing said and done at the
campaign. Of course not. But having participated in countless senior strategy meetings, crisis management and
rapid response drills and emergencies, "war rooms within war rooms" (a term used by Heilemann/Halperin),
debate prep, calls, emails and private conversations with the candidate, and having slept with my BlackBerry
under my pillow and been stationed at the center of her communications operation for the duration of the
campaign, I can confidently state that Hillary Clinton did not push for 'vicious' or dirty tactics against any of her
opponents, nor did she encourage or 'cheer on' that behavior from her staff. The ethos of the campaign, which
she conveyed in word and deed, was that she would win because she was best prepared, worked the hardest and
had the most compelling ideas.
She was centered, dignified and focused throughout, although her frustration and pain did show through at some
moments. She knew the media environment was stacked against her, against any woman. She knew what she
was up against and drove forward into the furious headwinds of sexism and rightwing-fueled Clinton-hatred.
For Hillary Clinton, it wasn't about being a woman, it was about being the best.
The unraveling of her huge lead in the polls in late 2007 is an incredibly convoluted and harrowing tale of
words, actions, decisions, interpersonal dynamics, internal campaign struggles, dysfinictionality, careless
mistakes, leaks, "surrogates gone wild," (my term for overzealous supporters), reactions, underreactions,
overreactions, strategic/tactical brilliance and incompetence, emotional highs and lows on the part of all the
candidates and campaigns. Anyone who tries to reduce it to a few pivotal moments or to a simple character
narrative does history an injustice. It was literally a minute by minute unfolding, accelerated and complexified
by millions of online activists and commentators, who could shape and reshape conventional wisdom in a
matter of moments. Any single decision could have changed the course of events -- and of history. I have little
tolerance for critics who simplify the whole election as some sort of reflection of the supposedly terrible
character of Bill and Hillary Clinton, conveniently ignoring the Obama campaign's brutally effective hardball
tactics and overlooking the infinite dimensions -- and messiness -- of a presidential image/message war.
The fact is, both campaigns slogged it out, played rough, and one came out victorious. And it would be wrong
to act like only Hillary faced historic obstacles. Barack Obama was a formidable candidate and opponent who
faced almost insurmountable odds. He deserves all the credit for winning and even more credit for appreciating
Hillary's value when the contest ended.
Still, it's important to state for the record, contra Game Change (or at least Politico's interpretation of the book),
that if anything, Hillary's campaign let her down, not the reverse. Nor was it just one person's fault. Her entire
senior team bears responsibility. I take responsibility for the role I played. It's easy to demean her when you're
an anonymous source for a book (and an easy way to absolve oneself of guilt), but let's get real: far too often,
she carried the campaign through sheer force of will and through an endless wellspring of personal fortitude.
Nobody wants to relive 2008, but history is being written now. Generations from today, students will read about
a historic campaign where barriers were shattered, and I for one, don't want the wrong story to be told.

Inside the Reid eruption
By Mike Allen & Glenn Thrush I 1/12/10 @ 12:19 AM EST
Harry Reid isn't talkative. But the Senate majority leader chatted freely with the two disarmingly charming book authors
who came to his office at the Capitol shortly after the 2008 election.
They — and their tape recorder — were soaking in his reminiscences about the wild campaign that had turned a
backbencher in his caucus into president of the United States.
Reid wasn't on guard — perhaps because he'd been told by his staff that the meeting would be "off the record,"
according to a person with knowledge of the exchange.
Although Reid is a master of the Senate's mysterious inside game, he's often botched the outside game because of what
one colleague calls a "penchant for saying things without a filter."
But Jim Manley, Reid's senior communications adviser, wasn't too worried as he and his boss sat down with John
Heilemann of New York Magazine and Mark Halperin of Time magazine — two veteran reporters who were working on
what their publisher had billed as "a sweeping, novelistic, and ultimately definitive portrait" of the 2008 race.
Like virtually every Washington political insider, Manley had a long and warm relationship with Halperin, the longtime
political director for ABC News who once set conventional wisdom in Washington with "The Note."
Maybe Reid and Manley — thinking back to their many candid exchanges over the years — simply assumed that
Halperin wouldn't burn him or his boss. Or maybe he expected that Halperin would check back with him on any quotes
he planned to use?
Whatever they were thinking, they were wrong.
Reid was talking about the reasons why, even though he had publicly professed neutrality in the vicious Democratic
primaries of 2008, he had secretly encouraged then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama to challenge another member of his
caucus, then-New York Sen. Hillary Clinton. And amid all the talk of Obama's oratorical gifts, he let slip something else:
Obama could win the White House because he was a "light-skinned" African-American "with no Negro dialect, unless he
wanted to have one."
The authors write in "Game Change," published this weekend, that Reid had made the remark "privately." They did not
say he had said it to them.
As a chagrined Reid telephoned political allies in the Senate and civil rights community to shore up his support this
weekend, he made it clear that he felt burned by the authors.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767821 Date: 08/31/2015
In the book's"Authors' Note," they wrote: "All of our interviews — from those with junior staffers to those with the
candidates themselves — were conducted on a 'deep background' basis, which means we agreed not to identify the
subjects as sources in any way. We believed this was essential to eliciting the level of candor on which a book of this sort
depends."
Heilemann said on MSNBC's "Morning Joe": "We had a very clear agreement with all those sources that our interviews
would be on deep background.... Our ground rules are ... that we won't identify any of our sources as the sources of the
material. But we said to them all very clearly that if they put themselves in scenes of the book, if they were uttering
dialogue to people in the book in part of a scene, that we would identify them as the utterer of those words."
Halperin added: "There's no one we talked to for the book who we burned in any way, or violated any agreement with."
Manley, a Capitol Hill veteran who also had worked for the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, had been responsible for monitoring
the interview and dealing with issues arising from it.
But he didn't tell anyone else in Reid's inner circle about the inflammatory remarks their boss had made; because of his
good relationship with the authors, he assumed that the quotes would never be made public — at least not without his
knowing about it first.
Manley declined comment on this story-- and wouldn't confirm if the interview took place.
On Friday at 10 p.m. — half a year after the interview — The Atlantic's Marc Ambinder e-mailed Reid's staff with
questions about a "light-skinned" candidate without a "Negro dialect."
In the second-guessing that followed, Capitol Hill veterans said there was no way that such inflammatory words from a
Senate majority leader would remain off the record, even if that had been the arrangement.
But because Manley had not sounded an internal alarm, he and the rest of the damage-control squad were caught flat-
footed by Ambinder's e-mail, several people close to the situation told POLITICO.
"They could have had weeks to prepare for this or to try to convince Halperin not to run it," said a Democrat who
participated in some of the damage control.
Now the staff had been blindsided with a revelation that, if mishandled, could be politically fatal. Manley and other
aides worked until 2 a.m. Saturday to draft Reid's carefully written apology, which emphasized his record on African-
American issues.
"I deeply regret using such a poor choice of words," the 90-word statement began.
Later on Saturday, Manley helped lead a counteroffensive, calling White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, a friend
from his days as communications director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, to set up an apology call
between Reid, at home in Searchlight, Nev., and Obama back in Washington.
In a stunning "Statement by the President" e-mailed to reporters at 3:55 p.m. Saturday, Obama said: "Harry Reid called
me today and apologized for an unfortunate comment reported today.... As far as I'm concerned, the book is closed."
Relieved to have the president's solid backing, Reid's aides decided that their toughest challenge would be to prevent
any prominent African-American Democrats from attacking Reid too harshly — or calling for his resignation.

Reid's team correctly anticipated that Republicans would demand his head. Keeping that criticism from becoming a
bipartisan drumbeat was the key. The team calculated that as long as the attacks looked like partisan shouting, Reid
would benefit.
Aides say their boss quickly understood the danger and spent much of Saturday working a call list of about 30 prominent
African-Americans across the country. On the calls, he apologized for his words and argued that the book's main
takeaway should be that he had quietly supported Obama over Clinton, long before those made his feelings public.
Among those he called were the Rev. Al Sharpton; longtime civil rights leader Julian Bond; Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.),
chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus; political consultant and talk-show fixture Donna Brazile; House Majority
Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.); Wade Henderson, CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights; and Hilary Shelton,
director of the NAACP's Washington office.
The extent of the damage to his already shaky reelection chances in Nevada won't be known until November. But by
Monday, Reid believed the Washington storm was passing. From his home in New York, Sen. Chuck Schumer telephoned
Reid in Nevada and offered to organize a letter of support from all the Democratic senators.
Reid decided that was unnecessary. He had confidently concluded that for now, at least, he had won the inside game.

Subject: FW: FINAL 01-13-10 Haiti Talking Points - 0530
Importance: High
There weren't a huge number of updates over the evening, though the phones are getting more active again now. Late
this morning we learned that SYG Ban Ki Moon was in touch with AMB Rice, and told her that there were approximately
100 UN staff still buried under the rubble at MINUSTAH, SYG Ban formally requested
helicopter search and rescue teams. AMB Rice underscored that we need to make getting those SARs a priority.
I'm attaching our draft talking points from about an hour and a half ago; the background sections in particular have
some useful information. Currently, Southcom is conducting aerial reconnaissance of the airport to determine in what
sort of repair it is. The talking points note that several countries and organizations (Dominican Republic, Chile, UK, the
Netherlands, IADB) have offered assistance to Haiti (and info'd us). In addition to those on the list, the Israelis are trying
to send several urban search and rescue teams (some of the team members need help getting visas to transit Miami en
route to Port-au-Prince).
The UN Situation Center is in contact with MINUSTAH's Deputy Force Commander. They have been working to clear a
couple of major streets in Port-au-Prince, as noted in the talking points. They have also reviewed the airport, and their
Deputy Force Commander told the UN Situation Center several hours ago that the airport was functional (in the sense
that the tarmac was intact and planes could physically land).
Oren Anolik, political counselor at the Israeli Embassy, called around 2 a.m. to ask if there were any updates. We had
few updates at that time, other than to let him know that we had learned the damage to southern Haiti was much more
extensive than that in the north.

Cheryl,
You should know that Katie Dowd is working around the clock on Internet Freedom and doing a spectacular job.
In addition, this Haiti texting program (on which my role was little to nothing) was Katie Dowd + Stanton, Caitlin + James
Eberhard (who was at dinner last week and who was woken up in Pakistan) with Katie Dowd playing the key leadership
role. $200K raised so far.

Rashad Hussain, a Muslim and new U.S. envoy, is bridge between two
w rids
By Scott Wilson
Monday, March 1, 2010; A19
Rashad Hussain, President Obama's new special envoy to the Organization of the Islamic Conference, was an
avid high school debater in Plano, Tex., where he grew up.
His debate partner and best friend was a classmate named Josh Goldberg, meaning that at the end of many
tournaments, the judge would announce "Goldberg-Hussain" as the cultural odd couple who had won the
argument. "People got a kick out of it," Hussain said in a recent interview. "We joked that one day we would
have the solution to the peace process." The two remain close friends.
In his new position, Hussain, who is both a Koran scholar and an ardent North Carolina Tar Heels basketball
fan, will be responsible for helping to bridge another cultural divide -- the one in U.S. relations with Muslims
inside and outside the nation's borders.
Since taking office, Obama has adopted an approach to broaden the ways in which the United States engages
the Islamic world, moving from a policy focused mostly on counterterrorism to one that includes partnerships
with Muslim countries and communities in education, health, science and commerce.
Hussain, 31, will be the face of that policy in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, where the Islamic Conference has it
headquarters, and in the other capitals of its 56 member countries. His is an appropriately young face for an
American representative to the world's 1.6 billion Muslims, the majority of whom are younger than he is.
At a time when the United States is fighting two wars in Muslim nations and defending itself against an
enduring terrorist threat, changing perceptions will take time. "The challenge is to continue to communicate that
this is a long-term process," Hussain said. "Sometimes the challenge becomes that people want to focus
exclusively on the political issues, issues that this administration is working very diligently to solve."
Hussain's father, a mining engineer, moved from Bihar, India, to Wyoming in the late 1960s. A few years later,
during a visit to India, he married Hussain's mother, now an obstetrician in Plano.

The family prayed regularly in a mosque not far from the church-heavy city. At about the time he began middle
school, the Persian Gulf War began and, as he recalled, "it was not the easiest time to be named Hussain." But
he said he encountered very little religious persecution during a childhood that featured study, prayer and
basketball -- a passion he shares with the president. Hussain said it is his "dream" to play in one of Obama's
pickup games.
He graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, then enrolled at Harvard University to
pursue a master's degree in Arabic and Islamic studies. An internship after his first year of graduate school with
Rep. Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) cemented his interest in government, and he returned after completing his
degree to work on the House Judiciary Committee and was there on the morning of the attacks of Sept. 11,
2001.
"I experienced firsthand being evacuated from the building, not knowing what was going on, seeing the twin
towers burning on TV as soon as I got into work, not knowing . . . whether there was a plane heading for the
Capitol," he said. "I very much experienced the terror on that day myself."
In the following days, he said, he experienced a "whole set of feelings," from the initial fear of attack to worry
about discrimination against American Muslims. He said he found that compassion, broader than the pockets of
persecution, is often overlooked by Muslims here and abroad.
"A lot is made about American misperceptions about Muslim communities, but there's a lot of misperceptions
that Muslim communities have about the United States," he said. To counter such misunderstandings of Muslim
culture, Hussain cited his wife, whom he said "breaks down a lot of the misperceptions of women in Islam." Isra
Bhatty, a Yale Law School student currently on a Rhodes scholarship, wears the hijab and is an epic Chicago
Bears fan.
Hussain left Capitol Hill to attend Yale Law School. While there, he criticized the trial of Sami al-Arian, a
University of South Florida professor, as "politically motivated persecution." Arian was accused of aiding the
Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization. Hussain, who did not criticize the
charges against Arian, was on a civil liberties panel with Arian's daughter when he made the comment. A jury
acquitted Arian on some charges and deadlocked on others; he eventually pleaded guilty to one count of
conspiracy.
"My extensive writings on this topic make it clear that I condemn terrorism unequivocally in all its forms,"
Hussain said. "I'd be happy to put that against one sentence from 2004 that I believe was taken out of context."
After the 2008 election, Hussain was recruited to the White House counsel's office by Cassandra Butts, a fellow
Tar Heel and Obama's former Harvard Law classmate. He has worked there on national security and new-media
issues and helped inform the administration's Muslim outreach efforts.
Ben Rhodes, Obama's chief foreign policy speechwriter, sought Hussain's counsel last year as he drafted the
president's Cairo address. Hussain said his advice concerned the contributions Muslims have made to American
society and the context behind some of the religious passages. Hussain has memorized the Koran. He prays
daily, often in a room in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building reserved for all faiths.
Hussain traveled in the Middle East after Obama announced his appointment during a Feb. 13 videoconference
at the U.S.-Islamic World Forum in Doha, Qatar. His approach, Hussain said, will be to emphasize to Muslim
countries what "America stands for," including through the partnerships.
"It's clear that we're not going to agree on every single issue," Hussain said. "Our job will be to try to maximize
our areas of agreement and work through our areas of disagreement and come to the best policy."

Ms Mills,
I got your email address in a message from my good friend, Kathleen Townsend, several months ago but have
never wanted to bother you directly. However, as the former head of humanitarian operations at USAID under
Pres. Clinton, I thought it appropriate to commend you and your colleagues on the excellent job that is being
done in the early days of the USG response to the tragedy in Haiti. The deployment of Coast Guard and
SouthComm resources, the immediate organization of an interdepartmental group to coordinate USG efforts,
the deployment of multiple USAID urban search and rescue units as well as a DART, and the ability to make
these decisions without delay is impressive. Managing information flow with early statements by the Pres. and
Sec. followed by your press conference on relief plans effectively focused attention on the US leadership
role. Please pass on my "good job" to whomever has been leading this effort. It's as good as I have seen from
the USG. Let me know if there is anyway I can be of help.

Subject: Note for Secretary
Madam Secretary-
A few very quick notes for your visit here.
-- Chileans of all stripes are still recovering physically and emotionally from
this earthquake.
Bachelet's team initially underestimated the devastation in the affected
area, but have moved quickly in the past 24 hours to restore public order
which remains a major challenge.
While Santiago looks superficially normal, there is still a huge cleanup
effort ahead in the city and emotions are running high. Restoring
services to Concepcion, Maule and the other affected areas will take
weeks if not months. Without electricity there is no water or
telecommunications.
Chileans are proud and reluctant to accept much external support for the
recovery effort. While they have grudgingly opened up to international
offers of assistance, their wish list is short, and limited to very specific
items. I believe they need to be much more expansive in their outreach
to the international community. But this is a hard sell.
With Bachelet, you should express condolences, review current and
pending U.S. support, and seek out her views on how we can be most
helpful moving forward. You should also compliment her on her social
legacy and her record of leadership in the region. If there is time, you

should also seek out her views on how the U.S. should position itself in
the region in the next year.
With Pinera, you should seek out his views on the current crisis
(including the economic impact), and outline U.S. support. He will want
to discuss his plans to support democracy strengthening in the region and
raise his upcoming trip to the U.S.
With the Embassy staff, you should express appreciation for their
herculean 24/7 efforts to track down all Embassy staff, restore Embassy
services, support and locate U.S. citizens throughout Chile, and
coordinate immediate U.S. assistance with the Chilean government.
Many thanks!

UNDP UPDATE ON THE EARTHQUAKE IN HAITI
Casualties and damage from the earthquake are so extensive that overall assessments are still incomplete. UN
assistance to the victims has been complicated by the fact that a significant number of UN personnel, including
UNDP colleagues, serving in the country are unaccounted for. The headquarters of the UN Mission and
peacekeeping operations, MINUSTAH, collapsed in the tremors and many people are still trapped inside.
UNDP Administrator Helen Clark is meeting with the Secretary-General and other senior personnel continually
today and the whole UN system is mobilized to bring the UN team in Haiti all necessary assistance as soon as
possible to assess the damage, loss of life and injuries, and to support the national and international response
efforts.
The building which housed UNDP and a large number of sister agencies - UNFPA, WFP, UNEP and UNIFEM
- was partially damaged, and rescue workers are continuing to search through the rubble. Senior UNDP officials
are in close touch with the Resident Co-ordinator, Kim Bolduc, who is operating out of a MlNUSTAH logistics
base near the airport. She reports that the situation is critical for staff with limited access to food, water,
sanitation and medical attention.
In the coming hours UNDP will be dispatching additional staff, including stress counselors and medical doctors,
as well communications equipment, to Port-au-Prince. Arrangements are also being made to evacuate injured
and non-essential staff out from the country and to care for and assist its many local staff members. Due to the
limited logistics capacity in Haiti, most of the staff and equipment needed will be transiting through the
Dominican Republic. Plans for strengthening the UNDP office in that country are already underway.
Administrator Clark says UNDP will do whatever it can to support its staff in Haiti and to equip them with the
necessary tools to help the Haitian people on what will be a long road to recovery. As a first step she expects a
UN emergency response team lead by UN Office of the Coordinator for Humanitarian Assistance (OCHA) to be
on the ground shortly to help co-ordinate humanitarian relief efforts.

U/S McHale — Per your earlier request, here is some information from IIP related to Haiti:
• SPEAKER PROGRAMS: There are no U.S. Speakers in Haiti at present, and no plans to send any in the near

• WEB SITES: Working in tandem with Katie Dowd and State PA, IIP web support staff used the Content
Management System (CMS) to update the Embassy Haiti web page (http://haiti.usembassy.gov/) with emergency
contact information, a note on U.S. assistance efforts, links to statements from President Obama and Secretary
Clinton, and information on ways global citizens could donate to disaster relief. IIP web editors posted the
information on the America.gov web site (http://www.america.gov/) , with a continually updated "How You Can
Help" list and other items on the Today's Web Picks page, and made it immediately available to our Facebook and
Twitter networks. IIP is also reconfiguring The Americas regional page on America.gov to focus on events in Haiti
and USG assistance efforts to that country, in English, French and Spanish, including statements made by the
President and the Secretary, links to US assistance and relief effort sites (USAID, Coast Guard, Southcom, NGOs and
others), a photo gallery, and articles written by America.gov writers. French and Spanish materials will also be
posted to IIP Facebook and Twitter networks.
• SOCIAL MEDIA: IIP posted America.gov Twitter feeds on the Haiti earthquake starting at 6:10 PM yesterday and
continued posting as USG statements became available (http://twitter.com/americagov). IIP also provided four
Facebook postings on Haiti, including statements from President Obama, Secretary Clinton, and USAID Administrator

We are safe but Port-au-Prince is destroyed. My appartment is gone.
FOKAL is safe fortunately but a few employees had their homes destroyed, like mine. The phones don't work so it is
easier to stay in touch by internet.
The situation is dramatic. the governement is powerless. The Palace, the Parliament, the Ministries, the Minustah are
non operational. We cannot count the dead. is dead and Minustah's headquarters collapsed. We ran out of
medical supplies, water, food for the first reliefs, and then we have to think about reconstruction.
As soon as we can talk I'll call you to talk about specifics.
The hard part is that there have been over 40 repeats after the first tough seism and we don't know if it is over yet.
We keep in touch.

I just received a call from Jim Risen of the NYT. He says there were court documents unsealed this evening regarding
Blackwater and Nissour Square. In the documents, David Farrington, DS agent, claims there was a cover-up by other
RSOs who handled evidence in such a way that they hoped the case would go away. He is writing for tomorrow. We
have an immediate challenge of how to respond this evening for tomorrow's paper and then how to respond tonight or
tomorrow when there is pick-up of the story. This will reverberate in Iraq as well. I assume that we are generally familiar
with what Mr. Farrington said in court. So what is our view of his allegations? Did we investigate what he claimed? What
were our conclusions? I would recommend a one-line response to Risen tonight but we will need more detailed
guidance for tomorrow. Let me know how to proceed and what the facts are.

FOKAL is safe fortunately but a few employees had their homes destroyed, like mine. The phones don't work so it is
easier to stay in touch by internet.
The situation is dramatic. the governement is powerless. The Palace, the Parliament, the Ministries, the Minustah are
non operational. We cannot count the dead. is dead and Minustah's headquarters collapsed. We ran out of
medical supplies, water, food for the first reliefs, and then we have to think about reconstruction.
As soon as we can talk I'll call you to talk about specifics.
The hard part is that there have been over 40 repeats after the first tough seism and we don't know if it is over yet.
We keep in touch.

Subject: BREAKING NEWS -- NYU GRAD STUDENTS FOUND. SAFE, WELL, IN DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, AND ON THEIR
WAY HOME
Cheryl,
I am once again in your debt. Thank you for all the quick and sustained attention you and the State Department gave
this matter.
I owe you.
At least one good ending...
Here's what I am distributing to news organizations:
STATEMENT FROM NYU SPOKESMAN JOHN BECKMAN
"NYU is very pleased to report that we have been in touch with one of the two missing graduate students who were in Haiti. They
are together and safe and well in the Dominican Republic en route back home to the US. Details of their experience are still
emerging, but our understanding is that they were flown out of the airport near Port-au-Prince by the Coast Guard, whose men and
women we thank for their courage and perseverance.
"The University is very grateful for all the assistance we received from the State Department and other government agencies and
elected officials.
"We're overjoyed to know they are coming home, safe and sound. This is a very happy ending to this story."

I wasn't going to bother you; little surprise that, nonetheless, this matter made its way to you...
Just so you know, Walter and I are old friends; he's married to a really close friend of mine from high
school, I think the world of them both.
ISOS thinks they can get them out, but we have no communication with the two of them, so no way to
arrange a rendezvous. They're history PhD students; they were supposed to be conducting research in
the Haitian National Archives. Their accommodations are not entirely clear — they were either at a
home in Carrefour district that belonged to the family of the young woman, or they may have been
staying in one of the two hotels recommended to them by other grad students who had studied there:
the Plaza, or the Oloffson.
We'd be grateful for anything the Dept can do. I know what a mess it is down there, and I know there
are a zillion tasks to accomplish. I also know this must be very hard on the State Dept personnel who
are posted there; my thoughts are with them.
Thanks, C. Just knowing you know about it is a relief to me
Yours,
jb

State Department Investigating LGBT Treatment In Uganda and Throughout
Africa
Posted: 03 Mar 2010 11:01 PM PST
Last January, we reported that Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) wrote to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and US Trade
Representative Ron Kirk, asking them to "communicate immediately to the Ugandan government, and President Yoweri
Museveni directly, that Uganda's beneficiary status under AGOA (African Growth and Opportunity Act) will be revoked should
the proposed legislation be enacted." The legislation he's referring to, of course, is the draconian Anti-Homosexuality Bill that
is, as far as we are able to determine, awaiting its second reading before Parliament.
The State Department has now responded to Sen. Wyden's request. In a letter dated Feb 22, 2010 and released by Sen.
Wyden's office, Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs Richard Verma responded that the department is not only
"identified this issue as a priority in our bilateral relationship" with Uganda (PDF: 112KB/2 pages):
We have reached out at the highest levels; Secretary Clinton and Assistant Secretary for African Affairs
Johnnie Carson have discussed our concerns directly with President Museveni. In addition, our embassy in
Kampala has been in close and regular contact with key political, media and civil society actors on the
ground in Uganda, registering strong opposition to the bill and warning the Ugandans of potential
consequences if it passes. The ambassador reiterated our concerns with President Museveni as recently as
January 25, and Under Secretary for Democracy and Global Affairs Maria Otero just visited Uganda on
January 29. She met and offered support and encouragement to civil society groups opposed to the
legislation and underscored our views to senior Ugandan officials. We are following this bill very closely.
In Museveni's remarks urging Parliament to 'go slow" on considering the draconian legislation, ne cited a long conversation
with Secretary Clinton in declaring that the bill was not just a domestic issue but also had foreign policy considerations.
Assistant Secretary Verma characterized Uganda's proposed bill "a serious affront to internationally accepted human rights
standards." And interestingly, the State Department's concerns aren't limited to Uganda:
The State Department is also evaluating attitudes and laws that marginalize and criminalize and penalize the
LGBT community in Africa more broadly. We have asked all of our embassies in Africa to report on host
country laws and pending legislation that criminalizes homosexuality. In addition, our Bureau of
Democracy, Human Rights and Labor has established a task force on LGBT issues to strategize a United
States Government response to LBGT issues worldwide.

Dear Hillary and all.
; Mills, Cheryl D B6
We arrived at the general hospital last night with 1500 people sick or dying with 40 percent needing surgery. It has no
water electricity or food and very limited surgical suites or supplies It the largest and most well known public hospital in
the city and according to PIH and paul farmer needs to be supported and it's infrastucture needs to be rebuilt.
Right now we have surgeons but not enough operating rooms set up. We
desperately need to get a generator and fuel and surgical lights and surgery supplies not just first aid. There are
hundreds including children with festering wounds needing amputation and emergency
surgical care. The doctors nurses and patients have no food or water.
Can you help get the infrastructure of electricity water and a medical hospital tent for post op patients. We are
operating with headlamps and hacksaws rinsed with alcohol.
If we have the electricity and water we can open 11 operating rooms tomorrow if we get what we need. Can the
military help ASAP and for security of equipment and medication.
Until this morning when
none at the General.
did the first amuptation there was almost no surgery happening at all here in the city and
Five days after the quake with no acute surgical care wounds are
festering patients are getting septic and dying. If we had a little
help with basic servcices we could stop this.
I don't have cell or email at the hospital. Please coordinate with Claire Pierre or Nancy from PIH.
Thank you thank you thank you.

Subject: RE:
The Program would be Chairman Kerry to Lugar to WJC to Gates. Statements followed by questions from the Senators.
They would expect nearly every Senator would attend if WJC confirmed. The topic of the hearing is "Building on
Success: New Directions in Global Health" Also testifying after WJC / Gates would be a second panel of Second Panel:
USAID Administrator Dr. Rajiv Shah and U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator, Ambassador Eric Goosby. They would like WIC to
speak on the public / private partnerships, where the US and Intl Community is, the importance of our work Because bi-
partisan coalition on HIV/AIDS is becoming increasingly fragile with the poor economy.
Goals of the hearing from the committee:
The objective of the hearing is to discuss the progress that has been made in global health and to ask where we should
go from here. How do we build on remarkable but sometimes compartmentalized successes? Questions for
consideration include:
What are the key opportunities and challenges?
In a constrained budget environment, how can public and private partners maximize the life-saving impact and cost
effectiveness of health programs?
The United States has led the way in supporting path-breaking bilateral and multilateral HIV/AIDS programs. How can
we best maintain and expand that work while creating a more holistic and integrated approach to global health?
What does it mean in practical terms to focus on women and girls and how can this approach yield new results?
Health systems are more than the sum of their parts. How can public and private partners most effectively help
countries create the capacity to deliver health service

Cheryl,
Local media drew attention this weekend to the line in the introduction of our annual human rights report that
refers to the GOH by saying that there is severe corruption in all branches of government, called this morning
asking for a copy of the report (which we sent him), saying that the President was upset and wanted to read it. The
Embassy human rights officer sent the Department a first draft of this report late last year. It normally would have gone
through two or three more versions with input from DRL and ultimately clearance by the Embassy Front Office. Because
our Human Rights officer (Kathey-Lee Galvin) was seriously injured in the quake, DRL took it upon themselves to finish
the report. The final draft was never sent to us for clearance/comments and I don't know who all in the Department
cleared off on it. You may already be familiar with the report, but in the event you are not, I wanted you to have a copy
in advance of meetings in Santo Domingo where you may hear about it from Cheers, David

complete rebuild - neither are great numbers based on analysis so work cont)
- discussion and presentation of both dev authority and MDTF (which is open for contributions now and will be
administered by WB with support from IDB)
- bellerive or preval to announce wjc in context of release on dev authority - supposedly today but if preval wants to
announce from Haiti that won't occur until thurs and will drive us all wild so pushing for today
-EC says it will do essentially 100M that is new (rest is 200M being repurposed; 100M - of which 20M is only new - being
repurposed). Of their repurposed money, 40M euros will go to debt support by end of april)
- France will do 70M euros a year for 2 years (upping their traditional annual contrib by SOM euros from 20M euros);
french will do some budget supp
- seeing spain, canada, and pot today
-tentatively seeing cubans today to discuss hospital cooperation proposal they sent as result of craighulissa last trip
-lots of whispering re timing of usg human rts report and a few pointed ques re our motivation on timing given pre-conf
and cont on 31Mar; preval still very upset - will be calling him on thurs as a post conf cony and hear him out
- pressure for budget support on everyone; french pointed out US says it doesnt do budget supp but sends 500M each
year to palestian auth in direct budget support suggesting we will do it when politically expedient for us
- worry about the rains and cont need for shelter (been raining in PauP for last 3 days).

Fw: THANKS to Team Pledge Data
See bottom of message re the firsts.
These were innovations we pushed (particularly use of web for real time display of pledges and what initially was
described by those who did not like my idea as pay to play (or in this instance as I argued - it was pay to have a priority
speaking slot as those who did not have a pledge would get to speak, just not until the end).
Nice addition to our innovation and tech storyline.

Subject: THANKS to Team Pledge Data
Dear members of Team Pledge Data,
Jordan Ryan < ; Mills, Cheryl D; Klevorick, Caitlin B;
I wanted to thank all of you for your excellent work leading up and at the Conference in establishing the system for
gathering, scrubbing, presenting, projecting, and posting the pledge data from all the donors. And to thank you for
accommodating so quickly my inchoate and sleep-deprived requests yesterday morning for the changes to the format of
what was projected.
But I wanted to make sure you realized that you accomplished something rather historic yesterday. You have
massively raised the bar for future donors' conference on how pledge data should be tracked and shared.
Here are some of the "firsts" that you should be proud of (based at least on my experience in 8 major donors'
conferences so far):
First to gather written pledges from all donors
- First to project individual pledges in real time at the conference
- First to release individual pledges to the world public and media on the same day as the conference
In addition to these, the work that you put into scrubbing the pledges — with the rigor and integrity of development
professionals — ensured that the pledge figures were more meaningful and accurate than for most other pledging
conferences (another possible first).

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768034 Date: 08/31/2015
All of these achievements are great in themselves, but they will be most important in their impact on ensuring that the
pledged assistance actually makes in to the people of Haiti. This is really just the beginning of that important effort, and
you will be playing a critical role in it — but you have set us off with the best possible starting point for that effort.
Thank you again. It has been and will remain for me a pleasure for me to work with you. Best regards, Roland
Please pass this on to others on the team that I have missed in this email.

Thank you so much Cheryl and no you did not! The conference looked great yesterday and the read out, congrats to all
of you for a great event. On the video, just hope it got to a point where you were happy with it. That said, I also wanted
to say that the streaming on State.gov and America.gov went very well yesterday and received a lot more praise then
the UN one which required people to download software, which ours did not. :)
Also, we are working now to send the video out to posts and to let them use in their own story telling. Also, we had a
gadget created to help promote the event which has been featured on several sites and we are continuing to push out
which encourages people to keep up to date on news on Haiti and to donate to the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund.

Subject: Passing of Dr. Peter Andrew Kraemer
The Office of the Historian is saddened to announce the premature passing of Dr. Peter Andrew Kraemer on
April 7, 2010
Dr. Kraemer joined the office in August 2004 as a historian producing volumes in the Foreign Relations of the
United States series, the official documentary history of U.S. foreign policy. He worked on volumes on South
Asia, Eastern Europe, and national security policy. He regularly lectured in the Foreign Service Institute's A-
100 orientation course for Foreign Service Officers. In November 2009, he made a video appearance on the
Department's DipNote blog, where he spoke about the rise and fall of the Berlin Wall. In January 2009, he
participated in an on-the-ground lessons learned project in Iraq, conducting oral history interviews on the nature
of civil-military cooperation.
In addition to his work at the Office of the Historian, Dr. Kraemer was a Professorial Lecturer in History at The
George Washington University, where he taught a course on the political, social, and cultural techniques that
create historical narratives. In years past, he taught History and American Studies at Indiana University and
Indiana University-Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin; served as an editorial assistant at the Journal of American
History; and worked as an oral historian at Indiana University's Oral History Research Center and the U.S.
Holocaust Memorial Museum. He was an active member of a number of professional organizations, including
the American Historian Association, the Organization of American Historians, the Society for Historians of
American Foreign Relations, and the Society for History in the Federal Government.
Dr. Kraemer completed his Ph.D. in History and American Studies at Indiana University in 2004, where he
wrote a dissertation entitled, "Germany is Whose Problem?: American Philanthropy and the German Question,
1944-1964." He took his M.A. in History from Indiana University and his B.A. in History and German at
Dickinson College.

Colleagues, the latest from Amb. Feinstein of Embassy Warsaw. In short, the crash took the lives of many of Poland's
senior civilian and military leadership; succession/transition will be the first major test of Poland's constitution. The

constitution requires he call for presidential elections within 14 days and that elections take place within 60 days. An

Subject: Poland Sitrep
All,
This is going out as a cable momentarily. The main point is that the crash killed not only the President and his wife but a
broad swath of Poland's top national security leadership. In this sense it is an unprecedented governmental tragedy,
and a test of Poland's constitution. The sitrep follows.
Shortly before 1000 Warsaw time, a Polish government Tu-154 plane carrying a delegation headed by Polish President
Lech Kaczynski crashed in heavy fog at the airport in Smolensk, Russia. Russian officials have told the press that there
were no survivors; the foreign ministry spokesman said there were 88 passengers on board. The delegation was en
route to ceremonies hosted by the Russian government to commemorate the 70t1, anniversary of the Katyn
massacres. There is as yet not government confirmation of the deaths, but there is no expectation of survivors.
Speaker of the Polish Sejm (the lower house of parliament) Bronislaw Komorowski is en route to Warsaw to take over
the powers of the presidency and those of the Commander in Chief, according to press reports. According to the Polish
constitution, if the president dies in office, the Speaker temporarily assumes the presidency, and has 14 days to
announce the date of special presidential elections. The elections must be held within 60 days of his
announcement. This is the first major test of the Polish constitution, and the government is itself sorting out the details
of the procedure in this unprecedented circumstance.
Prime Minister Tusk is returning from Gdansk to Warsaw, and will chair a meeting of the Council of Ministers at 1P local
time. Tusk has received condolence telephone calls from Russian Prime Minister Putin, German Chancellor Angela
Merkel, and other world leaders.

The magnitude of the loss is difficult to overstate including, in addition to the President and the First Lady, the top
national security leadership of the Presidential Chancellery, the head of Poland's armed forces, all or nearly all of
Poland's military chiefs, a deputy minister of defense, a deputy foreign minister, a presidential candidate, and members
of Parliament. Crowds of people with candles and flowers have started to assemble in front of the presidential palace in
downtown Warsaw. A mass in honor of those who died will be held later this afternoon. Poland is in shock and entering
a period of deep national mourning.
Below is an unofficial and incomplete manifest of those who are on the plane. Among them are:
President Lech Kaczynski
First Lady Maria Kaczynska
Former President Ryszard Kaczorowski

Subject: Frank Views: QDDR -- Prevention and Complex Crisis Response
Dear Jack, Anne-Marie and Jim:
Without prejudice to the deliberative process now underway, I owe you my unvarnished and
very frank views on the QDDR process -- and how the U.S. Government must best organize
itself to anticipate and respond effectively to crisis and conflicts. The stakes are huge, and
because we are at the point where the working group I co-chair on this issue has to generate
recommendations, this is the time for me to offer some basic perspectives directly to you --
informed by my experiences working on these issues at the NSC, at State, at the United Nations
and in the NGO community, as well as writing and teaching about them over the course of the
last decade. The QDDR process itself has also impacted my perspectives and, more
importantly, raised serious concerns for me about mistakes we must avoid.
I also realize that current bureaucratic and political realities may impose limitations (or compel
adjustments) to the kinds of organizational arrangements we might make. But the starting point
for me is what makes the most sense.
My propositions:

Subject: HRC meeting with the IMF?
Cheryl, Jake,
I received a call from Masood Ahmed, Director of the Middle East Department at the IMF. Apparently at the Haiti
meeting in NYC, the Secretary had a conversation with IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn in which she
expressed an interest in meeting with him to discuss the IMF's work in Haiti and other places.
A few weeks earlier, apparently she talked briefly with Mr. Ahmed at a meeting about Pakistan, and also expressed an
interest in meeting with the IMF to discuss their work.
The Managing Director would be very happy to meet with her. But I think they wanted to know whether she was really
interested in meeting, or whether she was being diplomatic and polite. For what it's worth, I think a meeting could be
very useful. Someone from Treasury would want to sit in.
How should I respond to them?
Thanks.

US troops withdrawing en masse from Haiti BEN FOX,Associated Press Writers JENNIFER KAY,Associated Press Writers
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) 91U.S. troops are withdrawing from the shattered capital, leaving many Haitians anxious
that the most visible portion of international is ending even as the city is still mired in misery and vulnerable to unrest.
As troops packed their duffels and began to fly home this weekend, Haitians and some aid workers wondered whether
U.N. peacekeepers and local police are up to the task of maintaining order. More than a half-million people still live in
vast encampments that have grown more unpleasant in recent days with the early onset of rainy season.
Some also fear the departure of the American troops is a sign of dwindling international interest in the plight of the
Haitian people following the catastrophic Jan. 12 earthquake.
"I would like for them to stay in Haiti until they rebuild the country and everybody can go back to their house," said
Marjorie Louis, a 27-year-old mother of two, as she warmed a bowl of beans for her family over a charcoal fire on the
fake grass of the national stadium.
U.S. officials say the long-anticipated draw down of troops is not a sign of waning commitment to Haiti, only a change in
the nature of the operation. Security will now be the responsibility of the 10,000-strong U.N. peacekeeping force and
the Haitian police.
A smaller number of U.S. forces 11 the exact number has not yet been determined 11 will be needed as the U.N. and
Haitian government reassert control, said Gen. Douglas Fraser, head of U.S. Southern Command, which runs the Haiti
operation.
"Our mission is largely accomplished," Fraser said.
American forces arrived in the immediate aftermath of the quake to treat the wounded, provide emergency water and
rations and help prevent a feared outbreak of violence among desperate survivors. They also helped reopen the airport
and seaport.
There has been no widespread violence but security is a real issue. A U.N. food convoy traveling from Gonaives to
Dessalines on Friday was stopped and overrun by people, who looted two trucks before peacekeepers regained control,
U.N. officials said.
They managed to escort the other two back to Gonaives. There were no reports of injuries.

The military operation was criticized by some Haitian senators and foreign leaders as heavy-handed and inappropriate in
a country that had been occupied by American forces for nearly two decades in the early 20th century. But ordinary
Haitians largely welcomed the troops, many out of disenchantment with their own government.
"They should stay because they have been doing a good job," 35-year-old Lesly Pierre said as his family prepared dinner
under a tarp at an encampment in Petionville. "If it was up to our government, we wouldn't have gotten any help at all."
U.S. soldiers said they had nothing but warm encounters with the Haitian people.
"They're real good people. They just want help," Army Private First Class Troy Sims, a 19-year-old from Fresno,
California, said as he prepared to board a flight back to the U.S. "I feel that us being here helped a lot. If we weren't
here, things probably would have gotten out of control."
There are now about 11,000 troops, more than half of them on ships just off the coast, down from a peak of around
20,000 on Feb. 1. The total is expected to drop to about 8,000 in coming days as the withdrawal gathers steam. The
military said more than 700 paratroopers left this weekend.
Soldiers are now gone from the General Hospital, where they once directed traffic and kept order amid the chaos of
mass casualties. There are no more Haitian patients on board the USNS Comfort, which treated 8,600 people after the
quake. At a country club in Petionville, where some 100,000 Haitians are living in rough shelters in a muddy ravine, only
a few soldiers remain of the several hundred there after the disaster.
Alison Thompson said she was nervous about the smaller U.S. troop contingent.
"Soon we are not going to have any security," said Thompson, medical coordinator of the Jenkins/Penn Relief
Organization, which runs a field hospital at the edge of the ravine. "Everybody is just so worried that they are pulling out
because it's going to get dangerous."
It was the same concern for Louis at the national stadium.
"If the troublemakers see that there is some kind of force here, they will think twice before they do anything," she said.
"They are already getting ready to stir up trouble."
But Ted Constan, chief program officer for Partners in Health, said that the way to address security is to get adequate
shelter and other aid to the hundreds of thousands of people who are now stranded in squalid encampments.
"The real solution is to deliver services ... rather than turn Haiti into a military state," he said.

ENGEL OFFERS STRONG SUPPORT FOR
ENERGY AND CLIMATE PARTNERSHIP OF THE AMERICAS
Washington, DC--Congressman Eliot Engel, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the
Western Hemisphere, issued the following statement today to recognize the Energy and Climate Ministerial of
the Americas, held on April 15-16 in Washington DC.
"I would like to offer my strong support for the Energy and Climate Ministerial of the Americas being held
today at the Inter-American Development Bank and at the Organization for American States on April 16. I
attended the Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and Tobago in April 2009 when President Obama announced
the Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas (ECPA) to address the energy and climate change
challenges facing the region. The challenges are many as seen in frequent blackouts in major cities in the
region and the lack of access to electricity in the rural countryside. Energy poverty, energy inefficiency and
poor infrastructure have a direct impact on economic growth and development in many countries.
"The Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas is an effort to address these issues head on. But it's not
an initiative that places the United States in a role in which it provides all the assistance or direction. It's
innovative since it sets up a voluntary and flexible framework that is open to governments, private industry, and
civil society to lead or participate in initiatives that reflect their priorities. Many countries in the Western
Hemisphere such as Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, and Canada plan on leading initiatives under ECPA. El
Salvador, Chile, Costa Rica and Trinidad and Tobago will set up Clean Energy Technology Centers to serve as
sources of expertise on renewable energy technologies.
"I applaud the efforts of the representatives of the 32 countries and over 200 businesses and civil society
organizations attending the Energy and Climate Ministerial of the Americas. Many initiatives will be
announced during the Ministerial. It's impressive to see the fast progress on ECPA since President Obama
announced it last year. This is clearly a sign of the new relationship that the Obama Administration would like
with the countries of the Western Hemisphere - an inclusive one based on partnership and focused on pragmatic
problem solving and not political posturing. I plan on working with President Obama, Secretary of State
Clinton, and Energy Secretary Steven Chu to make sure the goals and priorities of the Energy and Climate
Partnership of the Americas are met."

You may already be aware of this, but in the event you aren't: A Spanish helicopter based on their Navy ship "Castilla"
disappeared in a mountainous region near the Dominican border shortly before noon. The Spanish Embassy called us,
and JTF scrambled a helo. Chilean MINUSTAH helo had also been dispatched. The Spanish helo apparently crashed and
burned in an area where rescue helos could not land, so a JTF helo landed in the closest area and US troops with
stretchers hiked in. On arrival, they reported that the crew of four had all been killed. We are getting body bags into
the site now and will remove the bodies today. This is the first fatality involving foreign troops engaged in earthquake
response.

Gen! Keen,
The Spanish Ambassador just called to express his government's gratitude for the U.S. rescue/recovery efforts regarding
the helicopter. I told him all credit was due to my colleagues in the U.S. military and that I would pass along his thanks to

Somalia Food Aid Bypasses Needy, U.N. Study Says
By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN and NEIL MacFARQUHAR
As much as half the food aid sent to Somalia is diverted from needy people to a web of corrupt contractors, radical Islamist militants
and local United Nations staff members, according to a new Security Council report.
The report, which has not yet been made public but was shown to The New York Times by diplomats, outlines a host of problems so
grave that it recommends that Secretary General Ban Ki-moon open an independent investigation into the World Food Program's
Somalia operations. It suggests that the program rebuild the food distribution system — which serves at least 2.5 million people and
whose aid was worth about $485 million in 21309 — from scratch to break what it describes as a corrupt cartel of Somali distributors.
In addition to the diversion of food aid, regional Somali authorities are collaborating with pirates who hijack ships along the lawless
coast, the report says, and Somali government ministers have auctioned off diplomatic visas for trips to Europe to the highest bidders,
some of whom may have been pirates or insurgents.
Somali officials denied that the visa problem was widespread, and officials for the World Food Program said they had not yet seen the
report but would investigate its conclusions once it was presented to the Security Council next Tuesday.
The report comes as Somalia's transitional government is preparing for a major military offensive to retake the capital, Mogadishu, and
combat an Islamist insurgency with connections to Al Claeda.
The United States is providing military aid, as the United Nations tries to roll back two decades of anarchy in the country.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768514 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768514 Date: 08/31/2015
But it may be an uphill battle. According to the report, Somalia's security forces "remain ineffective, disorganized and corrupt — a
composite of independent militias loyal to senior government officials and military officers who profit from the business of war."
One American official recently conceded that Somalia's "best hope" was the government's new military chief, a 60-year-old former
artillery officer who, until a few months ago, was assistant manager at a McDonald's in Germany.
The report's investigators, part of the Monitoring Group on Somalia, were originally asked to track violations of the United Nations
arms embargo on Somalia, but the mandate was expanded.
Several of the report's authors have received death threats, and the United Nations recently relocated them from Kenya to New York for
safety reasons.
Possible aid obstructions have been a nettlesome topic for Somalia over the past year and have contributed to delays in aid shipments by
the American government and recent suspensions of food programs in some areas by United Nations officials.
The report singles out the World Food Program, the largest aid agency in the crisis-racked country, as particularly flawed.
"Some humanitarian resources, notably food aid, have been diverted to military uses," the report said. "A handful of Somali contractors
for aid agencies have formed a cartel and become important power brokers — some of whom channel their profits, or the aid itself,
directly to armed opposition groups."
These allegations of food aid diversions first surfaced last year. The World Food Program has consistently denied finding any proof of
malfeasance and said that its own recent internal audit found no widespread abuse.
"We have not yet seen the U.N. Somalia Monitoring Group report," the World Food Program's deputy executive director, Amir Abdulla,
said Tuesday. "But we will investigate all of the allegations, as we have always done in the past if questions have been raised about our
operations."
The current report's investigators question how independent that past audit was, and called for a new outside investigation of the
United Nations agency.
"We have to tell these folks that you cannot go on like this — we know what you are doing, you can't fool us anymore, so you better
stop," said President Ali Bongo Ondimba of Gabon, who was at the United Nations, where his country holds the presidency of the
Security Council this month.
The report also charges that Somali officials are selling spots on trips to Europe and that many of the people who are presented as part
of an official government entourage are actually pirates or members of militant groups.
The report says that Somali officials use their connections to foreign governments to get visas and travel documents for people who
would not otherwise be able to travel abroad and that many of these people then disappear into Europe and do not come back.
"Somali ministers, members of Parliament, diplomats and 'freelance brokers' have transformed access to foreign visas into a growth
industry, matched possibly only by piracy," selling visas for $10,000 to $1.5,000 each, the report said.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768514 Date: 08/31/2015
The report's authors estimate that dozens, if not hundreds of Somalis have gained access to Europe or beyond through this under-the-
table visa business.
Mohamed Osman Aden, a Somali diplomat in Kenya, said: "Maybe there's been one or two cases that have happened over the years. But
these are just rumors. These allegations have been going around for years."
The report also takes aim at some of Somalia's richest, most influential businessmen, Somalia's so-called money lords. One, Abdulkadir
M. Nur, known as Eno, is married to a woman who plays a prominent role in a local aid agency that is supposed to verify whether food
aid is actually delivered. That "potential loophole" could "offer considerable potential of large-scale diversion," the report said.
The report accuses Mr. Nur of staging the hijacking of his own trucks and later selling the food.
In an e-mail message, Mr. Nur said he had sent the investigators many documents that "showed very clearly that the gossip and rumors
they are investigating are untrue," including the alleged hijacking or any link to insurgents. He said that his wife merely sat on the board
of the local aid agency and that only "a tiny fraction" of the food he transported was designated for that aid agency.
In September, Somalia's president, Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed, wrote a letter to Secretary General Ban, defending Mr. Nur as a "very
conscientious, diligent and hard-working person" and saying that if it were not for the contractors, "many Somalis would have
perished."
The report questions why the World Food Program would steer 80 percent of its transportation contracts for Somalia, worth about
$200 million, to three Somali businessmen, especially when they are suspected of connections to Islamist insurgents.
The report says that fraud is pervasive, with about 30 percent of aid skimmed by local partners and local World Food Program
personnel, io percent by the ground transporters and 5 to io percent by the armed group in control of the area. That means as much as
half of the food never makes it to the people who desperately need it.
In January, the United States halted tens of millions of dollars of aid shipments to southern Somalia because of fears of such diversions,
and American officials believe that some American aid may have fallen into the hands of Al Shabab, the most militant of Somalia's
insurgent groups.
The report also said that the president of Puntland, a semiautonomous region in northern Somalia, had extensive ties to pirates in the
area, who then funneled some of the money they made from hijacking ships to authorities.
Puntland authorities could not be reached on Tuesday, but Mr. Aden, the Somali diplomat, dismissed the allegations, saying that the
Puntland government had jailed more than io pirates and that it had not "received a penny from them."
"It's unfortunate that this monitoring group thinks they can stick everything on the Somalis," he said.
Jeffrey Gettleman reported from Gisenyi, Rwanda, and Neil MaeFarquhar from New York.

IDB Approves $70 Billion Capital Increase, Forgives Haitian Debt
The governors of the Inter-American Development Bank early Monday approved a $70 billion capital increase for the
multilateral lender and also agreed to forgive $479 million of Haitian debt, Reuters reported. Colombian Finance Minister
Oscar Zuluaga announced the move at the close of an IDB governors meeting in Candin. Last week, Moody's Investor
Services affirmed the bank's long-standing Aaa credit rating, the IDB said.

I know we all want to ensure a smooth transition — I think it might make sense for you Bob to meet with both Phil and
then with Steve and determine a timeline and process and then to brief you and me on that transition.
If that makes sense, I would encourage Bob to meet with Phil and with Steve. We then can determine once there is a

Administration should include education assistance in supplemental
funding request for Haiti, Lugar says
Getting Haitian children back in classrooms should be a priority in U.S. assistance to Haiti, U.S. Sen. Dick
Lugar said today after attending the White House Rose Garden ceremony with President Barack Obama hosting
Haitian President René Preval. Earlier in the day, former President Bill Clinton also told the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee that this should be a priority.
"As the Administration prepares to present its supplemental appropriations request for Haiti;a top priority for
recovery and long term reconstruction efforts in Haiti should include significant assistance to get Haitian
children quickly back into the classroom," Lugar said. "Assistance for infrastructure, technical assistance for
instruction and curriculum development especially should be included. Only with a strong education initiative

Lugar directed two staff members to accompany a Congressional Delegation to Haiti on Friday, March 5.
During the visit, staff saw firsthand the devastation experienced by Haitians and reported to Lugar that
thousands of schools in and around Port au Prince could remain closed for months or never reopen. As a result,
Haitian children could be left languishing in refugee camps. Before the January 12 earthquake approximately
one-half of Haiti's school-age children were enrolled in classes. Children make up about 45 percent of Haiti's
population.
"The relationship between the United States and the Haitian government should be a consensual, cooperative
arrangement that preserves Haitian participation in decisions, while ensuring that the resources and expertise of
the United States Government and international community are brought to bear on the daily problems of Haiti.
Education of the Haiti's youth is an appropriate starting point," Lugar said.

Subject: Mission Corrections: Bhutto Assassination
Under Secretary McHale:
This week we have seen the most extraordinary series of public attacks on the United States by Lt Gen (ret) Hamid Gul, a
noted anti-American crackpot who derives his role as an "expert analyst" by being the only former Inter-Services
Intelligence (1St) Chief who ever appears on TV. Gul was briefly 151 chief during PM Bhutto's first term in office almost 20
years ago. Appearing on several TV stations this week, Gut has repeated allegations that the U.S. is implicated in the
Bhutto Assassination —the subject is current this week because of the release of the U.N. report on the assassination,
which is itself a remarkable document.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768592 Date: 08/31/2015
One ironic element of the UN report on the assassination is the report that on October 16, 2007 former PM Bhutto
wrote to General Musharraf that the very same Hamid Gul was one of three people she considered a threat to
her security. (see excerpt below) This fact came up in none of the programs.
Our view is that the television journalists and executives now must begin taking responsibility for putting
inciting and unsubstantiated claims on the air. We have released the attached "Correction," which will be
seen by news editors across the country.

Excerpt from the UN report on the Bhutto assassination:
179. On 16 October 2007, Ms Bhutto writing from Dubai to General Musharraf identified three people she
considered a threat to her security: (z) Brigadier (ret) Ejaz Shah, Director General of the IB at the time of the
assassination, (ii) General (ret) Hamid Gul, a former Director General of the IS1, and (iii) Mr Chaudhry
Pervaiz Elahi, Chief Minister of Punjab until 22 November 2007.

It's our understanding that the review of the terrorist list undertaken at the beginning of the year is reaching
completion, imminently. Jim asked me to shoot you a note that this continues to be a very important issue for
him and Bill Delahunt. The list needs to be purged of political manipulation — and quite frankly, the current
status quo with Cuba needs to be broken, not further reinforced — for the sake of Alan Gross, those on the island
needing space to voice their views, and indeed, all of us outside who know change is coming.
It's time to do something bold and constructive — and in our very best interests —
Let us know if there's anything we can do to help —

Hillary and Cheryl,
I'm feeling very good about our recent efforts to connect our speeches thematically. We've done it with development,
human rights, and Internet freedom; and most recently with AIPAC, Ctr for Middle East Peace, and next the AJC. Here's
what I want to suggest: The three most basic elements of human existence are food, water, and health. We have now
done major speeches on food and water. I'd like us to consider a major speech on global health —the third in a
trilogy. Linking these three issues thematically, we can explain how and why foreign policy challenges and solutions
must be seen through a prism of human survival and why the conditions of people's lives influence everything from
economic development to political stability and more. This trilogy of speeches (with the right PR) could further
underscore our elevation of development AND our comprehensive, smart power approach to foreign policy. After
all, food, water, and health are the sine qua non of human progress. And this is a Hillary Clinton signature idea, at least
to me. Thoughts?

FYI

Op-Ed Columnist
Obama Backs Down on Sudan
By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF
JUBA, Sudan
Until he reached the White House, Barack Obama repeatedly insisted that the United States apply more pressure on
Sudan so as to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe in Darfur and elsewhere.
Yet, as president, Mr. Obama and his aides have caved, leaving Sudan gloating at American weakness. Western
monitors, Sudanese journalists and local civil society groups have all found this month's Sudanese elections to be deeply
flawed - yet Mr. Obama's special envoy for Sudan, Maj. Gen. Scott Gration, pre-emptively defended the elections, saying
they would be "as free and as fair as possible." The White House showed only a hint more backbone with a hurried
reference this week to "an essential step" with "serious irregularities."
President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan - the man wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against
humanity in Darfur - has been celebrating. His regime calls itself the National Congress Party, or N.C.P., and he was
quoted in Sudan as telling a rally in the Blue Nile region: "Even America is becoming an N.C.P. member. No one is against
our will."
Memo to Mr. Obama: When a man who has been charged with crimes against humanity tells the world that America is
in his pocket, it's time to review your policy.
Perhaps the Obama administration caved because it considers a flawed election better than no election. That's a
reasonable view, one I share. It's conceivable that Mr. Bashir could have won a quasi-fair election - oil revenues have
manifestly raised the standard of living in parts of Sudan - and the campaigning did create space for sharp criticism of
the government.
It's also true that Sudan has been behaving better in some respects.
The death toll in Darfur is hugely reduced, and the government is negotiating with rebel groups there. The Sudanese
government gave me a visa and travel permits to Darfur, allowing me to travel legally and freely.
The real game isn't, in fact, Darfur or the elections but the maneuvering for a possible new civil war. The last north-south
civil war in Sudan ended with a fragile peace in 2005, after some two million deaths. The peace agreement provided for
a referendum, scheduled to take place in January, in which southern Sudanese will decide whether to secede. They are
expected to vote overwhelmingly to form a separate country.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768619 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768619 Date: 08/31/2015
Then the question becomes: will the north allow South Sudan to separate? The south holds the great majority of the
country's oil, and it's difficult to see President Bashir allowing oil fields to walk away.
"If the result of the referendum is independence, there is going to be war - complete war," predicts Mudawi Ibrahim
Adam, one of Sudan's most outspoken human rights advocates. He cautions that America's willingness to turn a blind
eye to election-rigging here increases the risk that Mr. Bashir will feel that he can get away with war.
"They're very naïve in Washington," Mr. Mudawi said. "They don't understand what is going on."
On the other hand, a senior Sudanese government official, Ghazi Salahuddin, told me unequivocally in Khartoum, the
nation's capital, that Sudan will honor the referendum results. And it's certainly plausible that north and south will
muddle through and avoid war, for both sides are exhausted by years of fighting.
Here in Juba, the South Sudan capital, I met Winnie Wol, 26, who fled the civil war in 1994 after a militia from the north
attacked her village to kill, loot, rape and burn. Her father and many relatives were killed, but she escaped and made her
way to Kenya - and eventually resettled as a refugee in California. She now lives in Olathe, Kan., and she had returned
for the first time to Sudan to visit a mother and sisters she had last seen when she was a little girl.
Ms. Wol, every bit the well-dressed American, let me tag along for her journey back to her village of Nyamlell, 400 miles
northwest of Juba.
The trip ended by a thatch-roof hut that belonged to her mother, who didn't know she was coming - so no one was
home. Ms. Wol was crushed.
Then there was a scream and a woman came running. It was Ms. Wol's mother, somehow recognizing her, and they flew
into each other's arms.
To me, it felt like a peace dividend.
Yet that peace is fragile, and Ms. Wol knows that the northern forces may come back to pillage again. "I don't want
war," she said, "but I don't think they will allow us to separate."
My own hunch is that the north hasn't entirely decided what to do, and that strong international pressure can reduce
the risk of another savage war. If President Obama is ever going to find his voice on Sudan, it had better be soon.

Ambassador for life
Career Foreign Service ambassadors almost never serve much longer than their traditional three-year terms
overseas. There have been a few exceptions, most famously former ambassador to Israel Sam Lewis, who was in
Tel Aviv for eight years until 1985. But the rule generally applies.
This summer, however, Ambassador to Kenya Michael E. Ranneberger, a veteran Africa hand, apparently will
begin his fifth year on the job in Nairobi, and there's no nominee in sight to replace him.
That sparked speculation that the administration might want to extend Ranneberger in order to hold the job open
for Sudan special envoy J. Scott Gration, should Gration work out the Sudan mess. Gration, Loop Fans recall,
grew up in Africa and became tight with President Obama when he escorted the then-senator as he toured his
ancestral homeland -- or birthplace, as some folks say.
Gration, a retired Air Force general, early on had been looked at for a top administration job and perhaps as a
replacement for Ranneberger. But we're told that's not happening anytime soon because the White House is not
about to pull him off the full-time Sudan portfolio, despite some criticism that he's too soft on the war criminals.
"The ball's not even rolling in that direction," one source said.

CD M:
At behest of PDT, I tried to call you just minutes ago to ask about your availability for phone call from him this afternoon.
-First choice: 5:00 p.m. (your time)
-Alternative: 7:00 p.m.
- If neither works for you, then propose time and we'll accomodate.
Two options to suggest:
1.With our individual cell phones, it is difficult to involve third person - to wit, me. Could you arrange for a confeiBi ce
type number and code to which PD and I could call separately?
1.4(B)
2.Or as alternative, do you have capacity to call us separately to turn it into a conference call?
1.4(D)
Either option would not only make for a smoother conversation, but would also allow me to not have to be in same
location as PDT
so best that call be today.
Regards.

Hi Cheryl — hope you're holding up ok with all of the Haiti work.
I'm having a little reception on 3/22 6pm over at the OAS to celebrate my swearing-in. I'd love it if you could
come by for a glass of champagne and a little jazz music!
I'd love to invite the Secretary. Is that even proper protocol? Although she probably couldn't attend, I'd like to
share it with her. Your thoughts?

Subject: Call with Secretary Clinton
Dear Cheryl,
Good morning on a consequential and indeed historic week in the life of our country given the passage of health care
reform. President Obama was courageous, persevering and skilled in his leadership and efforts. Having said that, in my
humble opinion, he would not have been successful had it not been for President Clinton's, Hillary's and our efforts in
1994. That's my story and I'm sticking to it, and I believe it's true.
I know this has been a particularly demanding week in the life of the Secretary and in your life as well. Having
Netanyahu, AIPAC and a major trip to Mexico to fight the narco-traffickers is a formidable task even for Hillary Clinton.
Cheryl, I would like to respectfully request a brief meeting or phone call with Secretary Clinton following up on the
conversation she initiated with me at the Vital Voices event regarding the IDB. It's my sense and belief that this matter
needs to be carefully handled for a number of reasons including the longstanding friendship that both the Secretary and
President Clinton have with Luis Alberto Moreno. I also have another important and timely matter (personal not
business) that I would like to discuss with Hillary in our time together.
As I think you know, I try to be very judicious about these types of requests. I think 15 minutes either in person or by
phone will be adequate to cover both of these subjects. As always, I appreciate your consideration relating to my
request. Thank you and I'll await your guidance and direction.

Andrew -
It's a good strong intro that not only mentions her great record in the Senate, but also highlights her record as
Secretary of State -fighting against efforts to delegitimize Israel, defending Israel against Goldstone, supporting the
increase in aid to Israel, and fighting to secure strong sanctions against Iran. Should set a strong, positive tone.
Have a safe trip,

Haiti recovery blueprint includes foreign donors
BY JACQUELINE CHARLES
jcharles@MiamiHerald.corn
Call it the $100 million club.
That's the amount each donor nation will have to ante up for a say in Haiti's early recovery under a plan
Haitian President Rene Preval plans to present at an international donors conference in New York at month's
end.
While Haitian and foreign disaster experts were tallying the cost to rebuild after the Jan. 12, 7.0-magnitude
earthquake -- $11.5 billion -- Preval and his advisors have been quietly negotiating the blueprint of the
development plan that will shape Haiti's reconstruction over the next decade.
"It moves it in the right direction," Mark Schneider, senior vice president of the Washington D.C.-based
International Crisis Group, said of the plan, which he has seen. "I've said, the first phase of reconstruction is
a decade. The real test is a generation and hopefully with partnerships both inside and outside of Haiti, it
will continue for that time period."
The plan includes creation of an Interim Haitian Recovery Commission that will -- for the first time -- seek
to guide how and where aid is spent by giving both Haitians and foreigners a vote in reconstruction priorities
and projects over the next 18 months. Haiti's president will retain veto power and there's a starring role for
former U.S. President Bill Clinton if he wants it.
The blueprint is certain to come under plenty of scrutiny in Haiti, a country plagued and in-fighting among
donors. Over the years, billions of dollars in aid -- often delivered after hurricanes or political coups -- has
failed to produce any signs of lasting progress in a country that remains the poorest in the Western
Hemisphere.

Clinton, who is to visit Haiti Monday along with former President George W. Bush, will be asked to help
lead Haiti's reconstruction planning over the short-term as co-chair -- along with the Haitian prime minister -
- of the commission, several sources confirmed to The Miami Herald.
Clinton, who is already in charge of the international relief effort for the United Nations, has not said
whether he'll accept the job as Haiti's reconstruction czar but he has championed the strategy, saying the goal
is to provide to Haitians the success that has long eluded them.He and Bush are visiting Haiti, where more
than 200,000 people were killed in the quake, in their roles as co-chairs of the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund. The
private U.S. fundraising effort, initiated by President Obama, has raised more than $36 million.
The commission's goal will be to plan and coordinate reconstruction priorities and projects over the next 18
months with recommendations from a 20-member board made up of Haitians and foreign donors.
Eventually, the commission would morph into the Haiti Development Authority (HDA), a central planning
agency tasked with approving all reconstruction projects in Haiti regardless of which country or aid agency
is funding it.
The authority's executive director, like that of the commission, likely would be a well-respected Haitian.
"Haitians must have the chance to lead the rebuilding of Haiti," said U.S. Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton's chief of staff Cheryl Mills, a key person in talks. "Development authorities have helped other
countries that have large donor communities to accomplish their visions -- we want no less for Haiti and its
citizens."
The original plan, first reported by The Herald last month, was modeled on the successful reconstruction
authority created in Indonesia after the 2004 tsunami and presented by Mills to Preval and top Haitian
officials last month. Other countries and multilateral institutions also presented plans to the Haitian
government.
The U.S. plan has since undergone several revisions at Preyal's urging.
Among them: offering a voting seat on the commission's board to each donor pledging $100 million or more
over the next two years and donors who provide $200 million in debt cancellation. As a result, Venezuela is
among the likely donors to help review and approve projects. Initially 16 members, the board was expanded
to give a say-so to Haiti's private sector and labor unions and the 15-nation sub-regional Caribbean
Community (CARCIOM). The plan also establishes a Multi-donor Trust Fund, administered by the World
Bank, to possibly pool donors' dollars for reconstruction projects.
For decades, Haiti has been plagued by a lack of planning and coordination among donor nations and aid
groups as they battled among each other in the poverty-stricken country.
Using the Indonesian model employed in Indonesia after the Asian tsunami, plan supporters say the
reconstruction commission offers Haiti the best chance to lead its own redevelopment and to change the way
donors do business, ending an era where aid groups spend budgets larger than Haitian ministries without any
accountability to the Haitian people. But that can only be achieved in Haiti, say supporters, if donors and
their projects are coordinated, and in line with Haiti's vision and post-disaster reconstruction needs, which
will be presented at the March 31 New York conference and remains a work in progress while the
government seeks input from various Haitian groups, including the Diaspora. Also Haiti's parliament must
vote on the creation of the Interim Haitian Recovery Commission.
Still, the idea of putting Haiti's reconstruction into the hands of one central authority -- or having some
donors channel their money into a trust fund -- is not without detractors. Some argue that the authority could
render government ministries obsolete because projects would now bypass them, while others point out that

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768926 Date: 08/31/2015
a similar World Bank fund in the Sudan has been troubled by rules leaving schools and healthcare facilities
undone as hundreds of millions of dollars remain unspent.
Meanwhile, Haitian government officials worry that donors may not want to change the way they do
business with Haiti, rendering the reconstruction a failure before it gets started.
"The creation of the [trust fund] or the [Haiti Development Authority] are improvements to changing the
paradigm if and only if everybody plays the game -- putting most of their money in the fund -- and access to
the funds is more flexible than the usual process of disbursing from the international donors," Haitian Prime
Minister Jean-Max Bellerive told The Herald.
In the past, donors have pledged hundreds of millions of dollars to assist Haiti but have fallen short in
disbursing those dollars -- or at times spent the money on projects without consulting the Haitian
government about whether the projects were needed.
Last week, as representatives of the Haitian government and others met to prepare for the New York
conference, Bellerive warned that "New York could be a failure if we don't reach an agreement on the
structure for the coordination and the organization of the trust fund. ..(and) don't manage to establish together
the priorities for immediate investments," to begin reconstructing the country.

Subject: Call with Secretary Clinton
Dear Cheryl,
Good morning on a consequential and indeed historic week in the life of our country given the passage of health care
reform. President Obama was courageous, persevering and skilled in his leadership and efforts. Having said that, in my
humble opinion, he would not have been successful had it not been for President Clinton's, Hillary's and our efforts in
1994. That's my story and I'm sticking to it, and I believe it's true.
I know this has been a particularly demanding week in the life of the Secretary and in your life as well. Having
Netanyahu, AIPAC and a major trip to Mexico to fight the narco-traffickers is a formidable task even for Hillary Clinton.
Cheryl, I would like to respectfully request a brief meeting or phone call with Secretary Clinton following up on the
conversation she initiated with me at the Vital Voices event regarding the IDB. It's my sense and belief that this matter
needs to be carefully handled for a number of reasons including the longstanding friendship that both the Secretary and
President Clinton have with Luis Alberto Moreno. I also have another important and timely matter (personal not
business) that I would like to discuss with Hillary in our time together.
As I think you know, I try to be very judicious about these types of requests. I think 15 minutes either in person or by
phone will be adequate to cover both of these subjects. As always, I appreciate your consideration relating to my
request. Thank you and I'll await your guidance and direction.
Personally,
Mack

COMMUNIQUE
During their telephone conversation last week, the President of the Republic and President Obama expressed the
resolute commitment of our two countries in Haiti, and decided to combine their efforts in order to deal with the urgent
humanitarian situation and to respond, in the future, to the enormous reconstruction requirements.
The French authorities have, since then, been entirely satisfied with the cooperation between our two countries and,
beyond that, the continuous coordination between the Crises Centers of the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs
and the U.S. Department of State. They want to pay tribute to the United States' extraordinary mobilization efforts in
support of Haiti and the vital role it is playing on the ground.

JERUSALEM - (AP) Israel's premier has ordered an investigation into how government officials announced plans for a
new Jewish housing project in east Jerusalem during a visit by Vice President Joe Biden. Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's office said he ordered the probe late Saturday after he met with top Cabinet ministers. While Biden was
visiting earlier this week, Israel's Interior Ministry said it approved plans to build 1,600 homes for Jews in disputed east
Jerusalem. Biden condemned the announcement, which overshadowed his visit. Netanyahu has apologized for the poor
timing of the announcement, but given no sign he will cancel the construction orders. The Palestinians claim east
Jerusalem as their capital, and Israel's annexation of the area is not internationally recognized.

Colleagues —
Passing on the latest information (received at 2150) from PO McGrath. The name of the deceased American Citizen
Services LES is Lesley Enriquez. Her husband, killed in the same attack, was U.S. citizen Arthur Haycock Redelfs. The
name of the surviving Fraud Prevention Unit LES is Hilda Antilion. The name of her deceased husband is Alberto Salcido
Cisneros.
THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS REPRODUCED FROM THE CONSUL GENERAL'S EMAIL: RSO Greg Houston is seeking
to make arrangements to return to post tomorrow. Post management will try to schedule a town hall meeting for all
staff, the meeting to be held at the Consulate at the earliest feasible time tomorrow or Monday (a Mexican holiday).
We just held a town hall meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the anticipated Mexican travel warning/authorized
departure/compensation issues. We also briefed the staff on a Wardens Message we were making yesterday about
trouble anticipated this weekend at what is believed to be a cartel-owned or —associated nightclub located very close to
the Consulate General. There is concern within the Consulate community that the attacks today were a cartel response
to the Wardens Message. At this time we have no indication that this linkage with the Wardens Message exists, and
there is information that in the case of Ms. Enriquez and her husband the attack was a case of mistaken identity on the
part of the cartel hit squad.
Our information on the Salcido/Antillon incident is still largely incomplete. Although the fact that both families had
attended the same social event earlier in the afternoon suggests some kind of linkage between the two attacks, so far
we have not been able to make a determination one way or the other as to whether such a linkage exists.

Colleagues,
Ciudad Juarez Principal Officer Ray McGrath called Ops at 2050 to report two killings involving LES employees.
Earlier on March 13, drug cartel hit teams fired upon two separate privately owned vehicles at two separate
locations. The incidents happened between 1400 and 1700 local. In one vehicle, the husband of a LES was killed. In
the second, the LES and her husband were killed. Both LES were at the same social event before the hit. The PO is
working to find out if anyone else is at risk.
PO McGrath said colleagues in El Paso state there are some indications that the attack was a case of mistaken
identity. A vehicle of similar make & model is being targeted by the cartels.
RSO Greg Houston is currently in Monterrey, but is working with his A/RSO to send a spot report. RSO Houston's is
reachable in Monterrey at
Both LES were State FSNs. Ops is attempting to obtain their names.

Madam Secretary -
One of our Mexican staff and the husbands of two Mexican employees were killed last night in Juarez.
In one case a Mexican employee and her husband were leaving a party hosted by another Mexican employee. They were
in separate vehicles. He was stopped by a hit squad and killed before her.
In a second case a Mexican employee and her husband were killed leaving the same party. Their 3 month-old baby was
left alive in the back seat.
We have activated all investigative and intelligence channels to learn all we can. The head of Mexico's intelligence
service called to express President Calderon's condolences and to offer any support we need. Patricia Espinosa is aware.
She may call you. We will let you know if there are any leads on why this tragedy occurred.

Robert,
Are you sure that the USA Pavilion would not be in a sponsorship by Wynn Resorts (specifically Wynn
Macau)? There CFO, Matt Maddox, has expressed strong interest.
The Wynn Macau well known brand in China and Steve Wynn is an extremely popular figure in China. In
addition, he is well respected and well though of by the Chinese leadership and business leaders. A sponsorship
by Wynn would be well received.
I should be able to get an answer by early next week, but don't want to look foolish if they would be rejected.

Subject: Border Issues Update
The latest regarding border issues:
a) Per EmbOff, border at Jimani remained disorganized but functional as in recent days.
b) The flow of persons across the border is constant, but no mass influx. However, official figures under-report
the numbers of people crossing, as the data reflect only those being processed correctly. Some Haitians are
sneaking across the border, per USG official. Haitian media also report "tens of thousands" leaving Port-au-
Prince, some for the DR border. However, police officials say they have not seen increased illegal entry
attempts in the mountains around the Jimani crossing.
c) A Haitian immigration official said that as of lpm on 1/19 he had issued approximately 600 laissez-passes to
travelers without documents. Dominican authorities at the other side of the border crossing are generally
turning away travelers without a valid visa or official travel document. Medical emergency cases continue
being allowed in.
d) The border crossing at Jimani was closed for 45 minutes after the Haitian colonel in charge of customs on
the Haitian side began demanding "manifests" from vehicles trying to bring assistance across. GODR
officials managed to talk the colonel into backing down, but plan to seek his removal. (Note: It is unclear
whether this was an attempt at rent-seeking by the Haitian official, but some reporting implied that. End
Note).
e) As the next Market Day in Jimani will be Thursday, efforts are already underway to see if market activities
that day can be organized so as not to block/hamper through-put of assistance / evacuation vehicles.

The regional psychiatrist is coming in tomorrow. I will meet with him as soon as he arrives and lay out the situation for
him and ask for his advice. It is clear that we need to start rotating personnel out soon even if it is just for a couple of
days. I will work on Consular and the Control Room team to start these rotations. We will need to see if our
medevacuees will become permanent before looking for replacements.

Gentlemen,
I believe we need a psychological specialist sent here as soon as possible. We're having to medivac two folks due to
nerves and high blood pressure and another one is simply not able to function (psychevac). I am
worried about the Consular staff as well: very tired, stressed and overworked. I hope you could get someone down here
tomorrow if possible.
We also need to get some people out of this building (my problem, I know). It's a real ant farm and a health disaster
waiting to happen.
Thanks.

Robert,
Are you sure that the USA Pavilion would not be in a sponsorship by Wynn Resorts (specifically Wynn Macau)? There
CFO, Matt Maddox, has expressed strong interest.
The Wynn Macau well known brand in China and Steve Wynn is an extremely popular figure in China. In addition, he is
well respected and well though of by the Chinese leadership and business leaders. A sponsorship by Wynn would be
well received.
I should be able to get an answer by early next week, but don't want to look foolish if they would be rejected.

Iceland legalizes same-sex marriage
The Icelandic parliament, Albingi, legalized same-sex marriage June 11. The vote was 49-0. Fourteen MPs
skipped the vote.
Same-sex couples will be able to marry starting June 27.
The registered-partnership apparatus that gay couples used in the past will no longer be available.
The national LGBT association, Samtokin 78, said Iceland had removed the last obstacle to equal rights for all.
Iceland is the ninth nation where same-sex couples can marry nationwide and the 11th nation where same-sex
marriage is possible.
Icelandic Prime Minister Johanna Siguroardottir is openly lesbian.
Gay marriage also is legal in Belgium, Canada, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain,
Sweden, Mexico City, Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont and Washington, D.C.

Bill Clinton and Jean Max Bellerive to head the reconstruction committee
An Interim Committee for the Reconstruction of Haiti will be implemented in the coming days. It will be headed by former
U.S. President Bill Clinton and the current Prime Minister of Haiti Jean Max Bellerive.
This committee could be composed of 16 members including 9 foreigners. It should have the flexibility to make important
decisions in the context of rebuilding the country devastated by a powerful earthquake last January 12.
During 18 months, this new entity will manage the funds available to carry out all operations related with the
reconstruction of Haiti.
Under a plan presented by the Haitian authorities at a technical meeting held last week in the Dominican Republic, 11.5
billion would be needed to rebuild Haiti.

Obama's diplomacy, not fully engaged
By Jackson Diehl
Monday,'May 3, 2010; A15
Barack Obama's foreign policy has been defined so far by his attempts to "engage" with adversaries or rivals of
the United States, such as Ayatollah Ali Khamenei of Iran and Dmitry Medvedev of Russia. The results have
been mixed. But now the president's focus is visibly shifting. In the next 18 months, Obama's record abroad will
be made or broken by his ability to do business with two nominal U.S. allies: Hamid Karzai and Binyamin
Netanyahu.
Karzai has become the hardest problem in Obama's Afghanistan surge, one that might be summed up as "can't
win with him, can't win without him." Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu holds the key to whether Israel will be
prepared to accept a Palestinian state within the two-year time frame Obama has established -- and also,
perhaps, whether Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons will lead to war.
Both men are prickly and somewhat inscrutable. Both know their countries and their own careers depend on
support from the United States, but both are also resistant to key elements of Obama's policies. Handling them
well requires skillful and subtle diplomacy by the U.S. president and by those who carry out his policies.
And Obama has not done well. In fact, his treatment of the Israeli and Afghan leaders during one week in late
March -- immediately after his victory on health care -- marked a low point of his performance as president.
First, Obama seized on an errant Israeli announcement about housing construction in East Jerusalem to reopen a
pointless battle with Netanyahu. During a disastrous March 23 meeting at the White House, Obama demanded -
- in vain -- that Israel stop all building in Jerusalem, and at one point he left Netanyahu and his delegation to
stew in the Roosevelt room while he retired to the second-floor residence for dinner.
Five days later, Obama flew to Kabul for another cold meeting, this time with Karzai. In a briefing for reporters
on the plane, national security adviser James Jones made it clear that Obama was displeased with Karzai's lack
of progress since beginning a new term as president last fall. In case there was any doubt, Obama spelled out
that dissatisfaction in a television interview a day after his return.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769159 Date: 08/31/2015
Was it hubris from health care that brought on this burst of presidential imperialism? Whatever the cause, the
results were disastrous. Netanyahu retreated to Jerusalem, where, after a couple of weeks of sulking, he
defiantly announced that settlement construction in Jerusalem would continue. Karzai summoned Iranian
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to Kabul, then delivered a tirade against Western interference that concluded
with a threat to join the Taliban.
The administration has spent the past month cleaning up this mess. Obama abruptly changed his approach,
sending a note to Karzai in early April thanking him for the Kabul visit and confirming his invitation to visit
Washington in May -- a trip that, just days earlier, the White House had hinted at canceling. Meanwhile, the
president and a good part of his Cabinet have been heaping love on Israel -- if not precisely Netanyahu -- by
proclaiming their commitment to the relationship in speech after speech before pro-Israel groups.
The result is that the administration now has a detailed plan for working with Karzai over the next several
months. Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which have been delayed for two months by the flap over Jerusalem,
might finally begin this week. Quiet diplomacy by the administration's special envoys in the Middle East and
Afghanistan, George Mitchell and Richard Holbrooke, has achieved what presidential lectures did not.
The underlying problems, however, haven't changed. Karzai still has little appetite for attacking the corruption
in his government or rallying support for U.S. military campaigns against the Taliban. Netanyahu remains
wedded to a right-wing coalition that would not allow him to make significant concessions in peace
negotiations, even if he wanted to.
Obama has to find a way to coax each of them toward a change of course. Public bullying won't do it.
Assurances of U.S. support and stroking by special envoys go only so far. What's missing is personal chemistry
and confidence, the construction of a bond between leaders that can persuade a U.S. ally to take a risk; in other
words, presidential "engagement." Isn't that what Obama promised?

Below is an interesting analysis done by Doug Mercado that relates to one of the questions you were asked about the
flash appeal. Good background (for when you have a minute), as well as a reminder that there is a great deal of liquidity
in the NGO community that needs creative guidance.

Subject: RE: Reuters / Haiti humanitarian need competes with recovery plan
Hi All,
Just to put this into perspective....yes, the UN Flash Appeal for Haiti is only funded at 48% ($718 million). Just for
comparison, here are figures for other UN humanitarian appeals: DRC is funded at 5%, Sudan at 23%, Afghanistan at
31%, Kenya at 18%, Chad at 4%. Clearly, not all disasters/responses are the same. Perhaps the scenario that most
closely approximates the needs generated by the Haiti earthquake is that of the Indian Ocean tsunami
(2004/2005). Oddly enough, the UN Flash Appeal for the Indian Ocean Tsunami ran to $1.4 billion (the exact same figure
as for the Haiti Flash Appeal). In the end, the UN humanitarian appeal for the Indian Ocean tsunami stood at $1.2 billion
(a coverage rate of 85%). In the worst of disasters, the funding for UN humanitarian appeals never reaches 100%.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769175 Date: 08/31/2015
We should not forget that there is an enormous amount of money being funneled through channels outside the UN
appeal system. For example, the Red Cross movement (including IFRC, ICRC and the national societies) has raised
between $700 and $800 million for Haiti. The American Red Cross alone raised $400 million (they project that it will
take them five years to spend this money on relief and recovery activities in Haiti). InterAction, the consortium of US-
based NGOs has announced that its members have raised nearly $700 million for relief and early recovery activities in
Haiti. I met with two NGOs today: OXFAM has raised over $100 million. World Vision has raised $250 million
specifically for its earthquake response in Haiti (on top of its regular budget of $50 million for Haiti). We haven't been
able to get reliable figures on what non-US NGOs have raised, but I would imagine it to be considerable (at least over
$500 million as a conservative estimate).
Clearly, there is an
enormous amount of money raised for Haiti relief and recovery efforts through the UN system and outside the UN
system. The challenge is to get an accurate tally of the funding available from UN agencies, lOs and NGOs (perhaps a
tasking for the OSE and/or OCHA) and maximize coordination among the various agencies holding this money to
improve allocation of resources. There very well may be underfunded sectors and overfunded sectors in terms of the
humanitarian response. Information sharing among donors and aid agencies sitting on funding is critical to avoid
spending too much money in some sectors/geographic areas and spending too little in others.

* Haiti humanitarian aid 52 percent short of $1.4 bin goal
* Time and money running out for humanitarian effort - UN
By Michelle Nichols
UNITED NATIONS, March 29 (Reuters) - As donors are being asked to dig deep for Haiti's reconstruction,
they also need to address the country's immediate humanitarian need as hurricane season looms and quake
survivors face increasing violence, U.N. officials said on Monday.
While a U.N. summit in New York on Wednesday will aim to raise an initial $3.8 billion for the impoverished
Caribbean nation's recovery, an appeal by the world body for $1.4 billion in humanitarian aid is 52 percent short
of its goal.
The initial appeal by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs for $575 million was met
within a month, but when the call for funding was later more than doubled, the donations slowed to a trickle.
"Perhaps the extension of the flash appeal has got a little bit crowded by the fact that this conference -- with a
big ask for recovery -- is coming, so maybe donors have held back a little," said U.N. Development Program
chief Helen Clark.
"Obviously this medium/long term reconstruction recovery is incredibly important but ... if we don't get the
humanitarian relief side right as well you don't have the foundation for the successful longer term recovery," she
told a news conference.
Possibly more than 300,000 were killed when a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince
on Jan. 12 in what some experts are calling the deadliest natural disaster of modern times. Haiti's economy and
infrastructure were decimated and more than 1 million survivors left homeless.
"We should not think that the humanitarian crisis is over. The rain and the hurricane season will start soon," said
Edmond Mulct, acting head of the U.N. mission in Haiti.
"This may cause hundreds of thousands of Haitians who now live in tents -- some made of sticks and cardboard
-- to once again lose everything," he said. "Lives are at stake; we need to urgently build more durable shelter."
He also said protection of the vulnerable, particularly the women and children in camps, needed to be
strengthened. "But time and money is running out," Mulet said.
Violence is also increasing, he said, with the National Hospital, morgue and aid group Doctors Without Borders
reporting an increase in gunshot wounds. Mulct said there had also been a rise in sexual violence.
Mulct gained notoriety for wielding an iron fist during a previous stint as head of the U.N. mission when he led
mostly Brazilian "blue helmet" troops in a successful crackdown on Haiti's heavily armed gangs.

of gang members who escaped from jail after the earthquake.

Preval rejects US advice on presidential election
By JONATHAN M. KATZ (AP) –2 hours ago
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Haiti's president on Wednesday rejected U.S. Senate recommendations on
holding an election for his successor, brushing off criticism that the current process will leave the shattered
country without a credible leader.
A report issued this month by Sen. Richard Lugar, the ranking Republican on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, "strongly encourages" Haiti to let its international partners help restructure the eight-member
Provisional Electoral Council, which has been accused of corruption.
The report also recommends ensuring the participation of the key opposition party of ousted former President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, which was blocked from participating in 2009 legislative contests because of a dispute
over rival candidate lists.
On Tuesday, President Rene Preval fulfilled one recommendation of the report by issuing a signed decree
setting election day for Nov. 28.
But speaking at a news conference in an open-air gazebo alongside the broken remains of the national palace a
day later, Preval told reporters he had no intention of complying with the rest, including changing the election
body, known as the CEP.
"I'm not doing the CEP with international partners. I'm doing the CEP with national partners," Preval said. "The
senator's proposition is inadmissible."
Seeking to show the council was not "hand-picked," as he said in English, Preval handed out copies of
nomination letters for the panel's members submitted by various national and religious organizations, including
the National Council of Political Parties, Roman Catholic Church and National Confederation of Haitian
Vodou.
He also defended the prohibition on the exiled Aristide's Fanmi Lava1as party in last year's elections, a ban that
came after rival factions of the party submitted competing lists of candidates.
"International donors need to look for an accord with the CEP and the political parties and the factions of Fanmi
Lava1as," Preval said. "We are giving (the parties) the support that they need, and the factions need to figure it
out (for themselves)."
Preval did not discuss the forced resignation of an electoral council member accused of stealing a staffer's pay
or opponents' allegations that the council gave special privileges to the president's newly formed Unity Party
ahead of planned Feb. 28 legislative elections, which were postponed because of the Jan. 12 earthquake that
devastated the capital.

He also declined to answer questions about another U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee report that
criticizes Haiti's earthquake recovery, saying he would address that issue at a news conference on reconstruction
next week.
Elections have never been easy in Haiti, a country whose founding president crowned himself emperor. It took
186 years to hold what the international community considered a democratic election in 1990, which was then
closely followed by a coup d'etat.
Preva1, in fact, is the only Haitian ever to be elected president, serve a full term and hand off power to an
elected successor. Unable to run for re-election in the November contest, he pledged to relinquish power again
as he did in the 1990s — after protesters alleged earlier this year that he was dragging his feet on holding
presidential the election.
Doing so will require significant help. The electoral council's headquarters were destroyed and its records lost in
the quake, while millions of voters were either killed, made homeless or displaced. Its new headquarters is a
former Gold's Gym seized by drug agents.
The election will also be a cost burden for this grindingly poor Caribbean nation: $29 million according to
electoral officials at the news conference with Preval, $38 million according to the U.S. Senate report.
The Organization of American States and United Nations have pledged support. U.N. Secretary-General Ban
Ki-moon issued a statement Wednesday praising the decree setting the election date and pledged the help of
U.N. peacekeepers and advisers in preparing and supporting the ballot. Ban urged member states to quickly
provide the money needed to run the vote.

Do they honestly think that publicizing a quote like this, on record or off, works to their advantage?
Israeli diplomatic [euphemism for Prime Minister's Office -- DR] sources said: "Clinton isn't relevant and is out of
the circle of influence. Mitchell has taken over the peace process to a great extent and Obama, in any event, is the
important person in this story because he is the one who decides."

Netanyahu is to leave next week for Washington, where he will meet with US President Barack Obama. Rather curiously,
he is not scheduled to meet with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the course of his visit to Washington.
Contrary to his previous visit in March, this time the US administration intends to create the impression,
outwardly at least, that the severe crisis in the relationship has passed and that the relations between the two countries
are as strong as ever. In order to bolster that impression, the two leaders will meet the media together and will be
photographed. As opposed to the previous time, Netanyahu will also be put up at Blair House, the official White House
guesthouse, and not at a hotel.
That said, officials in Washington are waiting apprehensively for the answers that Netanyahu will provide in the

direct negotiations. Obama, apparently, will demand that Netanyahu agree to extend the construction freeze in Judea

direct talks with Israel. For the time being, the forum of seven is divided over this issue.

Subject: (Reuters) Pakistan makes arrests connected to NYC bomb attempt
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan on May 4 made several arrests in connection with the failed Times Square car bomb
attack in New York, security sources said.
"We have picked up a few family members" related to Faisal Shahzad, the chief suspect in the attempted attack, a
security official in Karachi said. A friend of Shahzad was also arrested.
Shahzad, a 30-year-old Pakistani-American, was arrested late on May 3 at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New
York after being removed from a plane as it was about take off for Dubai, American officials said.
Another intelligence official in Pakistan said Shahzad received militant training in northwest Pakistan near the garrison
town of Kohat. The area around Kohat is a stronghold of Tariq Afridi, the main Pakistani Taliban commander in the
region.
Pakistan, which could come under renewed U.S. pressure to crack down harder on militants after the Times Square
incident, vowed to help the United States bring Shahzad to justice
Shahzad will appear in Manhattan federal court to face charges "for allegedly driving a car bomb into Times Square on
the evening of May 1", according to a statement by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, FBI agent George Venizelos and New
York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly.
"We will cooperate with the United States in identifying this individual and bringing him to justice," Interior Minister
Rehman Malik told Reuters.
U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson met Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and Malik and
talked about the issue, Pakistani government officials and the U.S. Embassy said.
"We have an ongoing cooperation with the United States on anti-terrorism efforts. If required by the United States, we
will extend full cooperation to them in this regard," Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdul Basit said.

Subject: CNN on Syria
Washington (CNN) -- Sometimes foreign policy isn't best digested 140 characters at a time.
That's what a pair of young State Department officials found in Syria, where they were leading a trade delegation of
Silicon Valley executives. Their bosses back in Washington were mortified when media blogs picked up the musings of
Alec Ross and Jared Cohen on Twitter about which Syrian cafes serve the greatest frappuccino (Kalamoon
University) and their challenge to the Syrian telecom minister for a cake-eating contest (called "Creative Diplomacy.")
Creative, indeed.
It was a mild, but unfortunate distraction from what was widely considered an otherwise productive mission. The
delegation of senior executives, from tech heavyweights like Microsoft, Cisco Systems and Dell, met with Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad and other officials, as well as businessmen, civil society groups and academics battling their
government's tight-fisted control on the Internet.
The visit illustrated both the opportunities and the landmines Hillary Clinton's State Department has to navigate as it
logs into the digital age.
In Foggy Bottom, one needs to be fired up about being wired up.
Blogging and tweeting are now part of every diplomat's job description. At any given moment you can find someone like
the top official on Latin America tweeting in Spanish about his latest trip to Peru, or Secretary Clinton herself posting
podcasts on the State Department website and soliciting questions from the public on the State Department's blog,
Dipnote.
Beneath the web atmospherics is what Ross, Clinton's "innovation"
guru, calls "21st century statecraft."
Ross, a 38-year-old former technology adviser to the Obama campaign, and his partner in crime, Jared Cohen, a 28-year-
old author on genocide, youth and jihad who joined the State Department during the Bush administration, are at the
forefront of a new push by Clinton to use technology and social media as a diplomatic tool. Since taking office, Clinton
has made the spread of information technology and Internet freedom a cornerstone of her foreign policy, hoping both
will serve as catalysts for spreading democracy.
It used to be one of the biggest carrots the State Department could dangle before a country was a visit by the secretary
of state. Now it is a delegation of Silicon Valley heavyweights led by Ross and Cohen, which might include executives
from Microsoft, Google or Facebook.

Since the Obama administration took office, they have led delegations with executives from tech giants such as Google,
Facebook and Twitter to Iraq, Russia and Mexico with some tangible results. In Iraq, Google created a project to make
digital copies of 14,000 antiquities in Iraq's National Museum. And in Mexico, the delegation helped develop a network
for Mexicans to report drug-related crimes by cell phone.
The visit to Syria came as the Obama administration takes baby steps toward engagement with that nation. The United
States had not had an ambassador in Damascus for five years and the administration's efforts to fill that post have been
stymied by Congress.
The U.S. delegation was requested by President Assad himself earlier this year in meetings with senior U.S. officials. The
United States hopes playing to Assad's desire to modernize his economy and stated willingness for better diplomatic and
trade ties with the Obama administration could drive a wedge between Syria and Iran, its closest ally.
Moreover, the United States hopes facilitating the flow of information into Syria will create a more open political climate
there. While in Syria, the delegation was surprised to find many young entrepreneurs with a widely different attitude
about the outside world and a desire to network into it, including one young woman who, during a session with the
deputy IT minister, looked him straight in the eye and asked for more access to the internet.
"Syria's population is going to double in the next 17 years," Cohen said. "And young people in Syria are going to become
increasingly digital and connected or increasingly isolated. It is in our interest to see they are digital and connected."
Strict U.S. sanctions against Syria for its support for terrorist groups in Lebanon, Iraq and the Palestinian territories ban
the sale of most technology to Syrian markets, but the White House does have waiver authority to sell certain products
to Syria, and the purpose of the trip, in part, was to help facilitate American technology companies to enter the Syrian
market.
The Obama administration has eased exports of certain telecommunication products in countries where they were once
banned, including Cuba, Iran, Sudan and China, out of fears repressive regimes would use them to oppress their people.
"We are not naive," Ross said. "... Syria says it needs this technology for it's economic development. We understand
that, but we were very careful about the companies we selected for this delegation.
We won't support technology being reverse-engineered."
The Syrian government has blamed the sanctions for its economic stagnation. But the executives, whose companies
have a combined market value of close to a half a trillion dollars, delivered a blunt message to the regime in Damascus --
one which can't be delivered credibly by the US government: Our companies won't do business in a country without
internet freedom or protections for intellectual property.
"They painted a picture of what Syria could have," Cohen said of the delegation. "What they could invest in if Syria took
certain steps."
During the visit both Cisco and Microsoft raised the possibility of training in Syria under the right conditions.
As a result of the visit, the Syrians pledged to pass an e-commerce law that would provide safeguards against
government censorship or infiltration of internet sites, something the Obama administration had pushed for. But U.S.
officials made clear further steps would be based on Syria's actions on loosening the information chokehold, rather than
its promises. Ahmed Salkini, a spokesman for the Syrian Embassy in Washington, said his government is dedicated to
"creating an environment conducive for the work of IT companies and hopes to pass the e-commerce law "in the very
near future"
Salkini said the Syrian government found the delegation was successful in scoping opportunities for future cooperation.
"We constantly encourage private sector interaction between the U.S.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769255 Date: 08/31/2015
and Syria," he said. But he added, "We think the only way for this type of cooperation to succeed is with a lack of
governmental interferences and lack of political agenda from both sides."
This month Ross and Cohen will lead a delegation to Colombia and later this year, it's on to India.
They are a couple of virtual and diplomatic soul mates, virtually attached at the hip and finishing each other's sentences.
Both have become Twitterati (celebrities on Twitter) in their own right, as they tweet their way around the world
spreading the gospel of 21st century statecraft. Ross has some 287,000 followers on Twitter, while Cohen -- who gained
notoriety last year when he asked Twitter to delay scheduled maintenance to allow the Iranian opposition to continue to
use it to organize after the disputed election -- has about 305,000.
They are the public face of an effort at the State Department to wire the unwired. Clinton recently told a group of
Russian civil society groups visiting Washington, "We have a great team of really dedicated young people -- primarily
young people -- who care deeply about connecting people up. And I'm very proud of the work they're doing."
If they have a corner on the 21st century statecraft market now, it won't be for long. Recently Ross trained 50 European
ambassadors on how to implement the concept in their own countries. His goal, he says, is to create a community in
which countries can share their technology innovations among each other. For example Kenya, a pioneer in mobile
banking, could help spread the concept to its neighbors and beyond.
After their Syrian adventures in Twitterville, Ross and Cohen were advised to continue to use the technology, but avoid
the minutiae.
Still, State Department officials believe the digital duo is good for business, drawing in a new generation of individuals
interested in U.S. foreign policy.
"What they do has tremendous value," said Assistant Secretary P.J.
Crowley, the State Department's spokesman. "Whatever they put in their tweets, they have 600,000 Twitters followers
that are now connected in some way to the State Department. And I will take that to the bank."

Subject: Griot education project in Haiti - anothter idea -- much quicker ramp-up
Cheryl:
After watching scenes on TV, talking w/ you and others, here is idea for nearly immediate way to get kids back 'in school'
or into school for the first time. It would be very cheap, could get started very soon—say mid-February, could be linked to
other distribution networks (food/medical supplies), and would be quite organic and grassroots. I'll call it the Griot
education project (in the west African tradition of a streetside storytellers).
Context/Understanding:
Looks like there are a few hundred thousand kids in Port-au-Prince who pretty soon will be (already are) sitting around
day-to-day w/ more or less nothing to do. Their schools got destroyed, their neighborhoods in rough shape. These are
young kids who would be best served if they could get out of the house for a few hours a day (possibly even freeing up
parents to do rebuilding or other work), and not spend their time getting caught up in crime, or desperately searching
through rubble for a mal to eat... and get back to school, and engage their naturally curious brains.
The goal of this program is to immediately give them a place to go, a chance to interface with an energetic educator, and
at least expose them to relevant, skill-enhancing academic work that engages them while we rebuild education
infrastructure. It also would likely get them 1 meal each day, and if needed a way to get referred for immediate medical
attention.
Griot Educators:
We recruit and equip a cadre of teachers who will go out into communities with a set of portable materials each moming-
educators who after a few days will find a place to teach, and will have attracted class of students. This is modeled off the
street artist/storyteller.
We flyer the neighborhoods, advertising teaching positions. We work w/ whoever we can find who can help us identify
people who were good teachers prior to the earthquake and/or people who have the abilty to attract kids (appropriately).
We select teachers. We agree to pay them a daily/weekly stipend. We want people who know their communities, who
don't need a lot of direction, who will take a cart full of educational materials, find a corner, or abandoned building and
start teaching to whoever shows up. People who will do anything to get some young kids to try to read or do some math
problems or sing songs and write poetry...
Education Supply Centers
We set up education supply centers and a distribution system. Each center is staffed by small team-1 lead person is an
education-leader, others are admin and support. Griots come the center in the morning, they get a day's worth of
educational materials (we select it, we photocopy it, we give them 50 pencils, etc.). We agree to send over 50 meals two
hours later. Each Griot wheels his portable classroom to his/her spot and sets up shop... Kids come, and he/she
teaches. It builds momentum and kids get off the streets, out of their homes and come to the morning 'school' site. Kids
who come get a meal. Maybe we end up w/ 3 tiers of Griots-1 who works w/ 4, 5, 6 year olds, 1 with 7, 8, 9 year olds, 1
with 10, 11, 12 year olds. Each one picks up a packet of material that is more or less appropriate for that age group. All
this is incredibly flexible and fluid. Maybe one morning session and then an after lunch session.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769288 Date: 08/31/2015
The education supply centers are warehouses we set up. They have copiers, lots of paper, basic school supplies, some
art supplies, etc. (Over time, maybe people donate a bunch of books or magazines, etc—they become ways for artists,
volunteers, entertainers to connect w/ kids, as well.) Each morning a group of Griots go to their supply centers and pick
up materials, and fill up their cart... and roll down the block, or blocks and set up their 'school' for the day. Maybe someone
wants to donate a bunch of art supplies, or harmonicas—who knows—whatever it takes to get kids to show up and do
some academic and enrichment activities. These education supply centers likely get linked to other distribution hubs. This
way they can get linked w/ food or other supplies.
Longer-term/setting the stage for longer-term ramp up
Over time, some of the Griots will end up running little schools that start to feel permanent. Kids will bring in chairs and
stools...maybe some of the teaching material ends up staying at the school sites, and the end up as likely places for folks
to build/rebuild schools. But in the near term, the 'school' is whatever spot the Griot goes to where he/she can attract a
cadre of kids—and the good news is that can be almost anywhere.
This program is cheap -- as costly as it is to pay stipends to the Griots, plus the cost of supplies, delivery, and some
human capital to man the supply centers, develop/acquire high interest, high educational value material. I think quite
cheap, and could easily be costed out once we knew about how much we need to pay a Griot for a day of teaching.
It also gets some folks working, immediately.
Some Griots would take stipend and not teach; some wouldn't do it well; some would pawn off the food/biscuits...But we
could weed much of that out and w/ this sort of approach, you don't let a few bad apples spoil the larger program (or fear
of them stop it from getting started). This program is about planting the seeds for the future schools to come, about
getting young kids off streets and stoops and into a fun/learning environment, about empowering talented teacher-artists
to go out into their communities armed w/ some basic materials, their good will, their creativity (and a paycheck)—together
the kids and the Griots will find local places to call and claim as their schools.
And while this is going on, we have time to build out infrastructure (human capital, facilities, instructional/curricular
materials) for more robust ramp-up over time.
Per usual, feel free to ignore or pass on.

That number—I think il has to be over $1 b. tho because people will compare it to Mitch--sounds right to me altho not only
will the destruction likely go higher than the final numbers of I believe $8.5 b. for Mitch/George but the cost of
reconstruction if the aim is modern buildings, modern systems, decentralized development is also likely to be higher.
A separate question, beyond the money are the people who can be committed, which goes to USAID ramping up its staff
and capabilities, the civilian response corps and I suspect your QDDR recommendations, on how to imagine a sector by
sector renewal with international partners on the ground able to work side-by-side with Haitians in every ministry (starting
with those that are priorities, which have to be justice [police, judiciary and prisons], education, agriculture, energy/public
works/environment, etc. in PAP but also in those department capitals where you want regional development to be
launched--Cap Haitian, Gonaives, Jacmel, Hinche, etc. If it were done as part of an international support team, under UN
coord (?), and sign-off upfront from the Haitian government, it might work.
Three last points: 1) the Crisis Corps of the Peace Corps--I know that every RPCV who served in Haiti will be desperate to
help. Many of them have professional capabilitiesiAsk Aaron to locate them.
2) As part of what announcement is made on Monday, this might be the time to add some number of US Haitian-American
Creole-speaking police to the UNPolice force, particularly those with community policing experience, say 100.
3) Finally, what about an emergency lifting of whatever restrictions (quotas, tariffs, etc.) that may still impinge on Haitian
agricultural products coming to US, an emergency provisions of phytosanitary expertise to enable their farmers to meet
our standards and remove any restrictions (which exist) on their subsidizing their rice farmers for their domestic
production.
I know that you all are working 24/7 on this so I apologize to some degree for accepting your offer to send advice. But that
probably won't stop me from sending!! Warm regards, Mark

Hi Cheryl,
Heard you yesterday on NPR. Right on the money in terms of emphasizing coop with GoH and coord with UN et. al. One
thing I am not sure that I mentioned. I looked back and relatively early--4 weeks after Mitch at end Oct 98--we made the
estimate that the US contribut would have to be about $1 b. (when early damage estimate was $6 b.) and that was the
general amount mentioned in the first formin meeting by Madeleine here in early Dec and then the supplemental went to
Congress with more of a breakdown from USAID in early Feb. As soon as you can get an early supplemental to the Hill
while the focus is on Haiti, and our forces are on the ground there, the better chances that it will receive early action. Best,
mark

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 22, 2010
GLICKMAN STEPPING DOWN FROM MPAA.
Will become President of Refugees International in April; Pisano named as Interim CEO
Washington, D.C. — Dan Glickman, Chairman and CEO of the Motion Picture Association of America, Inc. (MPAA) today
announced that he will be leaving the MPAA beginning April 1, to become President of Refugees International, the leading
advocacy organization on refugee crises worldwide. Bob Pisano, President and Chief Operating Officer at the MPAA since
2005, will become interim CEO, while the search continues for Glickman's replacement.
"In making this announcement, I want to thank Barry Meyer, Jim Gianopulos, Brad Grey, Bob Ig-er, Michael Lynton, Ron
Meyer, and the entire MPAA.Board of Directors, for their guidance and leadership. It has been an honor to have worked so
closely with them. I also want to thank Bob Pismo and all the MPAA staff for their dedication during a time of major
transition in our business," Glickman said. "As I look forward to returning to public service and joining Refugees
International, I am proud to look back at what the MPAA has accomplished since I took this job in 2004. We have fought
vigorously on behalf of the 2.4 million Americans and other workers throughout the world whose jobs are based on a vibrant
film and television business. This is a powerful medium that can help make a difference, and I will always value my time
here. For me, perhaps the best thing about the job was the movies. I love movies. And as far as I am concerned, we make
the best movies in the world."
Barry M. Meyer, Chairman and CEO, Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., praised Glickman's leadership. 'Dan has
demonstrated great leadership in his role as Chairman of the MPAA. He has guided the organization during a time of historic
changes and unprecedented challenges throughout the entertainment industry," said Mr. Meyer. `We thank Dan for his
tireless support of the issues facing our businesses, particularly in protecting intellectual property rights in the United States
and around the world. We wish him every success in his new position."
Mr. Meyer continued: "We would also like to express our gratitude to Bob for agreeing to be interim Chairman and have
every confidence in his abilities to continue the crucial work of the MPAA."

"Throughout his tenure at the MPAA, Dan served as an incredibly skillful and dedicated advocate for the issues that are most
important to the film and television industries — global market access, copyright protection and ensuring an overall healthy
future for our collective businesses," said Jim Gianopulos, Chairman and CEO of Fox Filmed Entertainment. "Furthermore,
we look forward to working with Bob and are grateful that he's agreed to serve as interim CEO over the near term."
"Our industry has been well served by Dan's efforts and advocacy worldwide and we appreciate the job he has done on our
behalf. He is a great humanitarian and will be very effective in his new role," said Bob Iger, president and CEO, The Walt
Disney Company.
Glickman, who has held the top position at the MPAA since 2004, had previously announced that he would not be seeking a
renewal of his contract beyond September 2010 and has been working with the MPAA board during its search process for a
new chief.
Glickman presided over the MPAA during a period of unprecedented transition in the film and television industry. The rise of
digital technology has presented both challenges in the form of massive copyright theft and innovative opportunities for
filmmakers to share their work around the world.
Through his leadership, Glickman helped raise awareness of the economic consequences of copyright theft. He also worked
with a broad labor and business coalition to secure passage of the Pro-IP Act, which increased resources and enforcement to
protect intellectual prooerty. And he has vigorously promoted a myriad of legitimate ways for consumers to view movies and
TV shows on the Internet.
Glickman also helped lead the effort to win passage of legislation banning camcording in movie theaters throughout the
United States and around the world. And he worked to modernize the movie rating system, increasing its transparency and
launching a free weekly Red Carpet Ratings email service that makes this resource more accessible to parents.
Bob Pisano has served as President and Chief Operating Officer of the Motion Picture Association of America, Inc. (MPAA)
since October 2005 and brings to the MPAA a wealth of diversified experience in business and legal practice. Pisano is
responsible for all day-zo-day worldwide operations of the motion picture and television industry trade association, and a
member of the Board of Directors.
Prior to joining the MPAA, he was National Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer of the Screen Actors
Guild. Before his tenure with the Screen Actors Guild, Pisano served for six years at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) where
he was first appointed :Executive Vice President and then Vice Chairman and a member of the studio's Board of
Directors. Prior to that, he served as Executive Vice President and General Counsel and Member of the Office of the
Chairman of Paramount Pictures.

SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED January 22, 2010
NOTE FOR THE SECRETARY
FROM: G/TIP — Luis CdeBaca
SUBJECT: Child Trafficking in Haiti
G/TIP is gravely concerned about the potential for human trafficking (TIP) in the wake of
the earthquake, both as a result of the displacement of the population and the influx of troops
and aid workers. Even before the earthquake, there were in Haiti up to 300,000 restaveks
(children given away or sold by their parents and enslaved as domestic servants), as well as
reports that members of MINUSTAH used trafficked women in prostitution. In the 2009 TIP
Report Haiti was classified as a Special Case country with governance so dysfunctional it could
not be ranked.
The initial disaster response is focusing on immediate needs of food, shelter, and medical
care, but has thus far not addressed TIP prevention and protection issues. While attention is
being paid to the problems of orphans and adoptees, TIP was not adequately addressed in the
UN's initial flash appeal, so it is unclear which agency in the international system has the lead
on the ground. UNICEF has the child protection lead, UNFPA leads prevention of sexual and
gender-based violence, and IOM is tasked with shelter and camp management. We will work to
remedy, in a subsequent appeal, the omission of TIP from the operational plan.
We are moving to redirect $1 million of program funds that G/TIP has on Hispaniola and to
reprogram an additional $550,000; we will work with PRM to identify other funding
possibilities. Working through existing grantees and other experienced NG0s, it is our
intention to help resuscitate police child protection brigades that already exist in Haiti, to
rebuild capacity of Haitian organizations that protect restaveks, to prevent traffickers in the
Dominican Republic from enslaving displaced Haitians on farms and in prostitution, and to
educate Haitian parents of the risks of giving their children away in this time of crisis. We will
consult with partner agencies to ensure that the U.S. presence does not contribute to

Subject: Another Rescue--22 year old man by Israeli SAR
From Ha'aretz (NYT also reporting this, but quote about American and French teams failing is of concern):
An Israel Defense Forces search and rescue team extricated a 22-year-old Haitian man on Friday from the
rubble of a three-story building which collapsed as a result of last week's devastating earthquake.
The man was being treated at an lDF field hospital and is currently in stable condition.
Local residents directed the IDF crew to the trapped victim, the lDF said.
"American and French doctors were unable to rescue the trapped man and called upon the Israeli Advertisement
delegation's search and rescue teams who rescued the man within half an hour, from a tunnel,
2.5-3-meters long and were able to release him whole and healthy," said Maj. Zohar Moshe, a member of the
rescue team.

Please see attached a few quick notes based largely on the Trust Fund's progress report and an independent evaluation

Lessons from the Aceh and Nias Multi-Donor Trust Fund
1. The Government of Indonesia (G01) responded to the Tsunami by issuing a series of government decrees,
and immediately organized both overview and relief efforts to ensure a rational and coordinated
response. The first task was to produce a Damage and Loss Assessment (DLA). The DLA was followed by
a more detailed Master Plan for Rehabilitation and Reconstruction (MPRR). The MPRR provided in-depth
sector plans, spatial planning, the governance and supervision arrangements of finances with
considerable attention to how to avoid or minimize corruption. The process behind the MPRR was
consultative, with a wide range of local stakeholders and public offices being heard. The MPRR was
presented on 26 March, only 3 months after the Tsunami.
2. The MPRR was to form the basis for a general three-stage strategy. The Relief phase was originally set to
six months, but was then reduced to three: January- March 2005. The Rehabilitation phase is to run for
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769379 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769379 Date: 08/31/2015
about 21 months, through December 2006, and the Reconstruction phase from July 2006 through
December 2009. The MPRR provides a well defined phasing of interventions.
3. The objectives for the Relief efforts were humanitarian relief: rescue; food and medicine; emergency
infrastructure and temporary shelter; and burying the dead. The Rehabilitation phase is to restore
services to minimum level: public services; economic facilities; banking and financial institutions; trauma
treatments; secure land rights; law and order; and temporary shelter. Finally, Reconstruction is to rebuild
the region: rebuilding the economy (production, trade and banking); the transportation,
telecommunications, and social and cultural systems; improving institutional capacity; and housing.
4. The Government set up a ministerial-level agency to manage the MPRR program from Aceh itself, the
Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Agency for Aceh and Nias. The BRR was formally established end April
2005 and became operational early May. The World Bank Board on 30 March 2005 formally established
the Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDF) with a Steering Committee comprised of BRR, GOI, donors and civil
society. Having a credible local coordinators was key to success.
5. The EC channels nearly 93% of its funds through the MDF, while only 2.5% of USD 400 million from the
US goes to the MDF. While payments into the fund were slow, disbursements out of it were to begin
with even slower. By October 2005, project agreements for about USD 200 million had been signed, but
only USD 3 million had actually been disbursed. Disbursements picked up the pace thereafter. The delay
was caused by two principal impediments: first, donors were quick to pledge funds, but getting all the
exact written agreements in place took time. This points to the need for donors to be flexible regarding
formal agreements, and accept simple, generic paragraphs that can contribute to speedy resolution of
slightly differing phrasings and concerns. Second, the processing time for project approval and
implementation was a concern. Since the MDF was to have funded projects on-budget, they had to be
implemented by government institutions. This crated bottlenecks.
6. Smaller donors joined because they wished to support the reconstruction efforts in Aceh but do not have
own capacity and often not strong views on how best to pursue this. They want the Bank to assume
fiduciary responsibilities for the funds in a high-risk environment, and also to take a lead in ensuring that
the funds go to prioritized activities. The MDF is thus seen a well-managed bank account with some paid-
for administrative services. However, the all-inclusive Steering Committee made membership large and
to some extent unwieldy, and forced it to discuss both policy and operational issues.
7. The Multi Donor Fund Secretariat has developed an Outreach Strategy that includes regular radio talk
shows, field visits to meet and discuss with beneficiaries and communication through advertisements as
well as a telephone hotline.
8. MDF received praise for engaging the Government of Indonesia (G01) in policy dialogue. The MDF is thus
an entry point for engaging on conditions for sustainability, relevance and impact.
9. Because the MDF does not accept strict ear marking of donor contributions — though it does allow for
preference indications — it means that the funds are freely available for programming according to the
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769379 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769379 Date: 08/31/2015
criteria and priorities that the MDF agrees to. Given strong GOI participation, the MDF is seen as the
most successful instrument for harmonization and coordination in an environment that has been
criticized for a lack of coordination. The MDF's Mid Term Review conducted in 2008-2009 found that the
MDF had made a positive contribution to harmonizing donor efforts and to increasing the effectiveness
and efficiency of the reconstruction effort.
10. The MDF did not sufficiently engage the private sector and did not have a coherent job creation strategy.
The MDF lacked executive rights, but GOI and BRR are credited with leveraging a decisive response.

FYI: From one of the folks we hired who had been working with Pierre Louis:
Lessons from the Aceh and Nias Multi-Donor Trust Fund
1. The Government of Indonesia (G01) responded to the Tsunami by issuing a series of government decrees,
and immediately organized both overview and relief efforts to ensure a rational and coordinated
response. The first task was to produce a Damage and Loss Assessment (DLA). The DLA was followed by
a more detailed Master Plan for Rehabilitation and Reconstruction (MPRR). The MPRR provided in-depth
sector plans, spatial planning, the governance and supervision arrangements of finances with
considerable attention to how to avoid or minimize corruption. The process behind the MPRR was
consultative, with a wide range of local stakeholders and public offices being heard. The MPRR was
presented on 26 March, only 3 months after the Tsunami.
2. The MPRR was to form the basis for a general three-stage strategy. The Relief phase was originally set to
six months, but was then reduced to three: January- March 2005. The Rehabilitation phase is to run for
about 21 months, through December 2006, and the Reconstruction phase from July 2006 through
December 2009. The MPRR provides a well defined phasing of interventions.
3. The objectives for the Relief efforts were humanitarian relief: rescue; food and medicine; emergency
infrastructure and temporary shelter; and burying the dead. The Rehabilitation phase is to restore
services to minimum level: public services; economic facilities; banking and financial institutions; trauma
treatments; secure land rights; law and order; and temporary shelter. Finally, Reconstruction is to rebuild
the region: rebuilding the economy (production, trade and banking); the transportation,
telecommunications, and social and cultural systems; improving institutional capacity; and housing.
4. The Government set up a ministerial-level agency to manage the MPRR program from Aceh itself, the
Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Agency for Aceh and Nias. The BRR was formally established end April
2005 and became operational early May. The World Bank Board on 30 March 2005 formally established
the Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDF) with a Steering Committee comprised of BRR, GOI, donors and civil
society. Having a credible local coordinators was key to success.
5. The EC channels nearly 93% of its funds through the MDF, while only 2.5% of USD 400 million from the
US goes to the MDF. While payments into the fund were slow, disbursements out of it were to begin
with even slower. By October 2005, project agreements for about USD 200 million had been signed, but
only USD 3 million had actually been disbursed. Disbursements picked up the pace thereafter. The delay
was caused by two principal impediments: first, donors were quick to pledge funds, but getting all the

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769391 Date: 08/31/2015
exact written agreements in place took time. This points to the need for donors to be flexible regarding
formal agreements, and accept simple, generic paragraphs that can contribute to speedy resolution of
slightly differing phrasings and concerns. Second, the processing time for project approval and
implementation was a concern. Since the MDF was to have funded projects on-budget, they had to be
implemented by government institutions. This crated bottlenecks.
6. Smaller donors joined because they wished to support the reconstruction efforts in Aceh but do not have
own capacity and often not strong views on how best to pursue this. They want the Bank to assume
fiduciary responsibilities for the funds in a high-risk environment, and also to take a lead in ensuring that
the funds go to prioritized activities. The MDF is thus seen a well-managed bank account with some paid-
for administrative services. However, the all-inclusive Steering Committee made membership large and
to some extent unwieldy, and forced it to discuss both policy and operational issues.
7. The Multi Donor Fund Secretariat has developed an Outreach Strategy that includes regular radio talk
shows, field visits to meet and discuss with beneficiaries and communication through advertisements as
well as a telephone hotline.
8. MDF received praise for engaging the Government of Indonesia (G01) in policy dialogue. The MDF is thus
an entry point for engaging on conditions for sustainability, relevance and impact.
9. Because the MDF does not accept strict ear marking of donor contributions — though it does allow for
preference indications — it means that the funds are freely available for programming according to the
criteria and priorities that the MDF agrees to. Given strong GOI participation, the MDF is seen as the
most successful instrument for harmonization and coordination in an environment that has been
criticized for a lack of coordination. The MDF's Mid Term Review conducted in 2008-2009 found that the
MDF had made a positive contribution to harmonizing donor efforts and to increasing the effectiveness
and efficiency of the reconstruction effort.
10. The MDF did not sufficiently engage the private sector and did not have a coherent job creation strategy.
The MDF lacked executive rights, but GOI and BRR are credited with leveraging a decisive response.

The family visit was Respectful and alowed the families to have some closure.
Very shortly after arriving at the site I believe the families understood the magnitude of the devastation at the Hote

They thanked the Ambassador and Rescue teams, Consulate, etc who were Searching for their loved ones.
Given the sad situation - the families were greatful to speak with people who were searching for their children.

I heard it went well. They got to the Montana when there was still about a half hour of light.
American SAR personnel discussed each specific site within the Montana with the

Recovery operations had already begun and seven bodies (if I
remember the number correctly) were extracted this afternoon, including a number of Amcits.

Subject: modalities for Haiti
Meghann,
A couple of ideas.
1.To avoid a coordination nightmare, try to get a structure in which there is a single authority with some temporary
power - e.g. a senior Haiti figure (ex-PM would be ideal) + Bill Clinton, as co-CEOs, supported by a council where you can
put the key parties on so they dont feel excluded (e.g. EU which will otherwise sulk). It could start from the April Plan and
the US Plan.
2. To scale up basic service provision without doing a total bypass of the state, I suggest the Public Service Agencies
model that I have been working up for the OECD. Essentially, centralized funding of decentralized provision. Fortuitously,
this has just been endorsed by the Davos Global Agenda Council for Fragile States and will be pitched as one of the key
ideas at Davos. I attach the brief Davos write-up of the idea, and a fuller paper that I did recently for the OECD. Please
circulate as you think fit.
If you need anything from me I will be happy to help. I will be in Davos late next week.

Leslie - First, thank god you were in NYC on Jan 12th. I hope your personal losses were minimal. Surely,
Haiti has lost much. We all have...
Thoughts for Montreal:
1.This offers an opportunity to 'rebalance' Haiti.
2.Pay attention to the exodus from PAP and catch up with it. (The migration to PAP over the past 30 years was
an unnatural development, spurred by rural neglect and urban concentration.)
3.A decentralized system of 'welcome centers' in town and villages can assist returnees re-integrate. Medical
and continuing education services should be a part of them. NEED TO ACT NOW.
4. More important, the centers must be equipped to provide work - make them the basis for organizing the civic
service corps. Higly decentralized: work for cash; public works/environmental restoration/food production;
restoration of human dignity; rural-urban partnerships through work;e in Haiti's real future. Also a chance to
begin repairing the social fabric. Will need a 'tough love' approach; disciplined management. Not the work for
NG0s.
5.No investment in rural areas and no response to this opportunity will = back to the future re. crowded
PAP. People will trickle back to the city to replicate past problems.
6. The damage was done before the earthquake by development/investment policies that ignored the rural areas;
saw Haitians simply as sources of cheap labor; denigrated human dignity; failed to strengthen local institutions.
7. This must stop; can't happen again.
8.This is the time to move forward with the Civic Service Corps - quickly.

General and specific concerns: Specifically heard from Haiti is that Preval has acceded too much authority to

Second, more general, is that the BAMBAM families (the term, I understand, created from the initials of the 6
leading elite families) are gearing up to inflate costs of doing things and to try to monopolize to the extent they
can. Will forward in a separate email one or two articles I've seen on this.

When we met with PM and P, they both indicated they wanted US to play a large coordination role on their behalf to
ensure their voice, plans and goals were accomplished. We are committed to doing that as they requested.
I do think fast will mean some will make money they shouldn't — but goal is to have balance so we move with enough

urgent need for tent cities clear PAP is clear, definitely not part of solution. Fearful of potential permanance
of them unless alternates for rural resettlement along lines of talking points exist.
Am hearing that lots of concern that Haiti's "operators" are licking their chops to make lots of money off

Leslie - First, thank god you were in NYC on Jan 12th. I hope your personal losses were
minimal. Surely, Haiti has lost much. We all have...
Thoughts for Montreal:
1.This offers an opportunity to 'rebalance' Haiti.
2.Pay attention to the exodus from PAP and catch up with it. (The migration to PAP over the past 30 years
was an unnatural development, spurred by rural neglect and urban concentration.)
3.A decentralized system of 'welcome centers' in town and villages can assist returnees re-
integrate. Medical and continuing education services should be a part of them. NEED TO ACT NOW.
4.More important, the centers must be equipped to provide work - make them the basis for organizing the

production; restoration of human dignity; rural-urban partnerships through work;e in Haiti's real
future. Also a chance to begin repairing the social fabric. Will need a 'tough love' approach; disciplined
management. Not the work for NG0s.
5.No investment in rural areas and no response to this opportunity will = back to the future re. crowded
PAP. People will trickle back to the city to replicate past problems.
6.The damage was done before the earthquake by development/investment policies that ignored the rural
areas; saw Haitians simply as sources of cheap labor; denigrated human dignity; failed to strengthen local
institutions.
7.This must stop; can't happen again.
8.This is the time to move forward with the Civic Service Corps - quickly.

Lessons from Aceh:
• MDFs encourage greater donor participation: Smaller donors joined the Aceh fund
because they wished to support reconstruction efforts but lacked independent capacity and
often did not have strong views on how to pursue reconstruction. They wanted the Bank to
assume fiduciary responsibilities for the funds in a high-risk environment, and also to take a
lead in ensuring that the funds go to prioritized activities.
• Develop an outreach strategy: The Aceh MDF Secretariat developed an Outreach Strategy
that includes regular radio talk shows, field visits to meet and discuss with beneficiaries, and
communication through advertisements as well as a telephone hotline.
• Engage the government in dialogue: The Aceh MDF received praise for engaging the GoI
in policy dialogue. The MDF was an entry point for engaging on conditions for
sustainability, relevance and impact.
• Appointment on Envoy: The appointment of a high-profile UN Special Envoy (former
President Clinton) increased the availability of funding and willingness of international
agencies to try new approaches. It also could provide one forum for coordination among
donors, if the Envoy's office is adequately supported.
• Disaster prevention: The tsunami underscored the critical role of disaster prevention in
"building back better." It is difficult to overemphasize the importance of embedding risk
reduction into recovery, especially in Haiti, where natural disasters have caused enormous
human suffering.

• Coordinate proliferating aid agencies: Large numbers of both public and private aid
agencies are likely be active in Haiti for some time. It is important to develop effective
coordinating mechanisms and work to ensure that agencies bring actual expertise to the
country, reduce turnover of international staff, and seek staff with appropriate language
skills.
• Authoritative Assessment: Authoritative joint assessments involving the UN, the Red
Cross, and national governments could have a beneficial impact on the decision making
process and ensure broad buy-in.

Beyond the Earthquake:
A Wake-Up Call for Haiti
Alex Dupuy
Department of Sociology
Wesleyan University
Middletown, CT 06457
Long before the powerful 7.0 magnitude earthquake (and several aftershocks) struck Haiti on January 12 and leveled the
metropolitan capital city of Port-au-Prince and surrounding areas, that city was already a disaster waiting to happen.
With a population of more than 2 million in a city whose infrastructure could at best sustain a population of 100,000, the
local and national public administrations simply abandoned the city to itself. Neither provided meaningful services of
any kind-schools, healthcare, electricity, potable water, sanitation, zoning and construction regulations-and what they
did provide was poorly administered, or primarily served the needs of the wealthier or better off sectors of the
population who could afford to pay for them. Consider, for example, that only about 28 percent of Haitians have access
to health care, 50 percent have access to potable water, and 10 percent have electrical services. In short, the Haitian
state-i.e., the government-long ago abdicated its responsibilities to the majority of Haitian citizens, and at least since the
Duvalier era, deferred to bilateral and multilateral aid donors, non-governmental agencies (NG0s) to provide services to
the population. More NGOs per capita operate in Haiti than in any other country in the world, and they provide 70
percent of healthcare in rural areas and 80 percent of public services. This, in turn, has led to an extreme laissez alter
and the near total privatization of all basic services. Except for a brief seven month attempt in 1991 that ended in a
bloody coup d'etat against the democratically elected government of Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the turn to democratic
governance has not changed that basic reality. It is therefore no accident that while the earthquake caused death and
destruction among all social classes, the high death toll-estimates run from as low as 10,000 to a high of 200,000 so far,
which means no one really knows-is also a direct consequence of the poor infrastructure, inferior housing construction,
and the long-standing disregard for the basic needs and rights of the population.
What's more, geologists had warned the government of the probability of a seismic eruption for years, but as with
previous massive destructions and loss of lives caused by hurricanes and tropical storms, the government took no

measures to prepare for that possibility. It comes as no surprise, then, that the Haitian people have to rely entirely on
the international community to come to its rescue. This would have been the case even if the symbols of government
authority-the National Palace, the Parliament, the headquarters of the National Police, and other ministries-had not
been destroyed for the simple reason that the capacity of the Haitian state to respond to a crisis of this magnitude-or
even to less severe ones-is non existent due primarily to shortsighted practices and policies-political, economic, and
social-that prioritized the interests of the few-the 4 percent of the population who hold 66 percent of total assets and
the 1 percent who appropriate 55 percent of the national income-at the expense of the 75 percent of the population
who live on less than $2/day and the more than half who live on less than $1/clay.
There is no doubt that the dominant economic and political classes of Haiti bear great responsibility for the abysmal
conditions in the country that exacerbated the impact of the earthquake (or of hurricanes or tropical storms). However,
these local actors did not create these conditions alone but did so in close partnership with foreign governments and
economic actors with long-standing interests in Haiti, principally those of the advanced countries-the United States,
Canada, and France-and their international financial institutions (IF1s)-the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund,
the Inter-American Development Bank. Since the 1970s and under various free market mantras, these international
actors and institutions sought to and succeeded in transforming Haiti into a supplier of the cheapest labor in this
hemisphere for foreign and domestic investors in the export assembly industry; in dismantling all obstacles to free trade;
in privatizing public enterprises; and in weakening further the institutions of the state through policies that reinforced
Haiti's dependence on foreign aid organizations-governmental and non-governmental.
These policies had drastic consequences for the Haitian economy. Locating the assembly industries primarily in Port-au-
Prince encouraged migration from the rural areas to the capital city, contributed to its bloated population and sprawling
squalor, and provided a never ending supply of cheap labor for those industries. At the same time, removing tariffs on
food imports were detrimental to Haitian agriculture. Whereas in the 1970s Haiti produced most of the rice it
consumed and imported only 10 percent of its food needs, by the end of the 1990s it was importing more than 42
percent of its food needs, had become the highest per capita consumer of subsidized US imported rice in the Western
Hemisphere, and the largest importer of foodstuffs from the US in the Caribbean. Thus, US farmers benefitted at the
expense of Haitian producers. These policies, too, propelled rural-to-urban migration, with Port-au-Prince as the primary
destination, as well as emigration to the neighboring Dominican Republic, the Caribbean, and North America. Haiti is
becoming increasingly dependent on remittances from its immigrants, which now represent 35 percent of Haiti's GDP.
What, then, is to be done? The response of the international community-from governments, the UN, and NGOs around
the world-for medical treatment, food, water, temporary shelter, and road and communication repairs-has been
immediate and massive, but will need to be sustained for a longer time span if it is to help Haiti recover economically in
the short and medium term. Pressure is also mounting on bilateral and multilateral aid donors to cancel Haiti's debt of
some $1.15 billion.
But to be effective and long lasting, future aid must be unconditional and be given more in the form of grants than
loans. To that end, the Haitian people need to rethink how the country relates to the international community, in
particular the major powers and the IFIs. Basically, I would argue, Haiti needs to break with the policies advocated by
the major powers and IFIs that have proved disastrous for the Haitian economy. These policies are predicated on the
belief that Haiti can develop only if it remains open to the world market, relies on its comparative advantage of low-cost
labor to attract foreign investments in the export assembly industry, and prioritizes the production of selected
agricultural goods, such as mangoes, for export. Despite the failure of these policies to generate sustainable
development, reduce unemployment and improve the standard of living of the majority of Haitians, the major powers
and IFIs continue to advocate them as the solution to Haiti's chronic underdevelopment and poverty. This is shown, for
example, by the report written by former World Bank economist Paul Collier for UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in
2008, and the latter's appointment of former US President Bill Clinton to spearhead that strategy in Haiti. Ignoring the
evidence of the last 38 years, Collier's report calls for establishing a cluster of free trade zones for garment production
beyond the two that currently exist in Port-au-Prince and Ouanaminthe, and creating such zones for the production and
export of mangoes.

It is time for the Haitian people to mobilize as they did in 1990 to change the status quo, but this time by learning from
the mistakes of the past and avoiding placing their faith in false prophets. As it did in 1990, an agenda for change would
need to include the following:
1. Reject all the different versions of the structural adjustment policies of the IFIs that require that Haiti remove tariffs
on food and other imports, privatize public enterprises, exempt foreign investors from taxes on their profits in the
assembly industries, and curb social spending. Haiti could instead negotiate bilateral or multilateral agreements with
those countries that are willing to provide aid without tying them to the implementation of specific economic or social
policies.
2. Launch an immediate large-scale and national public works project to rebuild or expand Haiti's infrastructure,
communication, transportation, public schools, public health facilities, and public housing. Here, too, Haiti could rely on
bilateral or multilateral agreements to sustain this effort beyond the immediate post-crisis reconstruction now
underway with foreign assistance that will focus primarily on the quake-ravaged areas.
3. Prioritize Haiti's food security and sovereignty by launching an agrarian reform, and subsidizing production for the
local market as well as for export.
4. Promote the development of local and national agro-industries that use domestic inputs to produce consumer and
durable goods; and support the national handicraft industry and promote its expansion on the international market.
5. Protect workers' rights, such as the right to form trade unions and the right to strike, and provide a living wage to all
workers, especially in the export assembly industries.
It is obvious that these goals cannot be implemented all at once or immediately. But they must serve as the basis for a
large scale popular mobilization to hold the elected representatives of the people to account and to renegotiate Haiti's
relations with the international community.

Enforced transparency will countermand it.
I thought Collier's earlier idea of an Independent Service Authority was interesting as long as it was transitional
(toward a strengthened GOH) and had GOH authority from the get go.
I like your idea. At this point a reconstruction authority with Bellefive at its head makes sense. I like your idea
of a donor's coordination mechanism that I saw in your policy review powerpoint, with coordination on 'our'
side under the UN Special Envoy mechanism.
Maybe within the authority, there can be a private sector sub-group coordinated and monitored by the larger
authority? This sub-group might also include non-Haitians, including Dominicans.
Haiti's private sector will be less interested in decentralized investment, I think, especially if it focuses on
intensive labor and providing dignity and liveable wages to Haiti's people. This is a public works/public sector
initiative, in conjunction with international public sector organizations.
Sachs idea of the decentralized growth poles is also interesting - perhaps a way to mobilize decentralized
investment.

I'm going to look to see what businesses these folks are in but this speaks more than ever to the need for a Haitian
reconstruction authority with Bellerive at the head with outside key donor or two like in the tsunami that has the
plenary authority to make decisions ideally free from this type of influence. What are thoughts you have heard in that
regard?

General and specific concerns: Specifically heard from Haiti is that Preval has acceded too much authority to
the Vorbe family.
Second, more general, is that the BAMBAM families (the term, I understand, created from the initials of the 6
leading elite families) are gearing up to inflate costs of doing things and to try to monopolize to the extent
they can. Will forward in a separate email one or two articles I've seen on this.
I'm off to Trinity to prepare my classes for this week. (A reality of my full-time teaching load). While check
email later. Thanks for this opportunity to share thoughts. Am very anxious to do this.
Can't miss the NFC game, even though the Eagles (I'm from Philly) already collapsed. I also lived in S.W.

When we met with PM and P, they both indicated they wanted US to play a large coordination role on their behalf

I do think fast will mean some will make money they shouldn't — but goal is to have balance so we move with

Who are the Haiti "operator" types of which this concern is being spoken?

minimal. Surely, Haiti has lost much. We all have...
Thoughts for Montreal:
1.This offers an opportunity to 'rebalance' Haiti.
2.Pay attention to the exodus from PAP and catch up with it. (The migration to PAP over the past 30
years was an unnatural development, spurred by rural neglect and urban concentration.)
3.A decentralized system of 'welcome centers' in town and villages can assist returnees re-
integrate. Medical and continuing education services should be a part of them. NEED TO ACT NOW.
4.More important, the centers must be equipped to provide work - make them the basis for organizing

the civic service corps. Higly decentralized: work for cash; public works/environmental restoration/food
production; restoration of human dignity; rural-urban partnerships through work;e in Haiti's real
future. Also a chance to begin repairing the social fabric. Will need a 'tough love' approach; disciplined
management. Not the work for NG0s.
5.No investment in rural areas and no response to this opportunity will = back to the future re. crowded
PAP. People will trickle back to the city to replicate past problems.
6.The damage was done before the earthquake by development/investment policies that ignored the rural
areas; saw Haitians simply as sources of cheap labor; denigrated human dignity; failed to strengthen local
institutions.
7.This must stop; can't happen again.
8.This is the time to move forward with the Civic Service Corps - quickly.

Thanks Cheryl
I am now at my desk. I agree with concerns below. The cementing of the monopoly by Preval for the public container
port is a prime example how elite capture runs directly counter to job creation and social welfare.
Assets (land, heavy equipment, cement, petroleum) that are in high demand during a construction boom are in the
hands of a few. The risk is that price spikes will severely drive out the potential gains from aid dollars. Dual signatures
and injecting foreign experts into a HRA task force to review projects for eligibility will counteract obvious forms of
corruption.
The much harder task is to determine realistic benchmarks for project costs, given transfer pricing and de facto
cartels. Injecting competition and open bidding is needed to counteract this. The problem is that any Haitian firm will
loose business to US or Chinese contractors with much more favorable pricing structures (but limited spillovers to local
economy). A middle ground may be to invite joint ventures between Haitian and international companies to build up the
local workforce and overall skill base.

Enforced transparency will countermand it.
I thought Collier's earlier idea of an Independent Service Authority was interesting as long as it was
transitional (toward a strengthened GOH) and had GOH authority from the get go.
I like your idea. At this point a reconstruction authority with Bellerive at its head makes sense. I like
your idea of a donor's coordination mechanism that I saw in your policy review powerpoint, with
coordination on 'our' side under the UN Special Envoy mechanism.
Maybe within the authority, there can be a private sector sub-group coordinated and monitored by the
larger authority? This sub-group might also include non-Haitians, including Dominicans.
Haiti's private sector will be less interested in decentralized investment, I think, especially if it focuses on

Sachs idea of the decentralized growth poles is also interesting - perhaps a way to mobilize decentralized

Subject: (Washington Post) Obama's worst foreign-policy mistake
By Mitt Romney
Tuesday, July 6, 2010
http://www.washingtonpost.comiwp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/05/AR2010070502657.html
Given President Obama's glaring domestic policy missteps, it is understandable that the public has largely been blinded
to his foreign policy failings. In fact, these may have been even more damaging to America's future. He fought to
reinstate Honduras's pro-Chavez president while stalling Colombia's favored-trade status. He castigated Israel at the
United Nations but was silent about Hamas having launched 7,000 rockets from the Gaza Strip. His policy of
"engagement" with rogue nations has been met with North Korean nuclear tests, missile launches and the sinking of a
South Korean naval vessel, while Iran has accelerated its nuclear program, funded terrorists and armed Hezbollah with
long-range missiles. He acceded to Russia's No. 1 foreign policy objective, the abandonment of our Europe-based missile
defense program, and obtained nothing whatsoever in return.
Despite all of this, the president's New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New-START) with Russia could be his worst
foreign policy mistake yet. The treaty as submitted to the Senate should not be ratified.
New-START impedes missile defense, our protection from nuclear-proliferating rogue states such as Iran and North
Korea. Its preamble links strategic defense with strategic arsenal. It explicitly forbids the United States from converting
intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) silos into missile defense sites. And Russia has expressly reserved the right to
walk away from the treaty if it believes that the United States has significantly increased its missile defense capability.
Hence, to preserve the treaty's restrictions on Russia, America must effectively get Russia's permission for any missile
defense expansion. Moscow's vehemence over our modest plans in Eastern Europe demonstrate that such permission
would be extremely unlikely.
The treaty empowers a Bilateral Consultative Commission with broad latitude to amend the treaty with specific
reference to missile defense. New START does something the American public would never countenance and the Senate
should never permit: It jeopardizes our missile defense system.
The treaty also gives far more to the Russians than to the United States. As drafted, it lets Russia escape the limit on its
number of strategic nuclear warheads. Loopholes and lapses -- presumably carefully crafted by Moscow — provide a
path to entirely avoid the advertised warhead-reduction targets. For example, rail-based ICBMs and launchers are not
mentioned. Similarly, multiple nuclear warheads that are mounted on bombers are effectively not counted. Unlike past
treaty restrictions, ICBMs are not prohibited from bombers. This means that Russia is free to mount a nearly unlimited
number of ICBMs on bombers -- including MIRVs (multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles) or multiple
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769454 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769454 Date: 08/31/2015
warheads -- without tripping the treaty's limits. These omissions would be consistent with Russia's plans for a new heavy
bomber and reports of growing interest in rail-mobile ICBMs.
Under New START, the United States must drastically reduce our number of launchers but Russia will not -- it already has
fewer launchers than the treaty limits. Put another way: We give, Russia gets. And more troubling, the treaty fails to
apply the MIRV limits that were part of the prior START treaty. Again, it may not be coincidental that Russia is
developing a new heavy-load -- meaning MIRV-capable -- ICBM.
New-START gives Russia a massive nuclear weapon advantage over the United States. The treaty ignores tactical nuclear
weapons, where Russia outnumbers us by as much as 10 to 1. Obama heralds a reduction in strategic weapons from
approximately 2,200 to 1,550 but fails to mention that Russia will retain more than 10,000 nuclear warheads that are
categorized as tactical because they are mounted on missiles that cannot reach the United States. But surely they can
reach our allies, nations that depend on us for a nuclear umbrella. And who can know how those tactical nuclear
warheads might be reconfigured? Astonishingly, while excusing tactical nukes from the treaty, the Obama
administration bows to Russia's insistence that conventional weapons mounted on ICBMs are counted under the treaty's
warhead and launcher limits.
By all indications, the Obama administration has been badly out-negotiated. Perhaps the president's eagerness for
global disarmament led his team to accede to Russia's demands, or perhaps it led to a document that was less than
carefully drafted.
Whatever the reason for the treaty's failings, it must not be ratified: The security of the United States is at stake. The
only responsible course is for the Senate to demand and scrutinize the full diplomatic record underlying the treaty. Then
it must insist that any linkage between the treaty and our missile defense system be eliminated. In a world where
nuclear weapons are proliferating, America's missile defense shield must not be compromised. As currently drafted,
New START is a non-starter.

Ugandan LGBT Advocate Found Beheaded
Jim Burroway
July 5th, 2010
A reader tipped me to this horrible news. The severed head of a volunteer for Integrity Uganda, the pro-LGBT
organization founded by Bishop Christopher Senyonjo, was found in a pit latrine on a farm in Makindye
Sabagabo, Wakiso District.
Judith Nabakooba, a police spokesperson, identified the head as that of Pasikali Kashusbe, one of
the workers on Kigggundu's farm and a member of Integrity Uganda. Pasikali and his partner
Abbey are youth workers with Integrity Uganda charged with the responsibility of mobilising
young LGBT people in activities which build community capacity to face up to the challenge of
homophobia, especially in the area of attitude change and care through drama and sports
activities.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769462 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769462 Date: 08/31/2015
According to the police, a mutilated torso which was earlier in the week discovered in Kabuuma
Zone, about half a kilometre away from Kiggundu's farm was probably Pasikali's The torso was
described as belonging to a young man and had no genitals.
Pasikali went missing over three and half weeks ago when the country was celebrating Uganda
Martyrs Day. All efforts by his partner Abbey and other family members to find him had been
fruitless.
Bishop Christopher Senyonjo, Chairperson of Integrity Uganda lamented the murder of this
young man as 'absurd' adding that, 'clearly, the values of tolerance and social inclusion are sadly
being sacrificed on the altar of state ignorance, ineptness and good old colonial stupidity'.
Uganda's Martyr's Day, a national holiday, is a particularly dangerous time for LGBT people. The holiday
commemorates the death of several Anglican and Catholic missionaries ordered by the Bugandan King Mwanga
II, who felt that foreign religious influences posed a threat to his kingdom. In fact, his fears proved correct; the
executions prompted Britain to invade Uganda and turn it into a British colony. Popular lore has it that King
Mwanga II, who himself was a teenager, killed the martyrs because they refused his homosexual advances. It is
unclear how much of that part of the story is true or how much of it is lore that was reinforced by the British
colonial government to discredit the king.
The farm where Kashusbe's head was found is reportedly owned by Badru Kiggundu, who is the chairman of
Uganda's Electoral Commission. Police found the head while searching for a missing priest, Rev Henry Kayizzi
Nsubuga, who disappeared almost two and half weeks ago after delivering a speech at St. Paul's Church in
Kanyanya supporting homosexuality in Uganda.
The independent television network NTV Uganda posted this video three days ago, but doesn't mention the
circumstances which appear to have led to Pasikali's murder:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBj1bN3gtnQ
Daily Monitor, Uganda's largest newspapers, has a few more sparse details here. In this report, the victim is
identified as Paschal Kashushu. Amid conflicting reports, it appears that at at least one man has been arrested,
possibly a relative. I'm trying to get more information directly from Uganda.
Changing Attitudes has this statement from Rev Erich Kasirye, General Secretary, Integrity Uganda:
Pasikali and his partner Abbey joined Integrity Uganda in June 2007 and during the last three
years, Integrity Uganda has seen an increase in coordination and harmonisation of youth
activities. Pasikali emphasized the promotion of the concept of care across the continuum
through the formation of voluntary home care groups for young LGBTIs who continue to live in
fear. He will be greatly missed by the entire LGBTI fraternity.
As for the missing priest, the only direct news reports that I can find about him appear in the government-owned
New Vision. There is no mention of Rev. Nsubuga's sermon. Instead, it appears that relatives are painting the
missing priest as mentally "stressed." A report by a reporter from Kamulali Newspaper and re-published on the
virulently anti-gay web site Virtue Online provides more hints about the possible link between Rev. Nsubuga's
disappearance and his pro-gay sermon.

Subject: Doctors report from Haiti
Cheryl
This came to me through a doctor friend of Harold's and mine. It is a pretty grim snapshot from a group of doctors ( I
think from Mt Sinai hospital in NY) who returned from Haiti late last week .Our friend, Michael Hausman, is a terrific
hand surgeon who was trying to get down there to help. I was reluctant to send this to you because I know how hard
you and many other people have been working to relieve suffering and that you and others are working round the
clock. Nonetheless I thought you might be interested in their impressions so I am sending it to you as a data point.
Please feel free to share this with others.
Best
Mike

Thanks much appreciated.
I believe we went in with a reasonably comprehensive service we wanted to
provide acute trauma care in an orthopedic disaster. Our plan was to be at a
hospital where we could utilize our abilities as trauma surgeons treat the acute
injuries involved in an orthopaedic disaster. We expected many amputations
however came with a philosophy that would reasonably start limb salvage in what
we thought was a salvageable limb.
David Helfet put a team together which included:
2 orthopaedic trauma surgeons
3 orthopaedic trauma fellows
2 highly skilled anesthiologists
1 general surgery trauma surgeon
2 synthes reps who were also scrub techs
1 trauma nurse practioner to do triage
2 OR nurses
Our equipment including a huge amount of anesth medications and equipment,
ability to construct 150 ex fix both small and large, OR equipment including
scalpels etc, OR soft goods, splint material, OR prep material.
We also had a plan of physician and equipment replacemnt that was dynamic
where w/i 24hrs we could bring in what was necessary on the Synthes private jet.
We thought the plan was a good one.
We were incredibly naïve.
Disaster management on the ground was nonexistent. The difficulties in getting
in despite the intelligence we had from people on the ground and david helfet's
high political connections with Partner's in Health as well as the Clintons only
portended the difficulties we would have once we arrived.
We started out friday morning, got a slot to get in friday that was eventually
cancelled when we were on the runway to be rescheduled the next day. We
diverted to the DR and planned on arriving in P OP saturday.
Once on the ground the hospital we had intelligence that was up and running with
2 OR's General Hospital was included severely in the earthquake and not capable
of running functioning OR's as there was no running water and only a limited
electrical supply on generator.
We quickly took our second option
Community Hospital of Haiti. We found approx 750 pt in the hospital upon our
initial eval, the hospital had running water, electricity and 2 functional OR's
Our naivette did not expect that the 2 anesth machines would not work, there
would be 1 cautery for the hospital, autoclave that fit instruments the size of a
cigar box, no sterile saline, no functioning fluoro and no local staff only a ragtag

group of voluntary health providers who like us had made it there on there own,
To summarize we had no clue the medical infrastructure of the country was so
poor.
As we got up and running in the OR and organized the patients for surgery we
communicated our new needs back to Synthes and more supplies were loaded for
a second trip - these included battery operated pulse lavage, a huge supply of
saline, soft goods in the OR. This plane landed as planned sunday pm, equipment
was loaded on a truck and subsequent hijacked between the airport and the
hospital.
At the hospital we had zero security despite promises form NYPD and NYFD to
provide that to us.
Our philosophy was to work like this was a marathon run the OR's around the
clock with the idea that we would have a defined extraction time of llpm
tues. The plane that extracted us would come in with a new medical staff
compliment to replace us. Equipment included urgent things to maximize issues
that were nonexistent in the hospital that would enable us to provide better and
more efficient care:
2 portable anesth machines
2electrocautery
2 portable monitors for the pacu
2autoclaves
Replacement exfix
Things that didn't arive with the previous flight
That planes slot was cancelled by the military at 6am tues.
We also previously had seen daylight in the remaining patients monday night
haviving completed approx 100 surgeries. However on tues morning we found a
huge # of new patients. The hospital was forced to undergo lockdown closing its
gates to the outside and outside crowd becoming angry.
We also noted tues morning that many of the patients we were operating on were
becoming septic.
We finished operating at noon tues, the last surgery our group assisting an
obstetrician on a caesarian and resuscitating a baby that was not breathing.
We decided as a group the situation for us at the hospital was untenable supplies
were running out, team was exhauted, safety a huge concern, and no extraction
plan with resupply. We decided to make our way to airport thru the help of a
hospital benefactor. Jamaican soldiers with M-16 were necessary to escort us out
with our luggage as the crowd outside saw us abandoning the hospital.
We made it to airport on back of a pickup track, got onto the tarmac, hailed a
commercial plane that carried cargo to montreal and had private jet pick us up
there.
The issues we were unprepared for and witnessed were
1. The amount of human devastation
2. The complete lack of a medical infrastructure in the country

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769503 Date: 08/31/2015
3. The lack of support of the haitian medical community
4. The complete lack of any organization on the ground. Noone was in charge,
we had the first functional up and running hospital in the P OP area yet noone and
I me NOONE came to the hospital to assess what we were doing, what we were
capable of doing and what we would need, to be more efficient. The fact that the
military could not or would not protect the resupply equipment on sunday or let
the tues flight come in says it all.
5. Lack of any security at all at the hospital
I would take away that disasters like this need organization on a much higher
level than we had with the clear involvement and approval of the military from
the beginning.
Currently there is Noone obviously running the show and care is in chaotic at
best. MD's are coming in country with no plan of what the are going to
do. Surgeons that expect to just show up and operate are delusional as to what
there role would be as without a complement of support staff and supplies they
would be of limited or no value.
'I hope this helps. We all felt as though we abandoned these patients and that
country and feel terrible. Our role now being back in NY is to expose the
inadequacies of the system to the media in the hopes of effecting a change in this
system immediatly. We feel that the only way to really help now is an urgent
programtic change and organization in the support of the medical staff on the
ground and what is critically needed to expeditiosly bring in.
Cherrios on the tarmac are not getting it done on these patients which clearly
would be savable if good care could urgently be provided.
Please share this email with everyone and anyone you find might help.
Good luck
Dean

Internet Freedom, Hillary Clinton and Being the Web's First Global Diplomat (VIDEO)
When it comes to education and how students learn in the 21st century, when it comes to developing businesses and
encouraging entrepreneurship in a flattening digital marketplace, when it comes to forming social connections
regardless of geographic, linguistic and cultural borders -- when it comes to promoting democracy and protecting the
rights of individuals around the world -- no two words, no other phrase, holds more value. It may sound trite but it's true
-- just ask students and activists in Iran and China. With the Internet comes freedom. With freedom comes the Internet.
In countless ways, for many people, the Internet is freedom.
Hillary Clinton underlined that reality in a bold, impassioned speech at the Newseum in Washington, D.C. this morning.
Words like "bold" and "impassioned" are not usually found in most of the mainstream media's caricature of Clinton.
Nevertheless, the Secretary of State gave by far the most important speech about Internet freedom delivered by a top
U.S. official. What makes it all the more notable is the fact that it was given by arguably the most recognizable female
political figure in the world. In parts of the Middle East, women are beaten and killed by relatives who find out they are
using sites like Twitter and Facebook. "Honor" beatings, they're called.
"Given the magnitude of the challenges we're facing, we need people around the world to pool their knowledge and
creativity to help rebuild the global economy, protect our environment, defeat violent extremism and build a future in
which every human being can realize their God-given potential," said Clinton, who announced a new $15 million project
to help more women, young people and citizen groups to get online. (WATCH: Video of her speech is below.)
Clinton, speaking in broad strokes and finer details, outlined what she called the "five key freedoms of the Internet age."
Freedom to connect online anywhere. Freedom of speech. Freedom of worship.
Freedom from fear of cyber attacks. "In an interconnected world," she said, "an attack on one nation's networks can be
an attack on all."
Freedom of "want" -- which means that the here-comes-everybody ethos of the Web, the fact that we can bear witness
to each other online, can be leveraged in helping relieve suffering worldwide.
On the Twitterverse, where Internet observers and activists commented on Clinton's remarks and her subsequent Q&A
in real time, some took note of her "disappointing" answers regarding China's alleged cyber attacks targeted at human
rights activists. And inevitably, immediate coverage of the speech in our conflict-driven mainstream media, from the
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769504 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769504 Date: 08/31/2015
New York Times to the Associated Press, focused on the China-Google dispute, which is being closely watched by human
rights activists, government officials and Internet companies. But the overall meaning and message of her remarks,
beyond the China-Google stand-off, cannot be overstated. The Internet, after all, was born in America, created by our
researches and funded by our government. With help and input from other countries, the Web's evolving ethos and
guiding principles should be shaped by America -- and, naturally, by America's top diplomat.
"Sec. Clinton once and for all established the fact that free speech and free enterprise can no longer be achieved unless
we have Internet freedom," Andrew Rasiej, founder of the Personal Democracy Forum, an annual conference on
technology's impact on politics and policy, told me shortly after Clinton's remarks. He called her speech nothing short of
a "milestone" in the future of American foreign policy."
"In a world where billions are connected with each other through technology -- through the Internet and mobile phones
-- it is imperative that governments recognize that it's easier and faster for people to connect with each other than for
governments to connect with their citizens. Any government that fails to understand this dynamic will left in the history
books," Rasiej continued."
Less than two weeks ago, Clinton hosted a nearly two-hour dinner for some of the tech industry's leading thinkers and
innovators. It was a small, intimate affair, and guests included Twitter creator Jack Dorsey, Google CEO Eric Schmidt and
Howcast CEO and co-founder Jason Liebman, who wrote about the event for HuffPostTech in a blog titled "Facebook,
YouTube and Twitter Are Tools For Diplomacy." Rasiej was one of the guests. Clinton is interested in how technology can
spur innovation within the State Department and in countries that the U.S.
has interest in supporting, Rasiej said. Accompanying Clinton in the dinner was her senior staff and her growing new
media department; most recently, Katie Jacobs Stanton, a former Google exec who joined the White House as its
director of citizen participation, joined the State Department.
There's a bit of irony at work here. Early in the long, bruising primary campaign that pitted the establishment-backed
former first lady turned New York senator against the little-known insurgent junior senator from Illinois, Clinton was
considered less Web-savvy than Barack Obama. Hers was a top-down, command-and-control operation, online
observers suggested. In fact, the first online attack ad that spread on YouTube and foreshadowed the narrative of their
historic fight for the Democratic nomination portrayed Clinton as the old PC and Obama as the shiny new Mac.
"After having lost to Obama, especially to Obama's use of the Internet in attracting and mobilizing supporters," Rasiej
pointed out, "Clinton is now leading the way within the Obama administration in recognizing the transformational
opportunities that the Internet can provide."
Using DipNote, the State Department's blog, recording videos from all corners of the world, especially where girls and
women are considered second-class citizens, leveraging technological tools that, as we're seeing in the response and
outpouring of support for Haiti, allow us to become "global citizens," Clinton can be the Web's first global diplomat.

Subject: Conversation with Bob Maguire
Cheryl,
I had a good conversation with Bob this afternoon. The major points he wanted to emphasize were the ones he
had included in his emails to you, including:
• "Rebalancing" Haitian development: Redevelopment should occur nationwide and encourage a more
even distribution of the Haitian population. The international community should not rebuild Port-au-
Prince at the expense of the rest of the country. Bob thinks that nationwide rebuilding will also reduce
the chances of elite capture of the rebuilding effort, since elites are strongly concentrated in Port-au-
Prince.
• Transparency: Bob is cautious about just throwing money at the problem. He thinks the international
community should establish a new norm of transparency in Haiti, for example, to ensure that there isn't
widespread corruption, price gauging, grants of monopolies, etc.
• Link the Haitian business community to other business communities: Bob thinks that if all the
rebuilding is done by the usual suspects in the Haitian business community, they'll simply build back the
country they had before. He recommends working to bring in foreign investors, and then linking foreign
investors and leading Haitian businessmen (e.g., in a business roundtable) to socialize better business
practices in Haiti.
• On the issue of legal authorities for reconstruction: Bob recommends exploring whether presidential
commission-like structures could be empowered to resolve the legal problems likely to arise as barriers
to reconstruction.
• Duration of US presence: Bob cautioned that most Haitians would be happy to see a long-term US
military presence in the country, though this would likely have adverse reputational consequences in the
hemisphere for the United States. Given that hurricane season will begin in the fall, Bob recommends
that when we do draw down, we make clear that we will return if needed.
• Getting people to work: Bob argued that NGOs may not be the best vehicles for getting Haitians to
work (e.g., through job training, etc.). In short, they're too nice. Many Haitians have never held a regular
job, are unfamiliar with showing up on time, etc. They'll need a bit of tough love and discipline. Bob
though ex-military might set the right kind of example.

• Diaspora: Engaging the diaspora is clearly important, but we do not want to support widespread
repatriation of the diaspora as NGO employees, reconstruction experts, etc., at the expense of Haitians
who never left. This reinforces wage differentials and social discontent about returnees.
• Conditional cash transfers: Bob thinks that conditional cash transfer programs have a lot of potential
to improve education and the delivery of health services in Haiti.

Dear Hillary,
I just arrived back but my heart and mind are back in Haiti I am thankful that you helped me get there and supported
the resurrection of the hospital in just one week. General Keen was key in reestablishing the hospital (and I got to
appreciate MRE's). When we got there there were 1500 patients and 400 corpses in a deserted hospital — our team of 7
was the only group there.... And slowly over the week we have built a functioning hospital again.
Meeting and working with Paul has been good for the soul---- although when I felt I wanted to meet him –this was not
the way...But I think I am in this for the long haul...
Below is an email for President Clinton (it was good to see him and Chelsea and Mark there) I promised to forward this
email by a medical student he spoke to in the operating room .... Desperate to find a way to continue his education.
Attached is picture of him and I in front of the surgery area. And there were 3 more I met a few nights later who had
volunteered since the first days but had not eaten in a week (I managed to gather bag of biscuits from the world food
program from behind 3 padlocks after 1 hours of searching–They slept on the hospital grounds because their homes
were destroyed.
I am not sure what we can do... But I promised to pass this on!
Thank you for who you are in the world.. God bless you!
Your friend in gratitude,
Mark

celebration of the Community of Democracies. I just wanted to express our appreciation for
your inspirational speech in defense of civil society. Your remarks were warmly received by
the group assembled in Poland and sent an important signal to both friends and adversaries

A media update, CNN just called for a comment after the British rejected the letter. I told CNN that we
provided the team/delegation the waiver letter earlier this afternoon. I quoted from it that the waiver, which
applied to 28 individuals, was a limited authorization for departure from and re-entry in the United States. I

So, there is a sad ending to the story, but I also made clear during the briefing that the unique situation that
they found themselves in stemmed from their decision not to apply for a U.S. passport. I'll keep you updated

PJ,
It is not the ending. We understand that the British have now agreed to
allow those who benefited from our letter (in which we listed those
whom we believe to be American citizens) to go to the UK. (To the best
of my knowledge, the Canadians have not provided a similar letter to
those whom they believe are Canadians.) We believe the group will be
on Delta 0036 directly to Heathrow later today.

A media update, CNN just called for a comment after the British rejected the letter. I told CNN that we
provided the team/delegation the waiver letter earlier this afternoon. I quoted from it that the waiver, which
applied to 28 individuals, was a limited authorization for departure from and re-entry in the United States. I
made clear during the briefing that even though we granted the waiver they needed to gain visas from the UK.

'We're the only ones who believe them'
By: Ben Smith
June 1, 2010 04:44 AM EDT
A delicate diplomatic maneuver by President Barack Obama to smooth frayed relations
with Israel without alienating America's Arab allies may have been blown out of the water
Monday morning by Israel's botched attempt to enforce the Gaza blockade — and by the
lack of condemnation from Washington that followed it.
For while much about the incident remains unclear, a day of carefully parsed statements
from the White House and State Department left at least one irrefutable aftershock: With
much of the world expressing fury over the raid, the contrast with Washington's muted
response could not have been more striking.
"The situation is that they're so isolated right now that it's not only that we're the only ones
who will stick up for them," said an American official. "We're the only ones who believe
them — and what they're saying is true."
The official was referring to Israeli protestations — backed by Israeli Defense Forces video
— that their solders were attacked by passengers on a ship headed for Gaza with
humanitarian aid, when they boarded the ship in what the Israelis concede were
international waters.
Organizers of the flotilla, meanwhile, insisted that participants were unarmed and that
Israeli forces used excessive force.
The timing of the incident had to be viewed with rueful irony among the administration's
Middle East hands. Obama spent this spring damping down concern among American
friends of Israel that his seeming feud with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had
brought the administration to the verge of fundamentally altering the historic U.S. alliance
with the Jewish state. Obama met personally with Jewish members of Congress and
dispatched top officials to Jewish groups to stress the point, as the "anti-Bibi" rhetoric was
simultaneously dialed back precipitously.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769606 Date: 08/31/2015
The charm offensive appears to have worked. But now an administration that itself has
expressed its own fury toward Netanyahu and his government in the past now finds itself
close to sharing Israel's isolation at the moment — a dynamic that could complicate
Obama's outreach to the rest of the region.
Israel's traditional critics denounced the raid — the chief Palestinian peace negotiator,
Saeb Erakat, called it a "war crime" — but so did some the countries Jerusalem counts as
friendly. Turkey's Prime Minister described the incident as an act of "inhuman state terror"
and Ankara withdrew its ambassador to Israel while the Conservative British Foreign
Secretary took the occasion to call the Gaza blockade "unacceptable and counter-
productive."
The White House, in sharp contrast, avoided any hint of criticism of the Israeli action in its
public statements, and American officials appeared sympathetic to Israeli explanations
that their soldiers were attacked by flotilla participants.
The U.S. "deeply regrets the loss of life and injuries sustained" in the Israeli raid, deputy
White House press secretary Bill Burton said in the first of three carefully-modulated
statements Monday, The administration, he said, is "working to understand the
circumstances surrounding this tragedy."
The White House rendition of a call between Obama and Netanyahu also strained to avoid
condemnation, and went out of the way to note that many of those wounded in the
incident "are being treated in Israeli hospitals."
Six hours later, State Department spokesman PJ Crowley issued a third statement, adding
that the U.S. expects that the Israeli government — the unstated emphasis was not the
United Nations — "will conduct a free and credible investigation."
Crowley added an evenhanded paragraph calling on the Israelis to open Gaza to
humanitarian aid, while simultaneously condemning the militant group Hamas, whose
political control of Gaza prompted the blockade.
"Hamas' interference with international assistance shipments and work of
nongovernmental organizations, and its use and endorsement of violence, complicates
efforts in Gaza," Crowley said.
The immediate upshot of the statements from the United States and other countries is that
Obama, perhaps surprisingly, finds himself in the same posture as his predecessors over
the past 60 years — one that holds that the U.S. is far more willing to give the Israelis the
benefit of the doubt on matters of security.
Washington "is always going to be the most reluctant major global actor to condemn
Israeli excesses, and that is the position President Obama finds himself in right now," said
Hussein Ibish, a Senior Fellow at The American Task Force on Palestine.
That position squares with the administration's apparent, reluctant rapprochement with
Israeli's rightist leader — even if that burying of grudges had deep reverberations for the
peace process.

"After wandering around for 15 months, vacillating between pandering to the Israelis and
trying o punish them, they have decided they have to work out some kind of relationship
with Netanyahu that allows them to do something serious," said Aaron David Miller, a
former American peace negotiator. "They need to weather this crisis with the relationship
with the Israelis north of where it is now."
The most immediate challenge, Miller said, will be steering a special session of the UN
Security Council — called by Arab members — away from forcing the U.S. either to vote on
condemning Israel's actions or to veto a resolution condemning them.
Observers of the process expect the U.S. to attempt to craft a resolution that doesn't
condemn Israeli directly and doesn't establish any international investigation, like an
earlier inquiry into Israel's actions in Gaza led by the former South African Judge Richard
Goldstone.
Obama and other American officials stressed the need to study the details of the incident,
as the Israeli government pointed to video of passengers on the ship — which was boarded
in international waters — attacking Israeli commandos with what appeared to be chairs and
metal poles.
"At this point, it is unclear what happened and there must be a thorough investigation,"
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry said in a statement.
Others suggested that further probes may not change the initial reactions. "You can have
an independent commission spend 3 or 4 months studying this thing and come out with
something that is stunningly clear and factual, but it doesn't matter," said Miller. "People
knew where they were before this episode started."

Subject: Brief memo for Cheryl Mills on Colombia - for Secretary Clinton
Dear Cheryl —
In my last email (Friday, 5/28), I attached the letter from the bipartisan Co-Chairs and
Executive Committee members of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission sent to Assistant
Secretary Mike Posner expressing grave concern about the recent rise in death threats, attacks
and murders of Colombian human rights defenders, religious, community and other NGO
leaders. Congressman McGovern also strongly encouraged the Secretary to meet with
representatives of those organizations and individuals being threatened, with a particularly
effort to reach out to and invite the Bishops of Tumaco (Narifio), Barrancabermeja/Medio
Magdalena (Santander), and we would now add Putumayo, since the Colombian Catholic Church
just advised us yesterday of increased death threats against religious workers there. In addition, we
recommended inviting Monsetior Hector Fabio Henao, director of Pastoral Social, at the
Archdiocese in Bogota, who represents all the pastoral work of the Church throughout the country,
as well as representatives from the Mennonite and Lutheran churches, in particular.
While in Colombia, the most important thing the Secretary can do is avoid effusive praise
for President Alvaro Uribe, who leaves office in August. Inside Colombia, the visit by the
Secretary is being described as focusing solely on the free trade agreement and continuing support
of the counterdrug strategy/Plan Colombia. Without changes in the human rights situation and the
culture of impunity, it is unlikely that anything the Secretary might say or do will alter the equation
on Capitol Hill regarding the trade agreement. It should be noted that the October 2008 GAO
report on the counter-drug operations in Colombia concluded that U.S. assistance was successful in
increasing security in parts of the country, but a failure in the areas of counter-narcotics (GAO-09-
71) and a subsequent April 2009 USAID evaluation on U.S. aid for Plan Colombia for illegal crop
reduction and Colombian countemarcotics policies actually contribute to increased coca
production.
The Colombian president has been a solid backer of U.S. policy and U.S. interests in the
region, and has achieved some important improvements in the country's security situation. It is
important to recognize that, but to do so without repeating the tone of Defense Secretary Gates'
April visit, in which he called Uribe a "great hero" and failed even to mention any concerns.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769638 Date: 08/31/2015
These concerns are of critical importance, and while the Secretary need not list them all, at
least some deserve public acknowledgement — some recognition that it is important to the United
States that Colombia, including the current government and its successor, show the necessary
political will to deal with them:
• A sharp rise in alleged military killings of civilians. In many cases, these are so-called "false
positives": non-combatants murdered and later presented as members of armed groups killed
in combat. These, notes UN Special Rapporter for Extrajudicial Executions Philip Alston,
"began occurring with a disturbing frequency across Colombia from 2004." Citing
prosecutors' and NGOs' reports, Alston indicates that Colombia's security forces may have
killed 1,486 civilians during the first six years of Alvaro Uribe's presidency. Alston notes
that the Defense Ministry only began to address the situation after the media broke the story
of the false-positives and the subsequent negative publicity and horrified public outcry.
The prosecution of "false positives" is moving with excruciating slowness. In perhaps the
most notorious case — the murders of about twenty young men from the poor Bogota suburb
of Soacha — nearly all of the accused soldiers and officers have been released from prison,
pending trial, as deadlines for timely prosecution have run out. Since their arrest in late 2008,
their case has been prolonged by numerous delaying tactics by the defense, including
attempts to have their cases tried in the military court system as "acts of service." Alston
reports that the impunity rate on these extrajudicial murders by security forces may be as
high as 98.5 percent.
• Mounting allegations that the President's intelligence service, the DAS, was put at the
service of paramilitary leaders and narcotraffickers; used to spy on and intimidate Supreme
Court justices, opposition politicians, journalists and human rights defenders; and employed
in a campaign of sabotage and smears against political opponents.
Prosecutors are alleging that the orders to have the DAS carry out wiretaps, surveillance and
"political warfare" came from high up in the Colombian presidency, though the question of
"what President Uribe knew, and when he knew it" remains unanswered. Meanwhile efforts
to reform or dissolve the DAS are stalled in Colombia's Congress.
• President Uribe's political coalition has also been hit by a scandal known in Colombia
as "para-politics." This coalition has included dozens of political bosses from regions
beyond the capital. Many are large landholders with ties to narcotrafficking, the same local
leaders who created and fostered the brutal pro-government paramilitary groups that killed
tens of thousands of non-combatants in the 1990s and early 2000s.
Evidence, much of it from former paramilitary leaders, has brought about 300 criminal
investigations against legislators, governors, mayors and other local officials, nearly all of
them Alvaro Uribe's political supporters, who made common cause with the far-right
warlords. To date, of the 278 congresspeople and senators elected in 2006, 68 are under
official investigation, on trial, or convicted for paramilitary ties. Those embroiled in
parapolitics include the President's cousin, Mario Uribe; the brother of his former foreign

minister; and individuals whom the President had named to be Colombia's ambassadors to
Chile, the Dominican Republic, and Canada.
The Colombian prosecutors, investigators, witnesses and non-governmental organizations
trying to uncover the truth about these abuses are working under conditions of great personal risk.
They, too, are heroes and would benefit greatly from a public expression of concern about the
cases they are investigating, and a reminder that their work is legitimate and important to
U.S. interests in Colombia.
At the same time, it is important to avoid appearing to endorse any candidate in the June
20 runoff elections. Between the first and second rounds of a country' s presidential election is a
politically awkward time for a high-level official visit. Though President Uribe's former defense
minister, Juan Manuel Santos, is the overwhelming favorite given his margin of success in the May
301first round of balloting over former Bogota mayor Antanas Mockus, it is necessary at this stage
to convey a sense of balance and a willingness to work closely with whoever wins. As a result, any
kind words for one candidate should be balanced by praise for the other.
Finally, it would be helpful to remind the Colombian people that the United States
supports a peaceful resolution of Bogota's worsening differences with Venezuela. While
President Chavez' s behavior is a significant concern, it would be most unhelpful to be perceived on
this trip as fanning the flames of conflict with Colombia — or playing into the Chavez rhetoric that
the U.S. and Colombia have military aspirations in the region.
Hope this memo, along with last week's copy of the TLHRC letter to Assistant Secretary
Posner, are helpful and useful materials for the Secretary as she plans her trip.
Very best wishes —
On behalf of Cong. Jim McGovern

Cheryl, Bellerive hit me up before the beginning of a donors' meeting this morning to say that it's important that the US
troops in country be covered by a bilateral agreement that defines, among other things, their immunities.
He noted that
we have had SOFAs covering every military exercise in Haiti since he has been in government.
His critics have been on the radio
daily accusing him and Preval of selling out Haiti's sovereignty by allowing foreign troops into the country.

Subject: PM Bellerive on Donors' Conference, SOFA, adoptions, migrants, political dilema and more
I was in three meetings today with Prime Minister Jean Max Bellerive and he made the following points:
Donors' Confab: The GOH would like to hold the donors' pledging conference in New York on April 15. They have
discounted their original date (March 22-23) because there is an IDB meeting in Mexico City on those same dates. There
is a technical donors' meetings in Santo Domingo on April 14, and the GOH would like the pledging session to come after
it. Bellerive said the GOH would also be open to doing the pledging session on March 31, though they prefer April 15.
Status of Forces Agreement: Bellerive asked me if we could propose to the GOH a SOFA covering US troops in Haiti. 1.4(D)
B1
I told him we would consult and get back to him ASAP.
Adoptions: Bellerive signed the two lists of humanitarian parole letters I brought him, 1.4(B)
asking if we are close to finishing all the kids in the pipeline. In a later meeting with multiple donors Bellerive 1.4(D)
talked about the case of the ten Amcits being held for allegedly trying to take Haitian children out of the country without B1
authorization. He said that this case is in the hands of the courts and that the Executive has no influence over the
outcome, but said it is an example of the GOH's need to control the problem of child trafficking which he said has
increased exponentially since the earthquake. He said the judge has three months to decide the case. He has already
dropped the most serious charge of kidnapping, and now the charges "only carry a maximum of 15 years in prison." He
said that the judge might determine that there isn't enough evidence in the case to try the Amcits. He said that the only
power the Executive has in the case would be a presidential pardon in the event they are found guilty. He would not
speculate on whether Preval would consider a pardon if the Amcits are found guilty.
Migrants: He approved the return to Haiti of 62 Haitian migrants detained on Great Exuma and said repatriations
should continue as pre-earthquake normal.
Relations with Dominican Republic: On instructions, I asked Bellerive in private what the GOH believed would be the
appropriate role of the Dominican Republic in donor coordination mechanisms. 1.4(B)
1.4(D)
B1
Political dilemma: The executive decree establishing a state of urgency expires on February 15 and can only be
extended by Parliament. Parliament has been fiercely critical of the Preval/Bellerive government since the disaster, and
This leaves the
government with the dilemma of how to handle extraordinary disaster needs (such as declaring land of public utility)
after February 15. UN SRSG Mullet encouraged Bellerive to seek a "full consensus" with the opposition as "nothing
short of unanimity" would be required to address the enormous challenges Haiti is facing.
Bellerive told the donor community that the GOH may soon have to choose between
becoming totally ineffective (which he said they will not do) or taking actions that exceed the authority given to the
Executive by the law (which he implied they are prepared to do). The government is meeting with the private sector to
get their approval of their reconstruction strategy, recognizing that they will have great difficulty getting a consensus
with the political parties. Bellerive said that the GOH is also evaluating what to do about upcoming elections and
constitutional reform, but implied that they have more time to reach a decision on these matters.

B1
Preval to address the nation: The government is going to designate February 12 (the month anniversary of the quake)
as a day of national mourning and President Preval will make his first formal address to the nation since the
disaster. They are drafting his speech to be part mourning and part the vision of the future. Preval wants to announce
that all the ministries are up and running as usual.
Ministries: The PM said that the Primature and the Ministry of Planning will be moving into the old US Embassy
building. The courts will move into the old USAID building. The plan to move a number of the ministries out to Croix des
Bouquets has met with very little enthusiasm from the main line ministries. They prefer to clear the rubble off of their
properties in downtown Port-au-Prince and either build new buildings (EU is offering to finance) or put up temporary
structures (Canada is offering to finance).

it. I would hope that a way could be found to raise the issue.
Is Alec Ross going to be traveling with S to Saudi? If so, maybe he could do a meeting with a group of bloggers and/or
online journalists.
Riyadh moves to regulate net news

Saudi Arabia is planning to introduce regulations that include licensing internet news sites in a bid to bring them
under government control. Ali Jarekji / Reuters
RIYADH // Saudi Arabia is planning to introduce regulations, including a licensing requirement, for its
indigenous internet news sites, which have become a key fixture in the kingdom's active online community.
The draft regulations, still under study, would require internet-based news sites to request a government licence
and to respond to complaints about their content that are received by the ministry of culture and information.
"We want them to feel that they are under our umbrella," Abdul Rahman al Hazza, spokesman for the ministry,
said in a phone interview yesterday.
Mr al Hazza referred to the new rules as "guidelines for the e-press", and said the idea is to help the electronic
media with staffing and financing and give them "somebody to talk to" if they have problems. "It's going to be
simple and easy."

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769770 Date: 08/31/2015
Asked if the new rules would involve censorship, Mr al Hazza replied: "Not that much." Mainly, he added, if
there are complaints about something written at an online news site, "we just look at it".
A report last year in the Saudi Gazette said the draft regulations also cover "appointment conditions for editors-
in-chief, granting permits to journalists, and invitations to cover news events".
A 2007 law already subjects online writers to criminal penalties for such things as defamation.
The planned regulations, which Mr al Hazza said are still two to three months away from being finalised by the
ministry, are an effort to bring online news sites such as Sabq, Alweeam and A'ajel under government control
in much the same way that the country's traditional daily newspapers are regulated.
It is not clear if news sites like Elaph.com, which is London-based but has a Riyadh office, would also have to
get a licence.
Saudi newspapers are licensed by the government and can be temporarily stopped from publishing if they print
something upsetting to a government official. But this has been rare in recent years, during which the Saudi
print media has been encouraged to report more critically on social and economic problems. There is
considerable self-censorship, however, as the media stay away from sensitive issues.
Although the draft regulations under consideration do not apply to bloggers, there are concerns that the
government eventually will try to regulate them as well.
"They are not talking about blogs" right now, observed one veteran Saudi blogger, Ahmed Ba-Aboud. "But
eventually they will get to us. It is a concern."
Mr Ba-Aboud, 38, a management consultant in the kingdom's Eastern Province city of Dhahran, said the
government does not understand that online media are attracting readers because they are not controlled like
traditional newspapers. "There's no way I'd send anything I write to the government to censor it," he said.
"That's not how the internet works."
Ahmed al Omran, who blogs at www.saudijeans.org, was caustic about what he called the ministry's "dumb
idea to regulate so-called electronic media".
"Ironically, some owners of news websites are actually pushing for this law," Mr Omran lamented in a posting
last month.
"They argue that it would make it easier for them to get funding and make money from advertising. What about
their independence and freedom that could be threatened by the new law? Well, apparently these things are not
high on their agenda."
Saudi Arabia's sprightly blogging community includes both Saudis and foreigners writing in both Arabic and
English. It also boasts one of the region's highest proportion of female bloggers — about 46 per cent, according
to a 2009 study by Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet and Society. About one-third of the
kingdom's population regularly goes online.
The community's latest arrival showed up February 2, when Mr Ba-Aboud launched a new English-language
blog so that outsiders can learn more about "regular people like myself'.
Most foreigners know certain kinds of Saudis, Mr Ba-Aboud said in an interview, including "extremists like
Osama bin Laden", "rich people" and "people related to the government".

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769770 Date: 08/31/2015
But the voice of ordinary Saudis "does not reach around the globe in a similar magnitude", he wrote at the new
site, http://alternativesaudivoices.wordpress.com.
It will be a sort of communal blog in that Mr Ba-Aboud has invited anyone to contribute a posting, and as co-
ordinator, he will post them on the site. Only those that "call for hate or violence" will be rejected, he added.
In an interview last November, Mr al Hazza, the ministry spokesman, said the new regulations arose partly
because ordinary citizens "don't know where to go" to complain about something written at an online news site.
"The problem we have is that there is no government department to refer to ... Nobody to evaluate their job to
see if they are doing wrong or right."
Censorship "is not the idea" behind the new rules, he said. "The idea is to regulate."
Mr al Ha7za said a decision will probably be made in the next couple of weeks about whether the new
regulations shall be issued by the minister of culture and information, Abdel Aziz al Khoja, or be sent to the
Shoura Council for action.
Meanwhile, anyone wanting to send Mr al Khoja a comment on the new rules can reach him at his personal
page at Facebook

Subject: Bloomberg-South America Leaders Propose Haiti Aid, Avoid Strife (Update3)
By Alexander Cuadros
Feb. 9 (Bloomberg) -- South American leaders agreed to provide $300 million in aid to Haiti at a summit in Ecuador after
skirting regional disputes that have undermined relations on the continent since 2008.
The 12 members of the Union of South American Nations, or Unasur, endorsed an accord today calling for a $100 million
fund as well as a $200 million "preferential" credit from the Inter-American Development Bank. The money would be
channeled to programs benefiting Haiti's reconstruction in areas such as agriculture, electricity infrastructure, health
and education.
"Latin America has stood up," Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa said, addressing the summit at his presidential palace.
"The time has come to create a new kind of south-south aid."

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769799 Date: 08/31/2015
The meeting marks Colombian President Alvaro Uribe's first visit to Ecuador since his armed forces staged a cross-border
raid on a guerrilla camp there almost two years ago. The attack killed rebel leader Raul Reyes, prompted Correa to break
off ties with his northern neighbor and led Venezuela's Hugo Chavez to order tanks to his country's border with
Colombia.
Leaders including Organization of American States Secretary General Jose Miguel Insulza said today aid efforts should
follow instructions from the government of Haitian President Rene Preval, who attended the meeting. Correa said
member nations should scrap tariffs on Haitian imports and consider subsidizing natural gas exports to the Caribbean
nation.
IDB Support
Carlos Melo, the IDB's representative in Ecuador, said he spoke to bank chief Luis Alberto Moreno, who supported a 15-
to 20-year $200 million credit to be taken on by Unasur. Correa said member countries should consider contributing 25
cents per inhabitant to the $100 million fund.
Chavez canceled his attendance because of an electricity crisis he's facing at home, Ecuadorean Foreign Minister Ricardo
Patino told reporters today. At a gathering in Argentina last August, Chavez assailed a deal allowing the U.S. access to
seven Colombian military bases, saying it was part of a strategy to dominate the region.
About 100 protesters gathered today outside the presidential palace, carrying signs reading "Uribe equals the threat of
war" and chanting criticisms of Correa for receiving his Colombian counterpart.
Regional Integration
Unasur was formed two years ago in a bid to promote regional integration. In 2008, at a summit in Santiago, the group
provided political backing to Bolivian President Evo Morales after clashes between his supporters and government
opponents over a new constitution left 30 people dead.
The leaders of the continent's two biggest economies skipped today's talks. Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de
Kirchner has canceled foreign travel amid a political dispute over control of the central bank's reserves.
Brazilian President Luiz lnacio Lula da Silva isn't attending because of conflicts in his agenda, according to his press
office. He sent his top foreign policy adviser, Marco Aurelio Garcia, to represent him.
No bilateral meeting is planned between Correa and Uribe, Ecuador's state news agency cited Patino as saying Feb. 4.
Unasur countries rushed doctors, food and emergency supplies to Haiti, the hemisphere's poorest country, in the
aftermath of the Jan. 12 earthquake. At least 200,000 people died in the quake, Haiti's government said Feb. 6.
Brazil Aid
Lula signed a, decree Jan. 26 providing 375 million reais ($200 million) in aid to Haiti. Brazil, which leads a United Nations
peacekeeping contingent in Haiti, had already pledged about $17 million to the country, the most among Latin American
nations, according to UN data.
Venezuela forgave Haiti's oil-related debt and donated 225,000 barrels of fuel, while Colombia sent more than 200
search-and-rescue personnel and committed hundreds of tons of humanitarian supplies. Ecuador has sent rescue teams
and donated several tons of food, UN data show. Peruvian President Alan Garcia, speaking at the summit today, said
Peru was willing to contribute $10 million.

Colombia and Ecuador began taking steps late last year to restore full relations. The neighbors named diplomatic envoys
and re-established military ties in November. Ecuador this month also eliminated the last of the tariffs it imposed on
Colombian goods in 2009.

FW: Rahm's long goodbye
Rahm's long goodbye
By: Glenn Thrush
June 22, 2010 04:34 AM EDT
For all the talk about Rahm Emanuel reaching for the "eject" button, the fiery White House
chief of staff isn't leaving in the immediate future — and could serve well into 2011,
according to people close to him.
"It's the opinion in the top levels of the White House that Rahm is going to be here longer
than many people think," said a senior administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
Speculation about Emanuel's departure has been a favorite parlor game for nearly a year
— stoked by Emanuel's admission that he'd love to run for Chicago mayor (should current'
Mayor Richard Daley retire, of course), his own kvetching about the rigors of the job,
withering attacks on him from the left and the right and the fact that the average expiration
date on a chief of staff is 18 months.
Emanuel is leaving, but his departure date has proved to be profoundly elastic. Friends
and co-workers said he vacillates from day to day, sometimes minute to minute. He might
leave in December after the midterms; or he might stay until next summer, depending on
whether Daley runs or President Barack Obama asks him to stick around, they said.
And even as he pines for his native Chicago, Emanuel continues to put down real roots in
D.C., recently writing the check to enroll his children in the exclusive Maret School in
Washington through the 2011 school year, according to a person close to Emanuel.
He's shown few signs of loosening his grip on the tiller — bombarding White House
staffers with long-distance calls during the first days of the Gulf oil spill even as he
traveled in Israel for his son's bar mitzvah.
And in a broader sense, it's hard to imagine Emanuel's huge personality extracted from
the political, journalistic and bar stool life of Obama's Washington.
Take the last game of last week's NBA Finals, when any American voter could wander
into Tunnicliff's Tavern on Capitol Hill and witness one of the most powerful men in the
nation egging on the Boston Celtics — screaming at the flat-screen TV, actually — joined

by a merry band that included Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.); Sen. Chris Dodd (D-Conn.);
Jim Manley, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.); and a pair of
favorite reporters from The New York Times and The Washington Post.
Despite a British tabloid story asserting that Emanuel is sick of Obama's "idealism" and is
racing for the exit, the former Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman
still loves the attention and power of his current job and hasn't made up his mind when
he's leaving, people who know him said.
"This is BS. And if you need it for translation, it is baseless," Emanuel said in a statement
pushing back against a story in the U.K.'s Daily Telegraph portraying Emanuel as restless!
and fed up.
Replacing Emanuel, when he eventually goes, will be no easy task for Obama and the
small clique of close advisers led by Pete Rouse, David Axelrod and Valerie Jarrett.
For one thing, Obama and company need to know what the post-November political
landscape looks like before picking a successor: If Republicans take back one or more
house of Congress, the new chief of staff will need to know how to leverage executive
power against a hostile Hill; if Democrats retain their majorities, Emanuel's successor will
need some of his legislative skills.
Barring a major course correction, Obama, who prizes loyalty and familiarity, isn't likely to
reach too far outside his inner circle, advisers said.
Still, the president is increasingly cognizant of his reputation for insularity and would quite
likely give a serious look at respected former Clinton chiefs of staff Leon Panetta, currenW
head of the CIA, or John Podesta, who runs the Center for American Progress, a major
liberal think tank with close ties to the administration.
Rouse, a senior adviser who served as Obama's Senate chief of staff, is considered the
best pure manager in the White House and a logical choice to replace Emanuel, according
to a half-dozen.administration officials and consultants.
But Rouse's colleagues say the quiet 60-year-old insider loves his work, the Grateful Dead
and his cats — but despises the spotlight and would most likely turn down the job unless
Obama insisted.
"The key thing about Pete is that the president trusts him and would feel very, very
comfortable with him in charge," said a Democratic consultant who knows both men well.
"But he probably won't take it."
One possible candidate — deputy chief of staff Jim Messina, Emanuel's political go-to guy
— is likely to play a major role in Obama's 2012 reelection campaign and is expected to
move to Chicago sometime next year.
In Messina's absence, another Emanuel favorite — Deputy National Security Adviser Tom
Donilon — has emerged as a possible successor, according to people close to the
situation.
Obama has been impressed by Donilon's presentations at the President's Daily Briefing,
and the Rhode Island native has a wide variety of political and governmental experience,
serving as a congressional liaison under President Jimmy Carter, chief State Department

spokesman under President Bill Clinton and a campaign adviser who helped Obama
prepare for debates against John McCain.
One major Donilon drawback: He served as an executive vice president for Fannie Mae,
the bailed-out mortgage giant, and reportedly lobbied against stronger regulatory
oversight.
David Plouffe, Obama's 2008 campaign manager, is another contender, with a reputation
for discipline, team building and solid management skills. But Plouffe has been reluctant to
settle down in Washington, is earning a stellar living as a consultant and hates the press.
Former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle is also a possible successor, even though
his nomination for Health and Human Services secretary was scuttled by revelations he
failed to report limo rides paid for by a corporate client.
Another White House aide, Phil Schiliro, is a favorite of Obama's for his legislative savvy
and political instincts. But critics said he lacks the range of policy and political experience
that other candidates possess, and that his mastery of the Hill won't mean much if
Democrats surrender their majorities in either house.
Then there's Ron Klain, 49, Vice President Joe Biden's brainy and politically astute chief
of staff, who is said to be intensely interested in making the move from the Eisenhower
Executive Office Building to the West Wing.
Klain — who also served as Al Gore's chief of staff — is well-regarded inside the White
House. Plus, he's got a touch of star power: Kevin Spacey played him in the HBO movie
"Recount," about his role in guiding the Gore campaign through the 2000 Florida recount.
Klain's downside: He's essentially an outsider who has yet to develop a serious rapport
with the president, according to insiders.

Dear Cheryl:
I have been asked by the Turkish Embassy, who I represent, to request a meeting with Secretary Clinton for Mrs. Umit
Boyner, a prominent Turkish business woman. Such a meeting could be whenever and wherever you determine most
convenient for the Secretary — either in Washington, DC or Turkey.
As you will see from the biographical information below, Mrs. Boyner has had a distinguished career as a
businesswoman, and she has also devoted time to philanthropy as well. Mrs. Boyner was recently selected to be the
chair person of the board of one of the most prominent Turkish business organizations, the Turkish Industrialists' and
Businessmen's Association (TUSIAD) — an organization comparable to the Business Roundtable. I have also attached a
document providing additional background information on TUSIAD.
Mrs. Umit is a great admirer of Secretary Clinton's and would be extremely honored to be able to meet with her. I know
the Secretary is extremely busy, but I hope she can find a window to meet with Mrs. Urnit. Thanks for all you help and
my personal regards to Secretary Clinton.
Best,
Dick

Bay Area execs seek to open doors with Syria
Andrew S. Ross
Sunday, June 20, 2010
Call it a dual purpose mission, with pretty high stakes.
Bay Area executives fromCisco Systems Inc.,Symantec Corp. andVeriSign Inc. returned Friday
from a trip to Syria, where they were tasked by the Obama administration with helping open business
and diplomatic doors to a member of what used to be called the "axis of evil."
Were the doors flung open to a country with whom U.S. businesses are still mostly forbidden to trade?
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769938 Date: 08/31/2015

Not exactly, given that Internet freedom, transparency, the elimination of corruption and a general
opening up, Syrian leaders were told, are among the sine qua non for getting them what they say they
want - U.S. businesses and investment there.
"Candid" was a word used by one delegation member to describe the four days of talks last week in
Damascus and Aleppo, a commercial center and Syria's largest city. "They provided a lot of clarity for
both sides. On our side, how receptive the Syrians are to U.S. companies doing business there, and for
the Syrians, what they need to do to get things going," said the delegation member, who agreed to
speak only on background.
The delegation, which also included senior executives fromMicrosoft Corp. andDell Inc., was led
byAlec Ross, Secretary of StateHillary Rodham Clinton's senior adviser for innovation,
andJared Cohen, a member of Clinton's policy planning staff.
There were sit-downs with Syrian PresidentBashar Assadand other government ministers and
meetings with business leaders, including those in the country's nascent high-tech sector, along with
students, academics and leaders of civic and social organizations.
Laying down the conditions:Unlike most U.S. companies, Cisco, Symantec and the other high-
tech firms on the trip are allowed to do business in Syria under a waiver granted, under certain
conditions, to U.S. information technology companies.
According to Syria's state news agency, Sana, "the American executives discussed setting up
authorized centers for (their) companies in Syria."
But in meeting after meeting, according to the delegate, the executives said there were too many
barriers to entry, including Internet access, which Clinton has said is a key plank of U.S. foreign
policy.
"They can't do business in a place that is not open," was the message, according to the delegate.
(While Syria remains a member in good standing of the axis of authoritarians, some of the same
concerns could be raised about countries these companies do conduct business with - like, dare we
say, China).
The Syrian government said it was considering a law that would require that the blocking of Web sites
- a common, often arbitrary and unpredictable happening there - be at least subject to judicial review.
"Now, we have to wait and see what the government does," the delegate said.
In an earlier statement about the trip, Symantec said it was also designed to help the Obama
administration's "effort to continue strengthening diplomatic relations throughout the Middle East."
That also remains to be seen.

It's not the first time the administration, responding to come-hither hints from Damascus, has, like
Charlie Brown, teed up the football, only to have it snatched away, Lucy-style, as Syria got cold and
persisted in allying itself with U.S. archenemy Iran.
Obama, announcing the renewal of sanctions on Syria last month, cited the country's "continuing
support for terrorist organizations and pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and missile programs,
(which) continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy
and economy of the United States."
Opportunities in the sand:Meanwhile,Robert Ludden, chief operating officer of San
Francisco'sKMD Architects, is back in the Middle East seeking more business, particularly in
Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia.
Recently Ludden nailed down the firm's first prime contract there, as designer of the $15 million
Imperial College of London diabetes center in Abu Dhabi, a showpiece facility for a disease that is
surprisingly prevalent in the region.
He sees the Middle East as a growing market for architects and designers, as a number of countries
there, especially the desert kingdoms, are seeking to develop sustainable communities.
"Saudi Arabia is the next big one," Ludden says.
Going global:TheBay Area Councilofficially opened its first "overseas global office" on Friday, in
Shanghai.
The office, located in Shanghai's Knowledge and Innovation Community, is meant to serve as a
gateway service for Bay Area companies looking to set up in China, as well as "guiding Chinese
companies and investment to the Bay Area."
Next up for a global office, the council says: India.

Haiti prez to extend term if election not held JONATHAN M. KATZ,Associated Press Writer
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) El Haitian President Rene Preval said Wednesday he will stay in office up to three months
past the end of his term if his earthquake-ravaged nation does not hold a presidential election as scheduled.
His aide said the extension is needed to avoid chaos in case a ballot cannot be held to choose Preval's successor. The
announcement set off an outcry from opposition lawmakers, who called the move unconstitutional and compared
Preval to brutal dictators of the past.
Preval's five-year term is scheduled to end Feb. 7. But electoral officials are struggling to hold the election as scheduled
this fall as it copes with the loss of its headquarters and records, destroyed polling places and some 1.6 million displaced
or deceased voters.
The electoral council, now operating out of a gym seized in a drug raid, is also embroiled in controversy. Opposition
candidates barred from February legislative elections that were canceled after the quake have accused council members
of favoring Preval's newly formed Unity party. One council member also faces dismissal on charges of embezzlement.
In a decree dated Tuesday, the 67-year-old Preval said that if an election is not held before Nov. 28 he can remain in
office for an extra three months 13 until May 14, 2011. That date falls five years after Preval's delayed 2006 inauguration,
which was pushed back by wrangling over the vote count.
"If President Preval were to leave on Feb. 7, while the new president is not elected, we would find ourselves in an
impossible situation," his chief of staff, Fritz Longchamp, said.
He said Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive and Cabinet members who signed the decree "want to make sure that the
country is not going to slip into chaos."

Opposition lawmakers slammed the decision. Senator Youri Latortue said the move violated the constitution and
pledged to challenge it before Haiti's supreme court.
Acluche Louis-Jeune, a deputy with the Struggling People's Organization party, told Haiti's Channel 11 that Preval is
trying to stay in office to profit from the $12.7 billion-and-counting pledged in reconstruction aid.
"He's trying to make himself president for life like (ex-dictators Francois and Jean-Claude) Duvalier," he said.
Longchamp said Parliament's approval is needed for the extension, but lawmakers will have to act fast: On Monday all
seats in the lower chamber and a third of the seats in the Senate expire. The Feb. 28 election to replace them could not
be held because of the chaos following the Jan. 12 earthquake.
Preval also served as president from 1995 to 2000. He stepped down as scheduled when his term ended and handed
power back to the man who preceded him, the re-elected Jean-Bertrand Aristide.

Clinton equates LGBT rights to human rights
Chris Johnson I Jun 22, 2010 I Comments 0
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Tuesday equated the pursuit of LGBT rights to the pursuit of human rights
as she celebrated Pride month with gay State Department employees.
During a speech, Clinton said her belief that LGBT rights are synonymous with human rights as a whole is
consistent with remarks she made as first lady in favor of women's rights during a visit to China.
"Just as I was very proud to say the obvious more than 15 years ago in Beijing that human rights are women's
rights — and women's rights are human rights — let me say today that human rights are gay rights and gay
rights are human rights," she said.
Clinton made her remarks during a State Department event commemorating June as Pride month. Gays &
Lesbians in Foreign Affairs Agencies, the affinity group for LGBT employees at the State Department,
coordinated the event.
The secretary compared LGBT rights to human rights after describing discrimination and oppression that many
people face in other countries. She said these abuses sometimes consist of people being "harassed, beaten,
subjected to sexual violence — even killed — because of who they are and who they love."
"In some places, violence against the LGBT community is permitted by law and inflamed by public calls to
violence," she said. "In others, it persists insidiously behind closed doors. These dangers are not gay issues.
This is a human rights issue."

Clinton was well received by the more than 400 people who attended the State Department event. She received
a standing ovation before and after her speech.
The secretary said she's been "greatly motivated" by the personal stories of LGBT people over her lifetime and
that they helped shape the course of her political career.
She recalled how as a first lady she marched in a Pride parade — something a first lady had never done before
— and noted she co-sponsored a number of pro-LGBT bills in her previous role as a U.S. senator from New
York, including hate crimes bill and the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.
In an effort to continue that commitment to LGBT people, Clinton said the State Department would "advance a
comprehensive human rights agenda" that would include an end to violence and discrimination based on sexual
orientation and gender identity.
She said efforts to confront this oppression consist of "elevating our human rights dialogues" with foreign
governments to protect LGBT people as well as documenting anti-gay abuses in the State Department's annual
human rights report.
One of the arms of the State Department that Clinton commended for taking the lead at confronting anti-gay
abuses was the Bureau of African Affairs, which she said directed every U.S. embassy in Africa to report on the
conditions of local LGBT communities. Clinton noted that she's asked every regional bureau "to make this
issue a priority."
Clinton said Foreign Service officers in the State Department are siding with pro-LGBT groups overseas despite
threats to personal safety. She cited the participation of U.S. officials last month in Slovakia's first ever Pride
parade as one example.
"There were anti-gay protesters who became violent and the police used tear gas, which our chargee and other
diplomats were exposed to — a quite unpleasant experience, but a service to a just cause," she said.
On the domestic front, Clinton recognized that many LGBT Americans feel frustrated on the lack of progress on
advancing LGBT issues. Still, Clinton urged patience and said much progress has already been made.
"I know when you're in the midst of a great movement of change, it seems like it is glacial, but any fair
assessment — from my perspective, and I lived longer than at least more than 75 percent of you — is that it is
extraordinary what has happened in such a short period of time," she said.
Clinton said the U.S. has come "such a far distance" in advancing LGBT rights, but said are there many people
within the country who need outreach and support to "stand up and be who they are."
"The struggle for equality is never, ever finished," she said. "And it is rarely easy, despite how self-evident it
should be, but the hardest fought battles often have the biggest impact."
The secretary encouraged LGBT people to look out for others who may need a hand — such as LGBT youth,
whom Clinton said "still, in numbers far beyond what should ever happen, take their own lives rather than live
that life."
"So, I hope that each and every one of us will recommit ourselves to building a future in which every person —
every single person — can live in dignity, free from violence, free to be themselves, free to live up to their God-
given potential — wherever they live and whoever they are," she said.

Hi, Cheryl —
Thank you so much for your excellent introduction of the Secretary today, and for your support of the good
work of GLIFFA. As always, the Secretary was brilliant and inspiring. Would it be possible for you to pass on a
word to her on my behalf?
You may remember that I am working in the Office of Children's Issues, B6
particularly on international child abduction. You and I were in contact in March 2009, and we discussed then
the possibility of talking with the Secretary about the work we do here in our office. That did not work out,
and I of course understood, but I would like to thank her for her interest in and support of our work, both in
abduction and inter-country adoption.
On a personal note. I wanted the Secretary to know

But I want to let
the Secretary know that I am especially grateful for all the work she has done for the GLBT community in the
Department and around the world. What a thrill it was to today to hear her say that gay rights are human
rights!
We are indeed at an exciting point in history. Please extend my thanks to the Secretary for her leadership.
All the best,

Hi, Cheryl —
The Office of Children's Issues is in the Bureau of Consular Affairs, Overseas Citizens' Services, and we are the only office
that handles child abductions in the Department. Our office is in SA-29 at 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Fourth
floor. We are the U.S. Central Authority for two Hague Conventions, the Child Abduction Convention and the
Intercountry Adoption Convention. Our office is currently handling more than 1600 open international child abduction
cases from the U.S. and about 400 cases of abductions of children into the U.S. under the Hague Convention. We're very
busy! Come see us!

S. Remarks to participants at High Level Meeting on Food Security for All
President Obama has made clear that alleviating hunger worldwide is a top priority of this Administration. As he said on
the first day of his Presidency, "to the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms
flourish and let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds." The President and I intend to focus
new attention on food security so that developing nations can invest in food production, affordability, accessibility,
education and technology.

If she feels strongly, sure
Otherwise I vote no. We aren't directly part of this unfortunate saga, don't need to be. Once again she and Gates
come across as the mature ones. The questions they have for her on her recommendation, etc would be addressed by
a statement.
Besides, she'll answer this on camera tomorrow
I would however add Petreaus to her call sheet even though I'm sure she saw him at the WH, so we can reinforce her
relationship with him going forward
We also need to stress their solid working relationship - I believe he was here last week and we thankfully put that on
her schedule

what he did in Iraq; his health; political benefits of locking him up like Huntsman; etc

Had McC weathered this, there would have been more emphasis on #2. With Petreaus there, there's an air of adult
management so there will be less of that. whether there will B5
be other changes to the team, how they get along with Petraeus and my strong suggestion to all involved is that this
change is a fresh start for all. That ends the conversation.

representatives of "embattled NGOs" in the balcony of the Slowacki Theater, and many were literally awe-struck. They
told me that it was the most important, most inspirational speech they had ever heard relating to civil society. I agree.
I realize that considerable behind-the-scenes work goes into a speech like this. While civil society has an important role
in critiquing governmental actions, I also think that it's important to recognize the efforts of our remarkable colleagues
in government. So please allow me to say "thank you" to you and your team. Please also know that you can count on
ICNL to redouble its efforts - within the CD Working Group and otherwise - to advance the objectives set forth in

Dear Cheryl,
Good morning as another full week begins for both of us, but particularly for you and the distinguished Secretary.
Hillary's interview on Meet the Press was flawless as was the cover story in Newsweek. Her great pictures are matching
her thoughtful words.
Cheryl it is my understanding that
President of the IDB. Assuming this information is accurate (and I believe it is) I think this puts the US in a difficult and
awkward position not to be agreeable to Luis' continued leadership at the IDB. We are simply unnecessarily complicating
a relationship and situation in the hemisphere in my humble opinion.
I wanted to be certain you were aware of this development and would appreciate any thoughts or guidance you have as

than Michael Lewis' current book, which speaks more to the personalities involved).

We did a couple of holding actions today regarding this legislation. The Secretary said we have the authority to do what
is called expatriation. US citizenship is a privilege not a right. Where you swear to uphold duties to our Constitution.
Those who support terrorism are in violation in the Secretary's opinion. We will take a hard look at what is proposed. At
the podium, I said that there were issues regarding due process and that Americans would be concerned if citizenship
were revoked before as opposed to after a legal proceeding.

Kurt and Cheryl,
In my meeting yesterday with FM Smith, he said he'd still like to speak with S. Originally, they were scheduled
to talk last Friday but it was cancelled. Given the change in leadership, and Smith's increased responsibility --
taking on trade and aid portfolios as well as foreign affairs -- I think a brief call would be helpful.
Also, I spoke at length with former PM Rudd on Monday. Although he did not raise the issue, his aide called
Edgard afterward and noted that Rudd had not heard from S, and would have hoped for a sympathetic call. I
have no strong point of view on this one. He has received such a call from POTUS already.
But, I think he and S had a good relationship and he may want to talk to her about his future career
goals.
Best,
J.

PROVAL RATINGS FOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS DROP ACROSS THE BOARD
3Poll of "news watchers" — a nationwide survey of registered voters who say they follow the news "closely" or "very closely" — finds that the job
ratings of President Obama, his top aides and Cabinet officials have fallen considerably during the past seven months.
The July 2010 Clams Poll shows that only two members of the Obama team, Secretary of State Hilary Clinton (64 percent) and Defense Secretar}
Robert Gates (56 percent), were surveyed to have job approval ratings of more than 50 percent.
Clinton, Obama's opponent in the 2008 Democratic primaries, received the highest job rating in the "news watchers" survey, but her 64 percent ra
the July 2010 poll is down 11 points since the December 2009 Clams Inner Circle poll.
Gates, who is second with a 56 percent approval rating, suffered the biggest drop —down 13 points since December.
President Obama, who scored a 45 percent job approval rating in the July 2010 poll, is down 6 points from where he was seven months ago.

Clinton and Gates owe their higher ratings to stronger bipartisan appeal. Clinton received 45 percent approval from Republicans and 57 percent fn
independents. Gates scored 45 percent from both Republicans and independents.
Both Obama and Clinton posted 90 percent approval scores among Democrats. Gates, who was first appointed to his current job by GOP President
George W. Bush, received a 76 percent approval rating from Democratic news watchers.
Obama's ratings were more politically polarized: The president received a 35 percent job approval from independents and a dismal 14 percent frot
Republicans. Obama won the 2008 election by drawing 52 percent of independent voters.
In addition to Clinton and Gates, the only other administration official to have higher approval than disapproval ratings is Press Secretary Robert C
(43 percent to 34 percent).
Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar, who has been on the hot seat because of the Gulf oil spill, scored the lowest job rating (22 percent) of all tho

Student Beats The Odds
Jelani Freeman lived in 6 foster homes in 10 years

WASHINGTON - Jelani Freeman has gone through a lot to wear this robe. This weekend, he will graduate from Howard University Law
School.
He remembers the shaky foundation of his young life. A mother who could not take care of him. He lived in six foster homes in ten
years.
"Moving to these different homes. The kids were like 'you weren't here yesterday.' Where's your mom at'?" said Freeman.
At 18 years old, he left the system and went to college in search of room and board. He knew what people expected of kids in the foster
care system - not much.
"All I would hear is that they were in jail or homeless or weren't doing too well," said Freeman.
He beat the odds and graduated, but he felt ... alone.
"I can distinctly remember walking across the stage in undergrad. You know at graduation everyone has their cheer section that yells as
you walk across the stage and there was almost silence as I walked across," said Freeman.
It will be different this time. When Freeman gets, his diploma Saturday at the convention center, there will be 26 people - friends and
supporters from as far away as California - in D.C. to show their support.
Freeman also got a boost from an internship program for kids who have spent time in foster care. He was placed in the office
of then Senator Hillary Clinton. Clinton even mentions him in the updated version of her book "It Takes A Village."

Now, he may use his law degree to work on public policy - especially children's issues. He wants all kids to know: "There's a bright
future out there for you if you stay focused and work hard."
And to the adults who hear his story, Freeman said help a child. He is living proof of the difference it can make.

On eve of Mother's Day, Clinton pushes for paid leave for new parents From CNN Senior State Department Producer
Elise Labott WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pledged to push Congress to get paid leave for
federal employees who are parents of newborn or newly adopted children on Friday, in a videotaped Mother's. Day
message to State Department employees."I know how challenging it can be to balance the demands of work and
family," Clinton said. "Whether you're welcoming a new baby, juggling soccer practice and piano lessons, or even
helping plan your daughter's wedding --parenting can be more than a full-time job."Clinton's daughter, Chelsea, is
getting married this summer. Currently, federal employees do not get paid maternity or paternity leave. Clinton said she
would work with Congress to take "overdue" steps to provide State Department families with the paid time off they
need to recuperate from childbirth, care for the mother, care for a newborn With a serious ailment or disability, or
complete an adoption."We can and should do more to provide public servants with the same maternity and paternity
leave benefits that many private sector employers already offer," Clinton said. "They're standard for many other
governments around the world. It's not enough to just talk about the importance of family-- our policies must reflect our
commitment and our values."Clinton has been at the forefront of the Obama administration in pushing for better
benefits for federal employees. She was the administration's first cabinet secretary to ask for benefits for same-sex
partners of federal employees, requesting the extension for Foreign Service employees. President Obama has since
extended some benefits to same-sex partners of employees throughout the federal government.

Dear Rubens and Antonio:
I just wanted to personally congratulate you on behalf of Brazil for being the first donor to sign on and contribute to the
Haiti Reconstruction Fund.
I am sorry I was in Haiti yesterday and could not attend the signing ceremony.
Brazil's $55 million contribution is truly impressive! To my knowledge, there is no precedent for any other emerging
donor contributing at this !evert° a multilateral post-disaster or post-conflict trust fund.
I hope your example encourages other donors to follow suit.
Thank you again for all you are doing for Haiti.
Best.

Hi Cheryl,
The U.S.-China dialogue on Latin American issues began in 2006 during the Bush administration, led by Tom Shannon,
and recurred in 2007 and 2008. My trip to China will be the first such dialogue to take place during the Obama
administration
China is
now a top-three trading partner of many Latin American countries and is in fact the number one trading partner of Brazil,
as well as being a donor member of the Inter-American Development Bank and observer at the Organization of American
States.
The purpose of these talks is three-fold: to inform the Chinese of our policy priorities in the Americas, to learn about their
views on the region, and to explore potential areas of cooperation in the areas of economic and social development. In
addition to the formal meetings with government officials, I will also be meeting with Latin American diplomats, Chinese
academics and private sector groupings.
Our dialogue with China on Latin America is one of three sub-dialogues that are part of the broader U.S.-China strategic
framework to ensure that the bilateral relationship is positive, cooperative, and comprehensive. The others are the China-
Africa talks that AF hosted in Washington last month and the dialogue on South and Central Asia.
Best, Arturo

American VIP humiliated at airport
Prof. Donna Shalala, Clinton's secretarrof health, arrives in Israel in order to fight academic
boycott against Israel, claims she was held at Ben-Gurion Airport just because she has Arab
last name
Itamar Eichner
This is not how she imagined her visit to Israel. Prof. Donna Shalala, who served as the US Secretary
of Health and Human Services for eight years under Clinton and is currently the president of the
University of Miami, was held for two-and-a-half hours at Ben Gurion Airport during which she
underwent a humiliating security debriefing because of her Arab last name — all this despite the fact
that her hosts notified the airport ahead of time that she is a VIP.
The fact that Shalala arrived in Israel as part of an official delegation of the heads of universities
fighting against the academic boycott against the Jewish State also seemed not to help her.
Shalala, 69, was born in the US to Lebanese immigrant parents. She is considered a true friend of
Israel and has visited the country many times in the past.
She recently arrived in Israel as a guest of the American Jewish Congress with the objective of
increasing collaboration among universities in Israel, the US, and the Palestinian Authority. During
their visit, members of the delegation met with President Shimon Peres, Deputy Foreign Minister Danny
Ayalon, and Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad.

The official visit ended on July 12, but Shalala stayed on for another two days for a private visit.
The AJC claims that it notified the Israel Airports Authority of Shalala's VIP status as is customary
prior to her departure. However, the IAA claims that it has no record on file for Shalala prior to her
arrival.
When Shalala arrived at the airport, she was not recognized as a VIP and was even afforded what
she claims to be "special" treatment because of her Arab last name. She claims she was held for two-
and-a-half hours during which she was asked invasive and humiliating personal questions. Despite
the delay, she managed to board the flight to the US. Officials who spoke with her said she was
deeply offended by the treatment she received.
An IAA spokesperson reported in response: "This incident is unknown to us. We performed a
thorough check. There was no contact made with us or any other body. No unusual events were
registered at Ben Gurion Airport, and we have no idea about this incident, which, from our
perspective, never happened."
IAA officials said that root of the problem is that the host organizations don't bother accompanying
their guests to the airport.
The incident was raised Wednesday during a discussion convened by Deputy Foreign Ministry
Ayalon to discuss treatment of VIPs at Ben Gurion Airport. During the discussion, it was agreed that a
new protocol will be drafted that will keep incidents to a minimum.
Shalala preferred not to comment on the article.

Dear Cheryl:
Jean-Louis and I had a lengthy conversation today covering a broad range of subjects relating to your interest in
supporting textile and apparel activity in Haiti. He has subsequently shared with me a number of specific
materials on the Haiti project, including an email of yours which highlights the objectives of the project and a
suggested timeline, as well as the business proposal made by Hansoll. When I digest these latter materials, I
will consider myself in a much better position to make responsive recommendations to you.
As I communicated to Jean-Louis, I am happy to be helpful to you and the State Department on this project. I
can make myself available a couple of days a month for meetings and pretty much on an as needed basis for
phone conversations. I retain my affiliation with Warburg Pincus, the global private equity firm. This requires
my presence in New York (generally) a couple of days a week. As I think you know, I am also Chairman of the
Board of Campbell Soup Company. This entails three or four days a month.
Fortunately, I am not really "retired." This means that I have some flexibility in how I spend my time. You
should feel free to call on me.
I retain my interest in and connections with the retail and apparel industry. While I am far from an expert on
sourcing and production of apparel and textiles, I have some relevant experience and many friends who will do
their best to keep me from looking foolish.

Fibi Netanyahu
In 2001, PM boasted of manipulating Oslo accords
BY LIEL LEIBOVITZ I Jul 15, 2010 4:03 PM I
Meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu last week, President Obama could not have been more effusive. "I believe Prime
Minister Netanyahu wants peace," Obama said. "I believe he is ready to take risks for peace."
A newly revealed tape of Netanyahu in 2001, being interviewed while he thinks the cameras are off, shows him in a
radically different light. In it, Netanyahu dismisses American foreign policy as easy to maneuver, boasts of having
derailed the Oslo accords with political trickery, and suggests that the only way to deal with the Palestinians is to
"beat them up, not once but repeatedly, beat them up so it hurts so badly, until it's unbearable" (all translations are
mine).
According to Haaretz's Gideon Levy, the video should be "Banned for viewing by children so as not to corrupt them,
and distributed around the country and the world so that everyone will know who leads the government of Israel."
Netanyahu is speaking to a small group of terror victims in the West Bank settlement of Ofra two years after
stepping down as prime minister in 1999. He appears laid-back. After claiming that the only way to deal with the
Palestinian Authority was a large-scale attack, Netanyahu was asked by one of the participants whether or not the
United States would let such an attack come to fruition.
"I know what America is," Netanyahu replied. "America is a thing you can move very easily, move it in the right
direction. They won't get in their way." He then called former president Bill Clinton "radically pro-Palestinian," and
went on to belittle the Oslo peace accords as vulnerable to manipulation. Since the accords state that Israel would

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770481 Date: 08/31/2015
be allowed to hang on to pre-defined military zones in the West Bank, Netanyahu told his hosts that he could
torpedo the accords by defining vast swaths of land as just that.
"They asked me before the election if I'd honor [the Oslo accords]," Netanyahu said. "I said I would, but ... I'm going
to interpret the accords in such a way that would allow me to put an end to this galloping forward to the '67 borders.
How did we do it? Nobody said what defined military zones were. Defined military zones are security zones; as far
as I'm concerned, the entire Jordan Valley is a defined military zone. Go argue."
Smiling, Netanyahu then recalled how he forced former U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to agree to let
Israel alone determine which parts of the West Bank were to be defined as military zones. "They didn't want to give
me that letter," Netanyahu said, "so I didn't give them the Hebron agreement [the agreement giving Hebron back to
the Palestinians]. I cut the cabinet meeting short and said, 'I'm not signing.' Only when the letter came, during that
meeting, to me and to Arafat, did I ratify the Hebron agreement. Why is this important? Because from that moment
on, I de facto put an end to the Oslo accords."
President Obama, and anyone else concerned about Israel's commitment to the peace process, may watch the tape
online here.

Angst about USAID's fate grows as development reviews stall
Posted: 15 Jul 2010 06:30 AM PDT
The development community is up in arms about the persistent delays in the administration's two major reviews ol
development policy, as internal disagreements continue to plague the ongoing efforts to reconcile America's
development and foreign-policy goals.
The administration's two major development reviews, the White House's Presidential Study Directive on Global
Development (PSD-7) and the State Department's Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) are
both missing in action as the administration crosses the 18-month mark. The interim report of the QDDR was
never released and there's concern the final document might not be ready by the stated September deadline.
The PSD, a draft version of whichwas first published on The Cable, is being held up by a continuing and
mounting disagreement between the White House and the State Department over how to divide power over
development between Foggy Bottom and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).
According to administration sources and development-community leaders, the dispute between the National
Security Council and the office of the Secretary of State Hillary Clinton came to a head at a principals' meeting in
late June, when a near-final version of the PSD was discussed. Clinton, our sources report, refused to sign off on th
PSD because she disagreed with that document's determination that USAID should be the lead agency in charge of
individual development missions in the field.
Multiple issues are still in dispute between State and the NSC concerning the reviews, including the role of USAID
Administrator Rajiv Shah and what level of autonomy USAID will be granted in determining its own policies,
budgets, and priorities. Shah has been rebuilding USAID's intellectual capacity, but the aid community fears th;
Clinton intends to consolidate real power inside her office despite her promise to "elevate" and "integrate"
development as the third pillar of national security alongside diplomacy and defense.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770482 Date: 08/31/2015
Many believe that the White House launched a not-so-subtle salvo at Clinton by releasing a statement on
development at the G-8, just days after the contentious principals' meeting, that closely tracks what's known about
the PSD and declaring it as U.S. policy before the internal negotiations with State were completed.
Leading development community-voices are now openly venting their frustration with the delays in the process.
"Eighteen months into the administration, the federal government remains abysmally organized to address Haiti,
Pakistan and other development challenges," wrote Nancy Birdsall, the president of the Center for Global
Development, on the organization's website Thursday. "When it comes to global development, I'd give
President Obama and his top advisors an A for strategic vision and a big fat F for failure to get on with it."
In an open letter to Clinton, National Security Advisor Jim Jones, and National Economic Council chairman
Larry Summers, Birdsall raised several issues that resonate with development advocates. She called the
Millennium Challenge Corporation "pathetically underfunded,"lamented that no one seems to know who's in
charge of big initiatives on food security and global health, and complained that USAID still has vacancies for
several senior staff positions.
Birdsall's calls for giving USAID total independence and cabinet-level status aren't likely to be final
recommendations from either the White House or the State Department.
But her overall anxiety about USAID's status is widely shared in the development community. A team of top
development leaders including former USAID administrator Brian Atwood wrote todayto protest the cuts in
the foreign aid budgetthat Congress is calling for.
"We are grateful for the emphasis the President has placed on development and foreign assistance -- a tradition he
continues from President Bush. And we strongly support Secretary Clinton's call to make USAID 'the premier
development agency in the world,' they wrote. "But this goal will only be achieved when USAID's personnel capacit
is rebuilt and its funding enhanced."
World Food Prize Laureate Rev. David Beckmann, who co-chairs the Modernizing Foreign Assistance Network
(MFAN), told The Cable, "The Obama administration is doing smart and creative things to help hungry and poor
people around the world. But they are hung up by organizational confusion, and the president needs to make it cle
that USAID, not the State Department, has lead responsibility for development."
MFAN even has a running counter on its website tracking the days since President Obama pledged to release hi;
overall development policy.
Adding to the concern is the fact that two of the lead officials who are in charge of the QDDR will be departing the
State Department soon. Deputy Secretary of State Jack Lew has been tapped to become the next director of the
White House's Office of Management and Budget. Policy Planning chief Anne Marie Slaughterhas made it
known that her two-year leave from Princeton will require her to return to New Jersey at the end of the year.
State Department officials assure The Cable that the QDDR will be completed before Lew and Slaughter leave Fogg
Bottom. Nevertheless, the delays are having an own effect of their own, said Birdsall.
"Time is not on our side," she told The Cable in an interview. "We're missing in action as a country."

AFTER IROQUOIS LACROSSE TEAM DENIED ENTRY TO UK, GELLIBRAND ASKS
SECRETARY OF STATE TO DEVELOP INTERNATIONALLY-RECOGNIZED TRAVEL
DOCUMENTS FOR TRIBES AND NATIONS IN NORTH AMERICA
Gillibrand: "We Must Ensure that Native Americans Have the Same Freedom to Travel Around the World"
Washington, DC — With the Iroquois Nationals Lacrosse Team missing their first world championship game in
England due to the British government's refusal to recognize their Haudenosaunee Confederacy-issued
passports, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) today asked Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to work with
Native American leaders and the Canadian and UK governments to develop internationally-recognized travel
documents for the Iroquois nation as well as other tribes and nations in North America in order to prevent any
Native American groups from being denied travel abroad in the future. Senator Gillibrand praised Secretary
Clinton for clearing the way for the 23-member team to travel to the United Kingdom to participate in the
Olympics of lacrosse and expressed disappointment in the outcome.
In a letter to Secretary Clinton, Senator Gillibrand wrote, "Considering the recent situation which prevented the
members of the Iroquois Nationals Lacrosse team and their supporters from traveling to the United Kingdom to
participate in the international lacrosse tournament with the Haudenosaunee passports, and in an effort to
prevent against such disappointment in the future, I therefore request that you work with Tribal governments, in
concert with the Canadian government to the extent that Canada faces a similar situation, to come to an
understanding with the United Kingdom and other foreign governments with the goal of establishing a
document or process that would provide Native American travelers with the same freedom of movement
enjoyed by all U.S. citizens."
The members of the Iroquois lacrosse team view their tribe as a sovereign nation and, like many Native
Americans throughout New York, strongly and rightfully protect their own national identities and will not
accept a U.S. or Canadian passport. This important recognition coupled with heightened aviation security
standards after September 11th pose a challenge for the Iroquois lacrosse team, leaving them unable to leave
New York and compete in England. To ensure that this does not happen again, Senator Gillibrand encouraged
the U.S. and Canada to work with Native American leaders to develop a universally recognized document for
all tribes and nations in North America that meet international travel standards.
Current standards for travel documents, developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization for Machine
Readable Passports (MRPs), include a machine readable zone on the identity page with the name, passport
number, nationality, date of birth, sex, passport expiration date and personal identity number of the passport holder.
On Wednesday, Secretary Clinton issued a one-time travel waiver and granted approval for them to re-enter the
U.S., but the British government decided not to recognize the waiver and denied the team entry into the United
Kingdom. The Iroquois lacrosse team defaulted on the first game and currently remains in New York ahead of
tomorrow's second game.
Full text of the letter is below.
Dear Madam Secretary,
Jam writing to you with regard to the Iroquois Nationals Lacrosse Team's recent inability to travel to the
United Kingdom on Haudenosaunee passports. Thank you for your decision to allow a one-time waiver for the
team to travel on their passports and for the efforts of your staff to work with the British consulate on behalf of
the team's ability to travel. Jam disappointed by the decision of the United Kingdom government to deny entry
visas to the team despite your decision to grant them a waiver and assurance that they would be allowed to re-
enter the United States, but am also hopeful that you will continue your efforts to facilitate travel of Native
Americans internationally.

As you are aware, there is a large constituency of Native Americans in New York State. The tribes strongly
guard their sovereignty and rightly celebrate and protect their own national identities. Treaties between the
United States and tribal governments have established their status as sovereign nations within the United
States. It is understandable that they should seek to maintain their national insignia to the greatest extent
possible. Although current law provides that "a person born in the United States to a member of an Indian,
Eskimo, Aleutian, or other aboriginal tribe" ... "shall be nationals and citizens of the United States," we should
also not fail to recognize the unique status that Native Americans enjoy.
In past instances, members of the Iroquois Confederacy have been allowed to travel internationally using a
Haudenosaunee travel document. I fully understand that it is the right of each country to determine what is
accepted as a valid travel document for entry into their country. However, it seems to me that other countries
should be more amenable to consideration of United States Government's policies that accommodate the
sovereignty of Native Americans while addressing the concerns of foreign governments.
It is my understanding that the Haudenosaunee Grand Council of Chiefs is in ongoing discussion with the
Department of State regarding how to improve their passport so that it would meet the higher-level
international travel security requirements. Considering the recent situation which prevented the members of
the Iroquois Nationals Lacrosse team and their supporters from traveling to the United Kingdom to participate
in the international lacrosse tournament with the Haudenosaunee passports, and in an effort to prevent against
such disappointment in the future, I therefore request that you work with Tribal governments, in concert with
the Canadian government to the extent that Canada faces a similar situation, to come to an understanding with
the United Kingdom and other foreign governments with the goal of establishing a document or process that
would provide Native American travelers with the same freedom of movement enjoyed by all US. citizens.
I request your assessment of whether current law would allow the development of an alternative travel
document that would be recognized by other governments such as the United Kingdom, your facilitation of
enhancing the Haudenosaunee passport so that it complies with standard international practices, or if
necessary, the determination of whether legislation would be necessary in order to move forward on resolving
this issue.
Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to working with you to address these concerns.

AFTER IROQUOIS LACROSSE TEAM DENIED ENTRY TO UK, GILLIBRAND ASKS SECRETARY OF STATE TO DEVELOP
INTERNATIONALLY-RECOGNIZED TRAVEL DOCUMENTS FOR TRIBES AND NATIONS IN NORTH AMERICA
Gillibrand: "We Must Ensure that Native Americans Have the Same Freedom to Travel Around the World"
Washington, DC— With the Iroquois Nationals Lacrosse Team missing their first world championship game in England
due to the British government's refusal to recognize their Haudenosaunee Confederacy-issued passports, U.S. Senator

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770491 Date: 08/31/2015
Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) today asked Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to work with Native American leaders and the
Canadian and UK governments to develop internationally-recognized travel documents for the Iroquois nation as well as
other tribes and nations in North America in order to prevent any Native American groups from being denied travel
abroad in the future. Senator Gillibrand praised Secretary Clinton for clearing the way for the 23-member team to travel
to the United Kingdom to participate in the Olympics of lacrosse and expressed disappointment in the outcome.
In a letter to Secretary Clinton, Senator Gillibrand wrote, "Considering the recent situation which prevented the
members of the Iroquois Nationals Lacrosse team and their supporters from traveling to the United Kingdom to
participate in the international lacrosse tournament with the Haudenosaunee passports, and in an effort to prevent
against such disappointment in the future, I therefore request that you work with Tribal governments, in concert with
the Canadian government to the extent that Canada faces a similar situation, to come to an understanding with the
United Kingdom and other foreign governments with the goal of establishing a document or process that would provide
Native American travelers with the same freedom of movement enjoyed by all U.S. citizens."
The members of the Iroquois lacrosse team view their tribe as a sovereign nation and, like many Native Americans
throughout New York, strongly and rightfully protect their own national identities and will not accept a U.S. or Canadian
passport. This important recognition coupled with heightened aviation security standards after September 11th pose a
challenge for the Iroquois lacrosse team, leaving them unable to leave New York and compete in England. To ensure that
this does not happen again, Senator Gillibrand encouraged the U.S. and Canada to work with Native American leaders to
develop a universally recognized document for all tribes and nations in North America that meet international travel
standards.
Current standards for travel documents, developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization for Machine
Readable Passports (MRPs), include a machine readable zone on the identity page with the name, passport number,
nationality, date of birth, sex, passport expiration date and personal identity number of the passport holder.
On Wednesday, Secretary Clinton issued a one-time travel waiver and granted approval for them to re-enter the U.S.,
but the British government decided not to recognize the waiver and denied the team entry into the United Kingdom.
The Iroquois lacrosse team defaulted on the first game and currently remains in New York ahead of tomorrow's second
game.
Full text of the letter is below.
Dear Madam Secretary,
I am writing to you with regard to the Iroquois Nationals Lacrosse Team's recent inability to travel to the United
Kingdom on Haudenosaunee passports. Thank you for your decision to allow a one-time waiver for the team to travel
on their passports and for the efforts of your staff to work with the British consulate on behalf of the team's ability to
travel. I am disappointed by the decision of the United Kingdom government to deny entry visas to the team despite
your decision to grant them a waiver and assurance that they would be allowed to re-enter the United States, but am
also hopeful that you will continue your efforts to facilitate travel of Native Americans internationally.

As you are aware, there is a large constituency of Native Americans in New York State. The tribes strongly guard their
sovereignty and rightly celebrate and protect their own national identities. Treaties between the United States and
tribal governments have established their status as sovereign nations within the United States. It is understandable that
they should seek to maintain their national insignia to the greatest extent possible. Although current law provides that
"a person born in the United States to a member of an Indian, Eskimo, Aleutian, or other aboriginal tribe"..."shall be

State Department is taking right steps to foster Internet freedom
Wednesday, July 21, 2010; Al8
BILLIONS OF people live in countries where the Internet is not free. Confined behind the elaborate firewalls of
authoritarian regimes such as China and Iran, they find their rights to expression threatened online and off-- by
elaborate systems of monitoring and censorship and by harsh laws that punish bloggers with imprisonment or
even death.
In January, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke powerfully in support of Internet freedom, saying,
"We stand for a single Internet where all of humanity has equal access to knowledge and ideas. And we
recognize that the world's information infrastructure will become what we and others make of it."
Since then, the State Department has brought the issue of online freedom to the table in its diplomacy around
the world and joined with Internet providers and social media companies to foster public-private partnership in
Internet freedom. Such collaboration is key, since authoritarian regimes so often contract out the daily work of
censorship to private companies.
Congress, too, has showed commitment to openness online, allocating $35 million in funding between the 2009
and 2010 budgets for work that promotes Internet freedom. This money has yet to be spent, but the State
Department finally has sent the names of designated recipients of the 2009 budget's $5 million in Internet
freedom funding to Congress for its approval and soon will begin the process for distributing this year's grants.
As it moves forward on this vital issue, the State Department must carefully determine how best to spend its
limited resources. Yes, there is no silver bullet to guarantee freedom on the Internet. But it is possible to do

great good with available funds. Investing in censorship-circumvention techniques like those that powered
Tehran's "Twitter revolution" in June 2009 could have a tremendous, measurable impact.
Although this solution is not without its problems -- the best-known provider of this software is the Falun Gong-
affiliated Global Internet Freedom consortium, and users behind China's Great Firewall may mistrust the
technology of a group their government has banned -- the State Department must seriously consider channeling
funds to organizations that have demonstrated great potential to make a difference.
The State Department is attempting a more holistic approach to Internet freedom, spreading funds across a
variety of projects. Monitoring the efficacy of chosen solutions and rewarding those that produce results will be
essential as this program continues.
A cyberspace without walls or barriers, where people can assemble and express themselves freely, without fear
of censorship or imprisonment, will make the world safer for the United States and for democracies everywhere.
Continued public-private partnership, prioritization of Internet freedom in diplomacy and the wise deployment
of allocated funds will move this ideal closer to reality.

All
The Post wrote a good editorial today on our Internet freedom work (see below). It's a far cry from what the editorial
board had to say in November (here) and is the product of a lot of hard work from several bureaus and offices in the
Department to drive Internet freedom as a policy priority. EEB and DRL will convene a meeting of the NetFreedom
Taskforce next week at the working level to continue to advance Internet freedom within the building and with external
audiences. It is nice to see some success in changing the narrative on this important but challenging issue.

The below by Kouchner is worth reading if you haven't seen it.
The Internet: a critical international policy issue, by Bernard Kouchner (May 10, 2010)
In 2015, three and a half billion people - half of mankind - will have access to the Internet. There has never been
such a revolution in the freedom of communication and the freedom of expression. But how will this new medium
be used? What new distortions and obstacles will the enemies of the Internet come up with?
Modern technology leads to the best and the worst. Extremist, racist and defamatory websites and blogs
disseminate odious opinions in real time. They have made the Internet into a weapon of war and hate. Websites
are attacked and Internet users are recruited through chatrooms for destructive plots. Violent movements are
infiltrating social networks to spread propaganda and false information.
It is very hard for democracies to control them. I do not subscribe to the naive belief that a new technology,
however efficient and powerful it may be, is bound by nature to advance liberty on all fronts.
Yet, all the same, the distortions are the exception rather than the rule. The Internet is above all the most
fantastic means of breaking down the walls and boundaries that close us off from each other. For the oppressed
peoples, who have been deprived of their right to self-expression and the right to choose their own future, the
Internet provides power beyond their wildest hopes. In minutes, news and images recorded on a telephone can
be disseminated worldwide in cyberspace. It is increasingly difficult the hide a public demonstration, an act of
repression or a violation of human rights.
In authoritarian and repressive countries, mobile telephones and the Internet have given rise to public opinion
and civil society. They have also given citizens a critical means of expression, despite all the restrictions.
However, the temptation to repress free expression is always present. The number of countries that censor the
Internet, that monitor web users and punish them for their opinions, is increasing at an alarming rate. The
Internet can be used against citizens. It can be a formidable intelligence-gathering tool to spot potential
dissidents. Some regimes are already acquiring increasingly sophisticated surveillance technology.
If all of those who are attached to human rights and democracy refused to compromise their principles and used
the Internet to defend freedom of expression, this kind of repression would be much more difficult. I am not

talking about absolute freedom that opens the door to all sorts of abuses. Nobody is promoting that. Instead, I'm
talking about real freedom, which is based on the principle of respecting human dignity and human rights.
In the last few years, multilateral institutions, such as the Council of Europe, and non-governmental
organisations, such as Reporters Without Borders, along with thousands of individuals around the world, have
made a strong commitment to these issues. This is proof, if proof were needed, that this issue does not pit the
West against the rest of the world. No fewer than 180 countries meeting for the World Summit on the
Information Society acknowledged that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights applies fully to the Internet,
especially Article 19, which establishes freedom of expression and freedom of opinion. And yet, some fifty
countries fail to live up to their commitments.
For the occasion of World Press Freedom Day, I have brought together experts, NGO leaders, journalists,
business people and intellectuals this week. Their discussions have confirmed my conviction that the path we
want to take is the right one. I think that we should create an international instrument for monitoring the
commitments that governments have made and for calling them to task when they fail to live up to them. I think
we should provide assistance to cyberdissidents, who should get the same support as other victims of political
repression, and of the need to show our solidarity with them publicly, in close collaboration with the NGOs
working on these issues. I think that we should also discuss the wisdom of adopting a code of conduct regarding
the export of technologies for censoring the Internet and tracking web users.
These issues, along with others, such as the protection of personal data on the Internet and the right of digital
amnesty for everyone promoted by my colleague Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, should be addressed within a
framework that brings together government, civil society and international experts.
Another project is close to my heart. It will be a long and difficult task to implement it, but it is critical. It is to
give the Internet a legal status that reflects its universality. One that recognizes it as an international space, so
that it will be more difficult for repressive governments to use the sovereignty argument against fundamental
freedoms.
This is a critical issue. I think that the battle of ideas has started with, on one side, the advocates of a universal
and open Internet, based on freedom of expression and freedom of association, on tolerance and respect for
privacy and, on the other side, those who want to transform the Internet into a multitude of spaces that are
closed off from each other to serve the purposes of a regime, propaganda and all forms of fanaticism.
Freedom of expression is"the foundation of all other freedoms". Without it, there are no'free nations",
Voltaire said. This spirit of the Enlightenment, which is universal, should run through the new media. The
defence of fundamental freedoms and human rights must be the priority for governance of the Internet. It is
everyone's business.

I heard a wonderful story last night praising Hillary Clinton for her work on behalf of children.
Last night I met Don Graves, he runs the Independent Living Skills Program (ILSP) in Contra Costa
County. The program helps children in the foster care system, and among other things, teaches them
skills needed to live on their own as adults.
Don told a heart-warming story of how then First Lady Hillary Clinton came out to visit with the kids in the
program and hear their concerns. A major concern was that resources for kids coming out of foster care
ended at age 18 and 6 months -- they needed more help. Within two years of the visit, President Clinton
signed the Foster Care Independence Act, providing more money and more resources for ages 18 - 21. I
think it is widely accepted that Hillary championed this legislation, and this was surely echoed by Don. He
was beaming with admiration for her and what she accomplished to help the kids.
He went on to say that one of the participants in the program, Alfred Perez, who was part of the original
discussion with the First Lady, was invited to the White House to see the bill signed. Alfred Perez later
served on the Pew Commission on Foster care and is now teaching at the University of
Chicago. http://www.ssa.uchicaoo.edu/facultv/ptlect/Derez-a.shtml

The Gates-Clinton axis
By: Ben Smith and Jen DiMascio and Laura Rozen
May 24, 2010 04:50 AM EDT
The White House likes to release images of President Barack Obama at the head of the
long Situation Room conference table, sober and experienced advisers lining either side.
But there is another meeting – with no cameras and no Obama – where the Cabinet's two
most formidable figures seek to put their own stamp on the administration's national
security agenda. It is the conversation Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Secretary
of State Hillary Clinton try to have each week when they're both in Washington, often in
the company of National Security Adviser Jim Jones.
In an administration dominated by a powerful White House staff, Clinton and Gates have
emerged as the giant exception and the only important center of gravity outside 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue.
Their close relationship has been central to the unusual degree of agreement on critical
issues, most notably the Afghan surge but also a range of other initiatives, from increasing
the size of the State Department's foreign aid budget to imposing new sanctions on Iran.
"It's a phalanx," former Pentagon official Leslie Gelb said of the Clinton-Gates alliance. "I
can't remember a really important issue where they have disagreed. They are both center-
right; they have their four feet firmly planted on that ground. And that is, they are not going
to open themselves up to serious attack from the right, whether it's Iraq or Afghanistan or
Iran or you name it."
Gates, known inside the White House as "Yoda," is unquestionably the most powerful
member of the Obama Cabinet — the only one with the muscle to push back. Clinton,
meanwhile, is the most popular, her approval ratings cruising well above Obama's own.
An alliance is good for each of them.
Clinton saves Gates from political isolation as a Republican in a Democratic administration

and has signed on to a policy agenda he has set, adding her voice to his demands for
more troops and her department's civilian resources to the war in Afghanistan.
Gates, for his part, has saved Clinton from a different kind of marginalization by a powerful
White House staff, which has a sometimes-rocky relationship with her own staff of
loyalists, a residue of thebitter 2008 campaign. He's offered her a potent back channel to
power and — some of her most political allies have told other Democrats — a path
forward inside the administration.
Gates, who has long signaled an eagerness to retire, just launched what appears to be his
final initiative, a tough push to scale back the Pentagon's gargantuan bureaucracy.
Clinton, with her hawkish image and ties to Gates and to military brass, would be his most
logical successor — and some of her most senior allies have begun quietly to float the
notion.
The two meet regularly, though talk of weekly lunches was disrupted by the aggressive
travel schedules both keep. They most recently lunched together April 26 at the State
Department, a source said, but meet almost weekly, along with Jones, at the White
House. The two are said to be personally compatible. Both, one source noted, are
Midwestern United Methodists.
Connecticut Rep. John Larson, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said Gates
and Clinton have briefed the caucus three times together and present a united front. "The
overlap and the ease which they transition from point to point — very notable," he said.
"We have all Cabinet members move through the caucus. It's not always so notable that
they transition from point to point, seamlessly and are on the same page."
Such a close alliance between the two leading members of a modern president's Cabinet
is hardly typical.
"A lot of presidents have had to spend quite a bit of time adjudicating disputes between
the Pentagon and Foggy Bottom," said Strobe Talbott, a State Department official under
President Bill Clinton.
More often, they're fighting their own wars. Some of the deepest intramural hatreds in
American government have run across the Potomac, a tradition embodied most recently
by Donald Rumsfeld and Colin Powell, secretaries of defense and state in the
administration of President George W. Bush, who famously did not get along.
"My sense is that each of them understands the way in which the other one's function can
help advance the cause," said Talbott. "Bob Gates totally understands the need for a very
proactive and well-funded development policy in order to keep weak states from becoming
failed states."
The relationship is, indeed, part of a pattern for Gates, one that's made him one of the
most successful and enduring government officials of the past half-century. A career CIA
analyst who served as deputy national security adviser under Brent Scowcroft in the
George H.W. Bush White House before becoming the first career officer to lead the spy
agency, Gates spent 13 years in academia before being named Rumsfeld's successor in
2006.

Still, those who know Gates worried that after Obama made the, surprise decision to keep
him on at the Pentagon, he would inevitably be an outlier in a Democratic administration.
But the quick bond he formed with Hillary Clinton and others were part of a familiar
strategy.
"He's by nature an alliance builder," said a senior official from the Bush and Clinton
administrations.
Gates did not have a relationship with George W. Bush either when he took over from
Rumsfeld in 2006. But he had worked with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and
Stephen Hadley, Rice's successor as national security adviser during Bush's
administration. That helped him get along in the Cabinet, and he didn't stop there.
In contrast to Rumsfeld, who was dismissive of Capitol Hill, Gates courted key members
of Congress, particularly Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), the chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee. After Levin brought up concerns about confirming Marine Gen. Peter
Pace for a second two-year term as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gates pulled
back on the nomination.
He has followed that pattern in the Obama administration. When Jones was taking knocks
in the press for being less powerful than his top deputies, Gates called on Washington
Post columnist David Ignatius, to defend Jones — a fellow supporter of the military and
someone in his age bracket — as "the glue that holds this team together," a dexterous bit
of politics that allowed him to do Jones a favor while simultaneous capitalizing on what's
perceived as his bureaucratic weakness.
Some of Gates's admirers see the relationship with Hillary Clinton in a similar light and
argue that he's been able to use her to achieve his policy goals — and not vice versa.
"The reality is that no one, including the White House, is willing to cross Gates because
we desperately need him for political cover on everything, whether it be defense budget
reform, arms control or[Afghanistan and Pakistan] and Iraq," a Democratic foreign policy
official said, challenging a reporter to "name me one issue where [Clinton] had a strong
viewpoint and then successfully maneuvered the administration in her direction."
Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell dismissed the notion that Gates has used Clinton to
his advantage as "complete nonsense."
"Is this a mutually beneficial relationship? Sure, everyone benefits when the secretaries of
state and defense have a good working relationship. Are they using each other to advance
personal agendas? Absolutely not," he said. "They happen to be very like-minded on
many issues. She is, as he often says, very lough-minded' — and he respects that about
her. I know it's not very juicy, but there's no secret alliance here. The fact is they simply
see eye to eye more often than not."
Clinton, too, has experience in navigating the highest levels and of building unlikely
alliances.
"This replicates one of her most effective moves in the Senate, which was to figure out
who the power brokers were, study up on them and make sure she could work effectively
with them," said Heather Hurlburt, executive director of the National Security Network, a

Democratic group.
And if Gates has been a behind-the-scenes architect of policy, Clinton's role is more
public: She is "one of the articulators of the overall strategy that we adopted" on Iran and
China, Jones recently told Newsweek.
Some critics of Obama's policy, though, see the two hawks as having pulled the president
to the right. The two were particularly instrumental in making the case internally for an
Afghan troop surge, and they were close enough to sell it jointly, appearing together on
television to defend the plan.
Just last week, Clinton and Gates testified before the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee to validate the administration's commitment to modernize the nation's nuclear
arsenal, and to preserve the ability to design new warhead components if needed.
The administration's stance was a victory for Gates, as the Pentagon appears to have
fought hard to keep the nuclear capacity — reportedly over the objections of other
members of the administration's inner circle, including Vice President Joe Biden.
Ironically, close observers say, the chief diplomat has emerged, if anything, as blunter and
more hawkish than the diplomatic secretary of defense. After an attempted bombing in
New York's Times Square appeared to have links to the Pakistani Taliban, Clinton publicly
warned of "very severe consequences" should an attack be traced back to Pakistan.
Gates took a far milder line.
"It's their country," he said. "They remain in the driver's seat, and they have their foot on
the accelerator." I

WASHINGTON — U.S. Senator Robert Menendez (D-NJ), who will chair a Foreign Relations Committee hearing on the
release of the Pan Am Flight 103 bomber, today was joined by Senators Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-
NY) and Charles Schumer (D-NY) in announcing a new plan to gather critical information on the issue. Because the key
Scottish government, British government and BP witnesses declined to testify at the hearing scheduled for Thursday,
Menendez and his colleagues announced that the hearing date will be re-set and that they will work with the Foreign
Relations Committee to launch an investigation into the matter and provide the basis for the re-scheduled hearing.
Senator Menendez explained the new plan: "We are at a place where no witness of consequence has the courage to
step forward and clear the air — they would prefer to sweep this under the rug. Because of this stonewalling, we
are shifting our efforts to a longer-term, multi-dimensional inquiry into the release of al-Megrahi. The hearing will
be postponed and rescheduled, and it will be coupled with an investigation into al-Megrahi's release. In declining
our witness request, the Scottish government did offer to provide answers to further questions we may have. We
appreciate that, and will take them up on that offer. We will work with the Foreign Relations Committee to launch
the investigation into this matter — asking the pointed questions that we would have in person, and requesting
additional documents. Our requests will be frequent and public — we don't intend for this issue to be forgotten or
swept under the rug. When our information is more complete, we will release it publicly, hold the hearing and
discuss what we have found."
Senator Lautenberg said: "I will not rest until there is a clear and credible record of what led to the early release of
the Lockerbie bomber. In the last year, troubling questions surrounding the circumstances of al-Megrahi's
release have come to the surface. The families of the victims of Pan Am 103 have already suffered so much, and
the release of this convicted terrorist has only amplified their anguish and grief. For their sake, we must get to
the bottom of these questions. Those who commit vicious acts of terrorism have to know that they will be
punished without compassion, and a rigorous investigation will help send that message."
Senator Gillibrand said: "It has become clear that there is a great deal of information already in the public domain
that has not been fully investigated. Already we have seen an abundance of circumstantial evidence that justice
and the international fight against terror were compromised to serve the interests of BP and possibly other
companies. The only independent review of this matter was done by the Scottish Parliament, which said they
were 'extremely concerned' about the basis on which compassionate release was granted. The Scottish review
was also limited in scope and did not examine the external influences on Al-Megrahi's release. Our investigation
will review past evidence and new information that we intend to gather in a new light, so that we can answer
questions about whether BP tried to free Al-Megrahi. What has happened here is a total miscarriage of
justice. Al-Megrahi should never have been released, and we must answer exactly why this happened."
Senator Schumer said: "It is time for the UK and Scottish Governments to prove they are part of the solution here
and not part of the problem. Day after day, week after week, more and more questions get raised and we need all
parties to this controversy involved in answering them. We will continue in our quest for the truth so that justice
can be served and the families of the victims can have their faith in the legal process restored."
Invited to the hearing, but declining to appear were: Scottish Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill (made the
decision to release al-Megrahi), Dr. Andrew Fraser (Scottish prison system doctor cited by MacAskill as responsible for
the medical prognosis that led to the release), Jack Straw, the former British Justice Secretary (has acknowledged
that his government pushed for al-Megrahi's release as part of a prisoner transfer agreement), BP CEO Tony Hayward
(directly involved in negotiations with Libya), and Sir Mark Allen (former British MI6 hired by BP and acted as a liaison
between the company and the Libyan and British governments).

No word on the new date.
Reason being given to families and others is that lack of cooperation by UK and Scots in providing a

Translated from Ma'ariv
MITCHELL LIKELY TO PAY THE PRICE
Ma 'arty (11/1/2010, p. 6) by Eli Bardenstein -- The US administration intends to replace its
special envoy to the Middle East, George Mitchell, said sources in Washington. A number of
additional top officials are expected to be replaced at the same opportunity.
The reasons for Mitchell's replacement are the failure he and his team have had at renewing
the talks between Israel and the Palestinians, the Administration's desire to bring new blood into
the efforts, and pressures to resume the peace process in the region.
One of the names that has already begun to circulate as a potential successor is the former US
ambassador to Israel, Martin Indyk. Another possible course of action suggested by the blog
"Politico" is to divide Mitchell's job into two: Indyk will deal with the Palestinians, while
Obama's senior aide, Dennis Ross, will deal with the Israelis.
Mitchell's spokesman, Jonathan Prince, has already left his post under unclear circumstances
and has turned to the world of private business. The State Department denied allegations that
Prince left because of criticism that he had aired about Ross maintaining positions that were
closer to the Israeli positions than to those of the White House.
Another top official in Mitchell's team, Mara Rudman, was supposed to have left her post as
the director of Mitchell's staff for a senior position in the State Department, but decided to
remain after she was not given the job.
Reports have repeatedly been received in Jerusalem about mounting tension between Mitchell
and his team, on the one hand, and Dennis Ross, who works directly for the White House, on the
other. The two parties were said to be divided over the way in which it would be possible to
persuade Netanyahu to renew the direct talks. Ross, who served in the past in Mitchell's current
capacity and headed an Israeli research center—the Jewish People Policy Planning Institute—is
believed to have been opposed to the intense pressure that the US administration applied on
Israel, arguing that that pressure would not yield the desired results. Ross believed that the
administration would be better served by "working with the Israelis and understanding them

better," said one source in Jerusalem. An alternate position was maintained by Mitchell and
Rudman, who believed that it would be advisable to pressure Netanyahu. It now appears that
Ross's approach has prevailed, and that the administration is going to replace the people who
guided the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.
As Ma 'any reported, Netanyahu is scheduled to fly to New Orleans next week to attend the
general assembly of the Jewish communities, where he will meet Vice President Joe Biden. From
there, Netanyahu will make a short visit to New York, where he will meet other Jewish leaders
and will give interviews to the American media.
Netanyahu is not going to meet President Obama this time, despite intense efforts that were
made by his office to arrange such a meeting. The reason the two men are not going to meet is
that President Obama is scheduled to leave for long trip to India, Indonesia and South Korea on
the day that Netanyahu arrives. One observer in Washington said: "Obama ran as far away from
Bibi as possible in order to avoid a meeting with him. If he could, Obama would take a space
ship to Mars."
Netanyahu decided to defy protocol and to go to the United States in any event, Obama's
absence notwithstanding.

Can the Dude Abide?
By MAUREEN DOWD
WASHINGTON
Barack Obama became president by brilliantly telling his own story. To stay president, he will need to show he
can understand our story.
At first it was exciting that Obama was the sort of brainy, cultivated Democrat who would be at home in a
"West Wing" episode.
But now he acts like he really thinks he's on "West Wing," gliding through an imaginary, amber-lit set where
his righteous self-regard is bound to be rewarded by the end of the hour.
Hey, dude, you're a politician. Act like one.
As the head of the Democratic Party, the president should have supported the Democratic candidate for
governor in Rhode Island, the one the Democratic Governors Association had already lavished more than $1
million in TV ads on. If Obama was going to refuse to endorse Frank Caprio out of respect for Lincoln Chafee,
the former Republican who endorsed him for president and is now running as an independent, the president
should have at least stayed out of Providence.
Reductio ad absurdum: After two years of taking his base for granted, the former Pied Piper of America's youth
had to spar with Jon Stewart to try to get the attention of young people who once idolized him.
Obama still has the killer smile, but he's more often sniffy than funny. When Stewart called White House
legislation "timid," Obama got defensive and offered a less-than-thrilling new mantra: "Yes, we can but ..."
"We have done things that people don't even know about," said Obama, who left his Great Communicator
mantle back in Grant Park on election night.

In 2008, the message was him. The promise was him. And that's why 2010 is a referendum on him.
With his coalition and governing majority shattering around him, President Obama will have to summon
political skills — starting Wednesday — that he has not yet shown he has.
His arrogance led him to assume: If I build it, they will understand. He can't get the gratitude he feels he
deserves for his achievements if no one knows what he achieved and why those achievements are so vital.
Once it seemed impressive that he was so comfortable in his own skin. Now that comfort comes across as an
unwillingness to be wrong.
We want the best people to govern us, but many voters are so turned off by Obama's superior air that they're
rushing into the arms of disturbingly inferior pols.
Obama admitted to The Times's Peter Baker: "There is probably a perverse pride in my administration — and I
take responsibility for this; this was blowing from the top — that we were going to do the right thing, even if
short term it was unpopular."
But who defines what's "right"?
With the exception of Obama, most Americans seemed to agree that the "right" thing to do until the economy
recovered was to focus on jobs instead of getting the Congress mired for months in making over health
insurance and energy policy. And the "right" thing to do was to come down harder on the big banks for
spending on bonuses instead of lending to small businesses that don't get bailouts.
Many of us thought the "right" thing to do was to ratify the civil rights of gay Americans in marriage and the
military. (A new Pentagon study shows that most U.S. troops and their families don't care if gays are allowed to
serve openly.)
In an interview with progressive bloggers, the president was asked why he was lagging behind Republicans like
Ted Olson on gay marriage.
Noting that he has a lot of friends and staffers in committed gay relationships, Obama conceded only that his
attitude was evolving. "I think it's pretty clear where the trend lines are going," the president said.
Trend lines? Really inspiring, dude.
One top aide told me that the president — who perversely tried to marginalize a once-captivated press corps —
was beginning to realize that he had not used his charm as effectively as he could have.
His inner circle believed too much in the power of the Aura and in protecting the Brand. They didn't think they
needed to sell anything or fight back when the crazies started sliming them. They didn't care that the average
citizen needed an M.B.A. to understand the financial plan and a Ph.D. to fathom what the health care plan
would mean.
Because Obama stayed above it all on health care and delegated to Max Baucus, he missed the moment in
August of 2009 when Sarah Palin and the Tea Party got oxygen with their loopy rants on death panels. It never
occurred to the Icon that such wildness and gullibility would trump lofty rationality.
As the president tries to ride the Tea Party tiger, let's hope for this change: that he puts some audacity in his
audacity.

scheduled to arrive in Haiti later this week.
Large amphibious ships, like Iwo Jima, resemble small aircraft carriers and include the ability to support helicopter and
landing craft operations to quickly move personnel and cargo, making it an ideal platform to support humanitarian-relief
missions on short notice.
A crew of 1,600 military and civilian medical, engineering, aviation, logistical and other support personnel are embarked
aboard Iwo Jima, including U.S. Navy engineers, a contingent of 500 Marines with logistical-support expertise,
volunteers from the U.S. Public Health Service and various non-governmental organizations (NG0s), as well as medical,
dental and engineering professionals from Europe, North America and South America.
Eight CH-46 Sea Knight, medium-lift, dual-rotor helicopters; two MH-60 Knight Hawk helicopters and two amphibious
landing craft units (ICU's) are on Iwo Jima to support the ship's operations.
Iwo Jima is a Wasp-class amphibious ship capable of speeds in excess of
20 knots that can provide robust ship-to-shore, as well as shore-to-shore logistics support during contingencies ranging
from traditional military operations to humanitarian and disaster-relief missions.
Because of the Caribbean region's history of severe-weather events during the peak months of the hurricane season, the
ship has remained in the area throughout its present deployment, ready to support U.S.
disaster relief efforts when directed.
Iwo Jima was in Port-de-Paix, Haiti, from July 24 through Aug. 3. It was the first stop on CP10 and the crew provided
medical assistance to more than 4,000 Haitian citizens, performed 32 surgeries, completed six engineering projects, and
delivered 231 pallets of humanitarian-assistance supplies donated by NG0s.
In September 2008, the amphibious ship USS Kearsarge deployed to Haiti to support U.S. relief efforts after a succession
of storms (Fay, Gustav, Hanna and Ike) devastated the country. Kearsarge provided robust air and sealift support,
delivering 3.3 million pounds of food, water and other aid to communities impacted by the disasters.

Eyes on Hillary Clinton as She Leads Mideast Peace Talks
Opinions Are Split on Whether Secretary of State Has Skills Necessary for Negotiations
By JAKE TAPPER
WASHINGTON, Sept. 2, 2010 —
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton today stepped into the international spotlight, assuming the day-to-day
responsibility of trying to broker a Mideast peace that has eluded her predecessors for decades.
Seated between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the
State Department, Clinton heralded the first direct negotiations between the parties in nearly two years.
Whether both sides can overcome a history of failed negotiations and dashed hopes will depend in large part on
the individual leaders making difficult concessions, Clinton said.
"We cannot and will not impose a solution. Only you can make the decisions necessary to reach an agreement
and secure a peaceful future for the Israeli and Palestinian people," she said.
Clinton appeared to embrace the opportunity and the symbolism of the moment 0 speaking slowly and
authoritatively, embracing her partners on both sides, and reminding the world of the difficulties to be expected
on the road ahead.
"Those who oppose the cause of peace will try in every way possible to sabotage this process, as we have
already seen this week," she said, referring to the killing Tuesday of four Israeli civilians by Hamas.
But "the core issues at the center of these negotiations -- territory, security, Jerusalem, refugees, settlements and
others -- will get no easier if we wait, nor will they resolve themselves."

The talks, which also included Jordan's King Abdullah II and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, represent a
formidable challenge for Clinton, who has spent months coaxing both sides back to the negotiating table.
They also raise the stakes for President Obama, who has set a goal of creating a two-state solution. He met with
Netanyahu and Abbas in private sessions at the White House Wednesday and said he was "cautiously hopeful" a
deal could be reached one year from now.
But experts say success in the months ahead will also depend on Clinton's skill as a diplomat and mediator.
"I think she has credibility. Now whether that translates into diplomatic skills, I don't know," said Shibley
Telhami, the Anwar Sadat professor for peace and development at the University of Maryland. "Frankly, she's
untested as a mediator."
Other observers see Clinton's experience as a politician as an asset because she will be able to not only discuss
the policies but understand the politics of how Palestinian and Israeli leaders "sell" the negotiations to their
peoples at home.
In an ABC News exclusive interview, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Clinton has the best type
of political mind. "[It] knows where you meet the point of principle and knows where you need the subtlety and
the compromise," he said.
1979 Camp David Accords: the Gold Standard
Ahead of the talks, Clinton had requested historical background materials concerning past efforts at peace in the
region, the ultimately unsuccessful one led by her husband, a source close to the secretary of state said.
"She has this relationship with this fellow who has spent some time talking to leaders -- you know President
Clinton -- and she has benefitted from his direct experience," said State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley.
Clinton regards President Jimmy Carter's 1979 Camp David Accords brokered between Israel and Egypt as the
gold standard for negotiations, the Clinton source said.
When then-Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin refused to authorize the dismantling of any Israeli
settlements, Carter's team suggested having the Israeli Parliament make the decision -- and it did. Carter has
credited thinking outside of the box and being innovative as the key.
"You have to be innovative and get a lot of outside help to find some alternative route that might bring you to
the same goals," Carter told interviewer Don Richardson in "Conversations With Carter."
"You really need to look at life or the negotiation as if it were a chessboard. Anticipating what the next move is
and what the next move is after that," said Aaron David Miller, an adviser on the region to six secretaries of
state.
Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who negotiated an end to the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, said that
audaciousness was part of testing the limits.
"The art of statesmanship is to find a position between stagnation and overextension, hopefully at the outer limit
of what is possible," he said during a June 2008 interview on CNN.

Former President Clinton once suggested that willpower also comes in handy. In his autobiography, "My Life,"
he described one very late night at Wye River -- where he conducted his own Mideast peace talks -- where his
"strategy for success had now boiled down to endurance; I was determined to be the last man standing."
What the negotiators are doing when they're not negotiating might also play a role, Carter has said. By holding
peace talks at Camp David, "it was a harmonious environment because Egyptians and Israelis who had been
devoting their adult life to killing each other were required to swim in the same swimming pool, watch the same
movies, play on the same tennis courts, throw horseshoes together, sit on the same rock and talks. That was all
part of it."

Wanted to update you all on the PSA and where things stand. The Ad Council placed the PSA on Wednesday.
Overall, based on the MNR report, our estimated online audience for the PSA launch story was 5.4 million, including
stories on Yahoo Finance, Forbes, and CNN. For just over 24 hours since the MNR distribution, this is fantastic pickup
per the Ad Council.
The Ad Council will continue to push this out domestically and giving us updates on where it is. They are targeting large
sporting events like U.S Open, etc. If you would like the full report with specific stories, I can send separately however
because the file is so large I do not want to max out everyone's inboxes.
On the International side and specifically S interest in placing with Al Jazeera, the Ad Council did a slightly modified
version of the 30 sec PSA, removing the texting information on the final screen and is overnighting the tape to the State
Department today. Once we have that (timing for Tuesday), we will work with Dana and PA to have the PSA placed
accordingly where makes sense.
Larry has already said that local stations in Pakistan liked the ad and were using it/reporting on it. As he is obviously
very busy, hard to know more beyond this point. IIP has been great and the revised ad is going up on America.gov. Will
work them to see what other embassy sites, etc we can promote this with.
We will continue to work to place the ad and will have donation reports on Tuesday that hopefully will reflect monetary
upticks as well. Let me know if you have any questions. Best, Katie

Joining the conversation
BY KATE HEARTFIELD, THE OTTAWA CITIZENAUGUST 19, 2010
Ottawa Citizen
The U.S. Department of State has made it very clear: The security of information on BlackBerrys is not just about
economics.
It's also, in the words of spokesman P. J. Crowley, "about what we think is an important element of democracy,
human rights and freedom of information ... You should be opening up societies to these new technologies that have
the opportunity to empower people ..."
Canada's government has made, at least in public, no such link between BlackBerrys and democratization. It has
not spoken about the potential for authoritarian governments to abuse monitoring privileges. It has decided the
demands placed on Canadian company Research in Motion by the governments of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and India add up to a business story, not a foreign-affairs story.
This is just one example of a larger political failure in Canada to appreciate the full foreign-policy potential of
communication technology.
In the United States, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has called for a "21st-century statecraft" that harnesses tools
such as Twitter and text messages.
Articles this summer in The New York Times Magazine and Foreign Policy have called it "digital diplomacy." Some,
such as Canadian diplomacy expert Daryl Copeland, call it "e-diplomacy."
In 2010, the world sees Canada through YouTube.
"Diplomacy in the international arena is no longer about the big-D diplomat charging in on his white horse and
expounding the virtues of Canada at cocktail parties," says Shauna Sylvester, who was the director of Canada's
World, a three-year non-governmental project consulting citizens about foreign policy.

The United Kingdom's Digital Diplomacy web portal (yes, it has one) defines digital diplomacy as "solving foreign
policy problems using the Internet." Social-media enthusiasts often talk about the wisdom of crowds; post a problem
on the Internet today, and someone, somewhere, will post a solution tomorrow.
No one's likely to craft peace in the Middle East by creating a Facebook page. But Facebook pages, and other
social media, can shift global public opinion in new directions. That, in turn, affects Canada's tourism, trade,
security, immigration.
Canada's government has done some important work in digital diplomacy. "Canada was a pioneer in this field," says
Copeland.
In 2003, for example, Canadian Foreign Minister Bill Graham solicited online comments about policy questions.
In 2005, the government created a virtual network called Connect2Canada.com "for friends of Canada and
Canadians in the United States." It's still going strong and is a good example of 21st-century government
communication, including an "ask the ambassador" link and a YouTube channel.
More recently, the government created an impressive, if unwieldy, interactive site for the G20 summit. It is also
actively "correcting misinformation" in social media when it comes to the seal hunt.
But Sylvester says the enthusiasm for open government seemed to fade after the Conservatives took office in 2006.
"Engagement was no longer part of the government's role."
There are people who get it in the public service today, and some very good initiatives. There are even a few
ministers who get Twitter. But there is no Hillary Clinton pushing the government to do better, no office of digital
diplomacy working on a strategy.
How we do it is almost as important as whether we do it at all. The tactic the government has taken on the seal hunt,
for example, could have the intended effect of countering inaccuracy, or it could come across as a heavy-handed
attempt to control the debale, especially if the government's not simultaneously engaged in more crowd-pleasing
ways to get its message across. Some governments have had fun with social media, opening virtual embassies on
Second Life, for example.
Wikipedia edits are another tricky area. As for seeding Twitter and the blogosphere with Canadian values, it has to
be done with care. Security analyst Peter Jones points out that if, for example, an Iranian blogger becomes too
closely associated with the West, his or her credibility could suffer.
The field of digital diplomacy is new, and fraught with risks. The opportunities, though, are exciting.
In that New York Times Magazine article, Alec Ross, Clinton's senior adviser for innovation, said the key question
for 21st-century statecraft is "Is it open or is it closed?" That's a sensitive question for this Conservative government.
A real advance in e-diplomacy, a real engagement in the split-second, wide-open, on-the-record world of Twitter and
Wikipedia, requires a prime minister who is willing to let public servants and diplomats have a constant unmediated
conversation with the public. It means relinquishing central control of the message.

anyway, whether Canada's part of it or not.

Apparently Secretary Clinton got Mubarak's agreement to release the boys. The father is
headed to Cairo on Monday to pick them up at the embassy. Staff at the embassy and at the
State Dept is now saying that this is only a visitation. As you can imagine the family is
really upset and the supporters are livid. They are expecting that Colin will be headed back
to the states with the boys Tuesday. The press wants to know what is going on. Any advice
here, because I have no idea what is going on? Many thanks to you and esp to Hillary for
getting us this far. Howard

Subject: FW: Secretary Clinton video helps recruit host families!
The Secretary did such a mitzvah by recording a video message for us encouraging American families to host
exchange students. In a few short days the video has had a tremendous impact. We have heard from so many
people who work to recruit host families about what a major effect the video will have on their efforts. One
person even described showing the video on her mobile phone to someone who then agreed on the spot to host
an exchange student for the first time. In addition to the anecdotal stories we are hearing, the video has had
almost 6,500 views on our YouTube page, which is unheard of for an ECA-related video—especially one that's
only been up 2 days!
Recruiting host families and schools is a continual challenge, and is it imperative to the success of our programs
so we are so grateful for her contribution. This little bit will go a very long way. Please pass on our
appreciation to her.

I thought you might appreciate knowing that within the first hour of the video release by the State Department featuring
Secretary Clinton we found a host family! I appreciate the endorsement and recognition from the top at the State
Department for the incredible contributions American families make to youth exchange programs.
I am sharing the message below that we sent this afternoon to our thousands of host families, volunteers and alumni.
Kind regards,

Subject line: Secretary Clinton, my physical therapist's office, and YFU...
Dear fellow YFU'ers,
Earlier this week I was in my physical therapist's office filling out volumes of paperwork. I happened to be wearing my
YFU polo shirt, and the receptionist asked what Youth For Understanding was all about. While I was telling her, my Palm
beeped that I had a new message — it happened to be an email produced by the State Department of Secretary Clinton's
endorsement of hosting and international exchange. I opened the email and clicked on the link. The two receptionists, a
nurse and I huddled around my phone and watched Clinton speak to the importance of global exchange.
Luckily, I had saved several student profiles in my phone and was able to show the receptionists some of the unplaced
students right then and there. I am not sure whether it was the video or the profiles but once I told her my own YFU story,
one of the receptionists was hooked. She already has a student picked out, and her host family application is being
completed today! It feels wonderful to change the life of a teenager thousands of miles away and a newfound friend in my
own backyard.

The Education of a President
These days, Obama has been seeking guidance in presidential biographies. He is reading, among others, "The
Clinton Tapes," Taylor Branch's account of his secret interviews with Bill Clinton during the eight years of his
presidency. "I was looking over some chronicles of the Clinton years," Obama told me, "and was reminded that
in '94 — when President Clinton's poll numbers were lower than mine, and obviously the election ended up
being bad for Democrats — unemployment was only 6.6 percent. And I don't think anybody would suggest that
Bill Clinton wasn't a good communicator or was somebody who couldn't connect with the American people or
didn't show empathy."
In the fall of 1994, things were even better than Obama recalls: unemployment was in fact 5.6 percent. If the
feel-your-pain president had trouble when the economy was not nearly as bad as it is now, with 9.6 percent
unemployment, then maybe the issue for Obama is not that he is too cool or detached, as some pundits say.
When the economy is bad, even the most talented of presidents suffer at the polls. "There is an anti-
establishment mood," Rahm Emanuel, the former Clinton aide who served as Obama's first White House chief
of staff, told me before he stepped down this month. "We just happen to be here when the music is stopping."
It would be bad form for the president to anticipate an election result before it happens, but clearly Obama
hopes that just as Clinton recovered from his party's midterm shellacking in 1994 to win re-election two years
later, so can he. There was something odd in hearing Obama invoke Clinton. Two years ago, Obama scorned
the 42nd president, deriding the small-ball politics and triangulation maneuvers and comparing him unfavorably
with Ronald Reagan. Running against Clinton's wife, Obama was the anti-Clinton. Now he hopes, in a way, to
be the second coming of Bill Clinton. Because, in the end, it's better than being Jimmy Carter.
So it is a high priority for Obama to prevent any intraparty fight in 2012, and to date, despite the fire from the
left, no serious challenger appears on the horizon. Putting Hillary Clinton in the cabinet may turn out to be one
of Obama's smartest moves, because it not only eliminated her as a would-be challenger, but it also should
presumably squelch the will-she-or-won't-she speculation that otherwise would have played out for months.
(Instead, the guessing game has her replacing Biden on the ticket, however fanciful that might be.)

The Education of a President
By PETER BAKER
On a busy afternoon in the West Wing late last month, President Barack Obama seemed relaxed and unhurried
as he sat down in a newly reupholstered brown leather chair in the Oval Office. He had just returned from the
East Room, where he signed the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 — using eight pens so he could give away as
many as possible. The act will be his administration's last piece of significant economic legislation before
voters deliver their verdict on his first two years in office. For all intents and purposes, the first chapter of
Obama's presidency has ended. On Election Day, the next chapter will begin.
As he welcomed me, I told him I liked what he had done with the place. Gone was George W. Bush's yellow
sunburst carpet (it says "optimistic person," Bush would tell practically anyone who visited), and in its place
was a much-derided earth-tone rug with inspirational quotations. The curved walls now had striped tan
wallpaper, and the coffee table had been replaced by a walnut-and-mica table that, Obama noted, would resist
stains from water glasses. The bust of Winston Churchill was replaced by one of Martin Luther King Jr. The
couches were new. He told me he was happy with the redecorating of the office. "I know Arianna doesn't like
it," he said lightly. "But I like taupe."
If there was something incongruous about the president of the United States checking out reviews of his decor
by Arianna Huffington, well, let's face it, he has endured worse reviews lately. The president who muscled
through Congress perhaps the most ambitious domestic agenda in a generation finds himself vilified by the
right, castigated by the left and abandoned by the middle. He heads into the final stretch of the midterm
campaign season facing likely repudiation, with voters preparing to give him a Congress that, even if Democrats
maintain control, will almost certainly be less friendly to the president than the one he has spent the last two
years mud wrestling.
While proud of his record, Obama has already begun thinking about what went wrong — and what he needs to
do to change course for the next two years. He has spent what one aide called "a lot of time talking about
Obama 2.0" with his new interim chief of staff, Pete Rouse, and his deputy chief of staff, Jim Messina. During
our hour together, Obama told me he had no regrets about the broad direction of his presidency. But he did
identify what he called "tactical lessons." He let himself look too much like "the same old tax-and-spend liberal
Democrat." He realized too late that "there's no such thing as shovel-ready projects" when it comes to public
works. Perhaps he should not have proposed tax breaks as part of his stimulus and instead "let the Republicans
insist on the tax cuts" so it could be seen as a bipartisan compromise.
Most of all, he has learned that, for all his anti-Washington rhetoric, he has to play by Washington rules if he
wants to win in Washington. It is not enough to be supremely sure that he is right if no one else agrees with
him. "Given how much stuff was coming at us," Obama told me, "we probably spent much more time trying to
get the policy right than trying to get the politics right. There is probably a perverse pride in my administration
— and I take responsibility for this; this was blowing from the top — that we were going to do the right thing,
even if short-term it was unpopular. And I think anybody who's occupied this office has to remember that
success is determined by an intersection in policy and politics and that you can't be neglecting of marketing and
P.R. and public opinion."
That presumes that what he did was the right thing, a matter of considerable debate. The left thinks he did too
little; the right too much. But what is striking about Obama's self-diagnosis is that by his own rendering, the
figure of inspiration from 2008 neglected the inspiration after his election. He didn't stay connected to the
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771310 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771310 Date: 08/31/2015
people who put him in office in the first place. Instead, he simultaneously disappointed those who considered
him the embodiment of a new progressive movement and those who expected him to reach across the aisle to
usher in a postpartisan age. On the campaign trail lately, Obama has been confronted by disillusionment — the
woman who was "exhausted" defending him, the mother whose son campaigned for him but was now looking
for work. Even Shepard Fairey, the artist who made the iconic multihued "Hope" poster, says he's losing hope.
Perhaps that should have come as no surprise. When Obama secured the Democratic nomination in June 2008,
he told an admiring crowd that someday "we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the
moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless; this was the moment when the
rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal; this was the moment when we ended a war and
secured our nation and restored our image as the last, best hope on earth."
I read that line to Obama and asked how his high-flying rhetoric sounded in these days of low-flying
governance. "It sounds ambitious," he agreed. "But you know what? We've made progress on each of those
fronts." He quoted Mario Cuomo's line about campaigning in poetry and governing in prose. "But the prose and
the poetry match up," he said. "It would be very hard for people to look back and say, You know what, Obama
didn't do what he's promised. I think they could say, On a bunch of fronts he still has an incomplete. But I keep
a checklist of what we committed to doing, and we've probably accomplished 70 percent of the things that we
talked about during the campaign. And I hope as long as I'm president, I've got a chance to work on the other
30 percent."
But save the planet? If you promise to save the planet, might people think you would, you know, actually save
the planet? He laughed, before shifting back to hope and inspiration. "I make no apologies for having set high
expectations for myself and for the country, because I think we can meet those expectations," he said. "Now,
the one thing that I will say — which I anticipated and can be tough — is the fact that in a big, messy
democracy like this, everything takes time. And we're not a culture that's built on patience."
These days, Obama has been seeking guidance in presidential biographies. He is reading, among others, "The
Clinton Tapes," Taylor Branch's account of his secret interviews with Bill Clinton during the eight years of his
presidency. "I was looking over some chronicles of the Clinton years," Obama told me, "and was reminded that
in '94 — when President Clinton's poll numbers were lower than mine, and obviously the election ended up
being bad for Democrats — unemployment was only 6.6 percent. And I don't think anybody would suggest that
Bill Clinton wasn't a good communicator or was somebody who couldn't connect with the American people or
didn't show empathy."
In the fall of 1994, things were even better than Obama recalls: unemployment was in fact 5.6 percent. If the
feel-your-pain president had trouble when the economy was not nearly as bad as it is now, with 9.6 percent
unemployment, then maybe the issue for Obama is not that he is too cool or detached, as some pundits say.
When the economy is bad, even the most talented of presidents suffer at the polls. "There is an anti-
establishment mood," Rahm Emanuel, the former Clinton aide who served as Obama's first White House chief
of staff, told me before he stepped down this month. "We just happen to be here when the music is stopping."
It would be bad form for the president to anticipate an election result before it happens, but clearly Obama
hopes that just as Clinton recovered from his party's midterm shellacking in 1994 to win re-election two years
later, so can he. There was something odd in hearing Obama invoke Clinton. Two years ago, Obama scorned
the 42nd president, deriding the small-ball politics and triangulation maneuvers and comparing him unfavorably
with Ronald Reagan. Running against Clinton's wife, Obama was the anti-Clinton. Now he hopes, in a way, to
be the second coming of Bill Clinton. Because, in the end, it's better than being Jimmy Carter.
Last month, I made my way through the West Wing talking not only with Obama but also with nearly two
dozen of his advisers — some of whom spoke with permission, others without — hoping to understand how the
situation looks to them. The view from inside the administration starts with a basic mantra: Obama inherited the
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771310 Date: 08/31/2015

worst problems of any president in years. Or in generations. Or in American history. He prevented another
Great Depression while putting in place the foundation for a more stable future. But it required him to do
unpopular things that would inevitably cost him.
"He got here, and the expectations for what he could accomplish were very high and probably unrealistic," Pete
Rouse told me. Indeed, David Axelrod and David Plouffe, the masterminds of the 2008 presidential campaign,
said they cautioned Obama after his victory to brace himself for a precipitous drop in his popularity given the
severity of his challenges. "I told him at some point that at the end of '10, his approval rating could be low- to
mid-30s," Plouffe told me.
Yet even if the White House saw it coming, this is an administration that feels shellshocked. Many officials
worry, they say, that the best days of the Obama presidency are behind them. They talk about whether it is time
to move on. While not in the 30s, Obama's approval rating in surveys conducted by The New York Times and
CBS News had fallen to 45 percent last month from 62 percent when he took office —just a point above where
Clinton was before losing Congress in 1994 and three points above where Reagan was before the Republicans
lost a couple dozen House seats in 1982. Joel Benenson, Obama's pollster, pointed out that even at 45 percent,
the president's popularity eclipses that of Congress, the news media, the banks and other forces in American
life. "We are in a time when the American public is highly suspect of any institution," he said, "and President
Obama still stands above that." Obama's team takes pride that he has fulfilled three of the five major promises
he laid out as pillars of his "new foundation" in an April 2009 speech at Georgetown University — health care,
education reform and financial reregulation. And they point to decisions to end the combat mission in Iraq while
escalating the war in Afghanistan. "History will judge Obama that the first two years were very productive,"
Rouse says.
But it is possible to win the inside game and lose the outside game. In their darkest moments, White House
aides wonder aloud whether it is even possible for a modern president to succeed, no matter how many bills he
signs. Everything seems to conspire against the idea: an implacable opposition with little if any real interest in
collaboration, a news media saturated with triviality and conflict, a culture that demands solutions yesterday, a
societal cynicism that holds leadership in low regard. Some White House aides who were ready to carve a new
spot on Mount Rushmore for their boss two years ago privately concede now that he cannot be another
Abraham Lincoln after all. In this environment, they have increasingly concluded, it may be that every modern
president is going to be, at best, average.
"We're all a lot more cynical now," one aide told me. The easy answer is to blame the Republicans, and White
House aides do that with exuberance. But they are also looking at their own misjudgments, the hubris that led
them to think they really could defy the laws of politics. "It's not that we believed our own press or press
releases, but there was definitely a sense at the beginning that we could really change Washington," another
White House official told me. "'Arrogance' isn't the right word, but we were overconfident."
The biggest miscalculation in the minds of most Obama advisers was the assumption that he could bridge a
polarized capital and forge genuinely bipartisan coalitions. While Republican leaders resolved to stand against
Obama, his early efforts to woo the opposition also struck many as halfhearted. "If anybody thought the
Republicans were just going to roll over, we were just terribly mistaken," former Senator Tom Daschle, a
mentor and an outside adviser to Obama, told me. "I'm not sure anybody really thought that, but I think we kind
of hoped the Republicans would go away. And obviously they didn't do that."
Senator Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the upper chamber and Obama's ally from Illinois, said the
Republicans were to blame for the absence of bipartisanship. "I think his fate was sealed," Durbin said. "Once
the Republicans decided they would close ranks to defeat him, that just made it extremely difficult and dragged
it out for a longer period of time. The American people have a limited attention span. Once you convince them
there's a problem, they want a solution."

Gov. Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania, though, is among the Democrats who grade Obama harshly for not being
more nimble in the face of opposition. "B-plus, A-minus on substantive accomplishments," he told me, "and a
D-plus or C-minus on communication." The health care legislation is "an incredible achievement" and the
stimulus program was "absolutely, unqualifiedly, enormously successful," in Rendell's judgment, yet Obama
allowed them to be tarnished by critics. "They lost the communications battle on both major initiatives, and they
lost it early," said Rendell, an ardent Hillary Clinton backer who later became an Obama supporter. "We didn't
use the president in either stimulus or health care until we had lost the spin battle."
That's a refrain heard inside the White House as well: it's a communication problem. The first refuge of any
politician in trouble is that it's a communication problem, not a policy problem. If only I explained what I was
doing better, the people would be more supportive. Which roughly translates to If only you people paid
attention, you wouldn't be kicking me upside the head. Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, laughed
at the ever-ready assumption that all problems stem from poor communication. "I haven't been at a policy-
problem meeting in 20 months," he noted.
The policy criticism of Obama can be confusing and deeply contradictory — he is a liberal zealot, in the view
of the right; a weak accommodationist, in the view of the left. He is an anticapitalist socialist who is too cozy
with Wall Street, a weak-on-defense apologist for America who adopted Bush's unrelenting antiterror tactics at
the expense of civil liberties.
"When he talked about being a transformational president, it was about restoring the faith of the American
people in our governing institutions," says Ken Duberstein, the former Reagan White House chief of staff who
voted for Obama in 2008. "What we now know is that that did not work. If anything, people are even more
dubious about all of our institutions, especially government. So to that extent, the transformational side has not
worked. And frankly I would settle these days — forget about transformational, how about a transactional
president, somebody people could do business with? It seems there's an ideological rigidity that the American
people did not sense."
The other side would like more ideological rigidity. Norman Solomon, a leading progressive activist and the
president of the Institute for Public Accuracy, said Obama has "totally blown this great opportunity" to reinvent
America by being more aggressive on issues like a public health care option. Other liberals feel the same way
about gays in the military or the prison at Guantanamo Bay. "It's been so reflexive since he was elected, to just
give ground and give ground," Solomon told me. "If we don't call him a wimp, which may be the wrong word,
he just seems to be backpedaling." Solomon added: "It makes people feel angry and perhaps used. People just
feel like, Gee, we really believed in this guy, and his rhetoric is so different than the way he's behaved in
office."
Pummeled from both sides, Obama clearly seems frustrated and, at times, defensive. At a Labor Day event in
Milwaukee, he complained that the special interests treat him badly. "They're not always happy with me," he
told supporters. "They talk about me like a dog — that's not in my prepared remarks, but it's true."
The friendly fire may bother him even more. "Democrats just congenitally tend to see the glass as half empty,"
Obama said at a fund-raiser in Greenwich, Conn., last month. "If we get an historic health care bill passed —
oh, well, the public option wasn't there. If you get the financial reform bill passed — then, well, I don't know
about this particular derivatives rule, I'm not sure that I'm satisfied with that. And, gosh, we haven't yet brought
about world peace. I thought that was going to happen quicker."
Then again, it is Obama himself, and not just his supporters, who casts his presidency in grandiose terms. As he
pleaded with Democrats for patience at another fund-raiser in Washington two weeks later: "It took time to free
the slaves. It took time for women to get the vote. It took time for workers to get the right to organize."

One morning around the 100-day mark in Obama's administration, the president and his top aides gathered for
their morning meeting in the Oval Office. As they waited for David Axelrod, who was running late, someone
noted the coming milestone and asked Obama what surprised him most since taking office. "The number of
people who don't pay their taxes," he answered sardonically.
From the start, Obama has been surprised by all sorts of challenges that have made it hard for him to govern —
not just the big problems that he knew about, like the economy and the wars, but also the myriad little ones that
hindered his progress, like one nominee after another brought down by unpaid taxes. Obama trusted his
judgment and seemed to have assumed that impressive people in his own party must have a certain basic sense
of integrity — and that impressive people in the other party must want to work with him.
Four of the five presidents previous to Obama were governors who came to Washington vowing to fix it, only
to realize that Washington defies the easy, and often hollow, rhetoric of change. While Obama was a senator
when he set off on the campaign trail, he made the same pledges and has encountered the same reality. "The
story of the first two years is the inherent conflict between a guy who ran from outside to change Washington,
gets here and the situation was even worse than we thought it was," a senior aide told me. "Here's a guy who
ran as an outsider to change Washington who all of a sudden realized that just to deal with these issues, we were
going to have to work with Washington to fix that."
Obama does little to disguise his disdain for Washington and the conventions of modern politics. When he
emerges from the Oval Office during the day, aides say, he sometimes pauses before the split-screen television
in the outer reception area, soaks in the cable chatter, then shakes his head and walks away. "He's still never
gotten comfortable here," a top White House official told me. He has little patience for what Valerie Jarrett, a
senior adviser, calls "the inevitable theatrics of Washington."
But in politics, theater matters, whether it should or not, a lesson Obama keeps relearning, however grudgingly.
His decision to redecorate the Oval Office was criticized as an unnecessary luxury in a time of austerity, no
matter that it was paid for by private funds. On the campaign trail, he thought it was silly to wear a flag pin, as
if that were a measure of his patriotism, until his refusal to wear a flag pin generated distracting criticism and
one day he showed up wearing one. Likewise, he thought it was enough to pray in private while living in the
White House, and then a poll showed that most Americans weren't sure he's Christian; sure enough, a few
weeks later, he attended services at St. John's Church across from Lafayette Square, photographers in tow.
Obama came to office with enormous faith in his own powers of persuasion. He seemed to believe he could
overcome divisions if he just sat down with the world's most recalcitrant figures — whether they be the mullahs
in Tehran or the Republicans on Capitol Hill. As it turned out, the candidate who said he would be willing to
meet in his first year with some of America's enemies "without precondition" has met with none of them. And
the president who in his State of the Union address this year promised to meet monthly with leaders of both
parties in Congress ended up doing so just half as often.
He has yet to fully decide whether he is of Washington or apart from it. During the health care debate, Obama
had Emanuel cut deals with the pharmaceutical industry, while Axelrod presented the president as above the old
business as usual. "Perhaps we were naïve," Axelrod told me. "First, he's always had good relations across
party lines. And secondly, I think he believed that in the midst of a crisis you could find partners on the other
side of the aisle to help deal with it. I don't think anyone here expected the degree of partisanship that we
confronted." Emanuel said Republicans adopted a strategy of poisoning the public well. "Part of what they were
doing was not just making us grind it out," he told me. "They were souring the country on the mood of the
country."
Still, Obama plays the partisan game as well. After months of quiet negotiations, some administration officials
thought they were close to a package of new financial regulations with Republican support when, to their
chagrin, the White House decided to use the issue to wage a high-profile and politically useful battle with Wall

Street special interests. At that point, the chances for a deal across party lines collapsed, administration officials
said, and Obama was left to rely almost entirely on Democratic votes.
Obama advisers who left the White House recently have been struck how different, and worse, things look from
the outside. As he made a round of corporate job interviews after stepping down as White House budget
director, Peter Orszag was stunned to discover how deep the gulf between the president and business had
become. "I'd thought it was an 8, but it's more like a 10," he told me. "And rather than wasting time debating
whether it's legitimate," he added, referring to his former colleagues, "the key is to recognize that it's affecting
what they do."
Insulation is a curse of every president, but more than any president since Jimmy Carter, Obama comes across
as an introvert, someone who finds extended contact with groups of people outside his immediate circle to be
draining. He can rouse a stadium of 80,000 people, but that audience is an impersonal monolith; smaller group
settings can be harder for him. Aides have learned that it can be good if he has a few moments after a big East
Room event so he can gather his energy again. Unlike Clinton, who never met a rope line he did not want to
work, Obama does not relish glad-handing. That's what he has Vice President Joe Biden for. When Obama
addressed the Business Roundtable this year, he left after his speech without much meet-and-greet, leaving his
aides frustrated that he had done himself more harm than good. He is not much for chitchat. When he and I sat
down, he started our session matter-of-factly: "All right," he said, "fire away."
By all accounts, Obama copes with his political troubles with equanimity. "Zen" is the word commonly used in
the West Wing. That's not to say he never loses his temper. He has been known to snap at aides when he feels
overscheduled. He cuts off advisers who spout information straight from briefing papers with a testy "I've
already read that." He does not like it when aides veer out of their assigned lanes, yet they have learned to show
up at meetings with an opinion, because he zeroes in on those who stay silent. He was subdued during the Gulf
of Mexico oil spill, when he found himself largely powerless. Other presidents took refuge at Camp David, but
Michelle Obama has told dinner guests that her husband does not care for it all that much, because he is an
urban guy. He blows off steam on the White House basketball court. "Come on, man, you've got to make that
shot," he chides aides who play with him.
The most obvious sign of strain is in his hair. "He'll probably be unhappy with me for saying, but I've noticed
he's gotten a little grayer," Defense Secretary Robert Gates told me over the summer. "These kinds of decisions
do that to people." But the stress of the job remains mostly unspoken. "We usually will talk about writing the
condolence letters," Gates added. "But other than that, we don't dwell on it." If anything, Obama more often
than not bucks up young members of his staff, reminding them that politics, like life, is full of cycles and they
will someday be able to tell their children that they were part of something big.
While Clinton made late-night phone calls around Washington to vent or seek advice, Obama rarely reaches
outside the tight group of advisers like Emanuel, Axelrod, Rouse, Messina, Plouffe, Gibbs and Jarrett, as well as
a handful of personal friends. "He's opaque even to us," an aide told me. "Except maybe for a few people in the
inner circle, he's a closed book." In part because of security, just 15 people have his BlackBerry e-mail address.
On long Air Force One flights, he retreats to the conference room and plays spades for hours, maintaining a
trash-talking contest all the while, with the same three aides: Reggie Love, his personal assistant; Marvin
Nicholson, his trip director; and Pete Souza, his White House photographer. (When I asked if he had an iPad,
Obama said, "I have an iReggie, who has my books, my newspapers, my music all in one place.")
Jarrett attributes Obama's equilibrium to his upbringing. "He's really different," she told me. "It's rooted in his
sense of self and how he grew up with a single mom, living at times on food stamps, working as a community
organizer." As Gibbs put it: "He has a remarkable way of focusing on the big picture and the longer term. It's
not to say that he's immune from criticism. But he can categorize in his head the difference between what's a
setback, what's a bump along the way and what's just noise."

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771310 Date: 08/31/2015
There is certainly no shortage of noise. But as Obama gets back on the campaign trail, aides have noticed his
old spirit again. He particularly enjoys the so-called backyard sessions on the lawns of supporters. "That's the
happiest I've seen him in a long time," an aide said. After one, Obama told the aide, "This reminds me of Iowa
on the bus."
Nostalgia for the good old days of the campaign afflicts any White House in trouble. After all, those were the
romantic moments when all was possible, when tens of thousands of people would gather in Grant Park to tear
up over the promise of what will be. But in sober moments, Obama understands how selective the memories
really are. "The mythology has emerged somehow that we ran this flawless campaign, I never made a mistake,
that we were master communicators, everything worked in lock step," he told me. "And somehow now, as
president, things are messy and they don't always work as planned and people are mad at us. That's not how I
look at stuff, because I remember what the campaign was like. And it was just as messy and just as difficult.
And there were all sorts of moments when our supporters lost hope, and it looked like we weren't going to win.
And we're going through that same period here."
In covering the last three presidents, I have watched as each has been tested, albeit in very different
circumstances — Clinton's impeachment over false testimony under oath about an affair with a White House
intern, Bush's drive to begin a war that would drag on for years at enormous cost and Obama's struggle to turn
around the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. They are starkly variable crises, but some
dynamics are familiar: presidents who live and die by polls insist they are not important when they fall; they
argue that they are focused on principle, not politics, when it's almost always a mixture of both; they
acknowledge difficulties but say they will pass; they portray themselves as courageous when flying against
public opinion; they complain that the news media distort the situation and fuel division; they blame their
opponents for practicing the politics of destruction and obstruction.
Talking with Obama and his aides, it's eerie to hear echoes of Clinton and Bush. Obama says the easy issues
never make it to him, only the hard ones; Bush often said the same thing. Obama says our war with terrorists
will never end in a surrender ceremony; Bush often said the same thing. Obama says he does not want to kick
problems down the road; Bush often said the same thing. In the days leading up to the 1994 midterm elections,
Clinton mocked Republicans for promising to balance the budget while cutting taxes, saying, "They're not
serious." In our conversation, Obama used some variation of the phrase "they're not serious" four times in
referring to Republican budget plans.
That is not to say the three men are alike; indeed, they are vastly different. But putting ideology aside, Obama at
times seems to be a cross between his two predecessors. Like Clinton, he digs into the intellectual
underpinnings of a policy decision, studying briefing books and seeking a range of opinions. Some aides
express frustration that he can leave decisions unresolved for too long. But like Bush, once he has made a
decision, Obama rarely revisits it. And like Bush, he runs a pretty disciplined operation; he started our interview
a half-hour ahead of schedule, just as Bush sometimes did. Clinton, on the other hand, still runs on Clinton
Standard Time. Just a few weeks ago, he was more than six hours late for a scheduled interview with another
journalist. One constant among all three: It took Clinton and Bush some time to really grow into the presidency,
until they wore it comfortably.
As Obama looks to the experiences of Clinton and Reagan, who both rebounded from midterm debacles to win
re-election, the lessons differ. In Reagan's case, the House was already in Democratic hands, so during his first
two years, he forged coalitions of Republicans and conservative Democrats. After the opposition was
strengthened in the 1982 elections, that was no longer viable, and Reagan began working more with Democratic
leaders. Clinton likewise changed course after the 1994 elections, emphasizing more incremental, piece-by-
piece change rather than sweeping proposals and pursuing goals like welfare reform and balanced budgets when
he could agree with Newt Gingrich's new majority.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771310 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771310 Date: 08/31/2015
Clinton, though, was more instinctively centrist than Obama is, and his revival owed much to other factors,
particularly his leadership after the Oklahoma City bombing and his budget standoff with Gingrich during the
partial government shutdown. Some argue Obama might be better off with at least one Republican chamber so
he too has a foil as Clinton did. But it is unclear if Obama is as agile a politician as Reagan or Clinton. "He's no
Bill Clinton when it comes to having the ability to move and to wiggle," says Joe Gaylord, a top Gingrich
adviser. "I find rigidity in Obama that comes from his life in liberalism." Ken Duberstein likewise doubts
Obama's capacity for adjustment. "They're much better at the art of campaigning than the art of governing," he
said.
Perhaps the more important historical pattern to consider is this one: The last four presidents who failed to win a
second term were all challenged in their own party. Lyndon Johnson was driven out of the race in 1968 after
nearly losing the New Hampshire primary to Eugene McCarthy. Gerald Ford fended off Reagan in 1976 but
went on to lose the general election to Carter, who likewise had to beat a primary challenger four years later,
Ted Kennedy, before falling to Reagan. And George H. W. Bush had to overcome Patrick Buchanan before
losing to Clinton in 1992.
So it is a high priority for Obama to prevent any intraparty fight in 2012, and to date, despite the fire from the
left, no serious challenger appears on the horizon. Putting Hillary Clinton in the cabinet may turn out to be one
of Obama's smartest moves, because it not only eliminated her as a would-be challenger, but it also should
presumably squelch the will-she-or-won't-she speculation that otherwise would have played out for months.
(Instead, the guessing game has her replacing Biden on the ticket, however fanciful that might be.)
As the first African-American president, Obama is more aware than most of the limits of looking back. But he
also has read enough presidential biographies to know he is not the first to encounter rocky times. "History
never precisely repeats itself," Obama told me. "But there is a pattern in American presidencies — at least
modern presidencies. You come in with excitement and fanfare. The other party initially, having been beaten,
says it wants to cooperate with you. You start implementing your program as you promised during the
campaign. The other party pushes back very hard. It causes a lot of consternation and drama in Washington.
People who are already cynical and skeptical about Washington generally look at it and say, This is the same
old mess we've seen before. The president's poll numbers drop. And you have to then sort of wrestle back the
confidence of the people as the programs that you've put in place start bearing fruit."
To better understand history, and his role in it, Obama invited a group of presidential scholars to dinner in
May in the living quarters of the White House. Obama was curious about, among other things, the Tea Party
movement. Were there precedents for this sort of backlash against the establishment? What sparked them and
how did they shape American politics? The historians recalled the Know-Nothings in the 1850s, the Populists in
the 1890s and Father Charles Coughlin in the 1930s. "He listened," the historian H. W. Brands told me. "What
he concluded, I don't know."
Obama's conclusions are still being formed. He has learned that "Washington is even more broken than we
thought," as one aide put it. He has trusted his own judgment as he disregarded advisers who told him to scale
back health care at various stages. And he has found that his vaunted speaking skills are not enough to change
the dynamics of governance. "One of the lessons he has to learn is What is the best form of communication for
him with the American people," the historian Doris Kearns Goodwin told me. "He's so good in front of an
audience, and I get the sense that he needs the energy off the audience. And so speaking to television cameras
doesn't really do that."
As we talked in the Oval Office, Obama acknowledged that the succession of so many costly initiatives,
necessary as they may have been, wore on the public. "That accumulation of numbers on the TV screen night in
and night out in those first six months I think deeply and legitimately troubled people," he told me. "They
started feeling like: Gosh, here we are tightening our belts, we're cutting out restaurants, we're cutting out our

gym membership, in some cases we're not buying new clothes for the kids. And here we've got these folks in
Washington who just seem to be printing money and spending it like nobody's business.
"And it reinforced the narrative that the Republicans wanted to promote anyway, which was Obama is not a
different kind of Democrat — he's the same old tax-and-spend liberal Democrat."
Emanuel told me that the cascading crises in Obama's early days exacted a lasting toll. "The seeds of his
political difficulty today were planted in taking those steps," he said. White House officials largely agree they
should not have let the health care process drag out while waiting for Republican support that would never
come. "It's not what people felt they sent Barack Obama to Washington to do, to be legislator in chief," a top
adviser told me. "It lent itself to the perception that he wasn't doing anything on the economy." Plouffe agreed
that guilt by association with Democratic lawmakers did not help. "When you swim in those waters, you're
going to be affected by that," he said. "I do think he's paid a political price, somewhat, for having to be tied to
Congress."
Still, for all the second-guessing, what you do not hear in the White House is much questioning of the basic
elements of the program — Obama aides, liberal and moderate alike, reject complaints from the right that the
stimulus did not help the economy or that health care expands government too much, as well as complaints
from the left that he should have pushed for a bigger stimulus package or held out for a public health care
option. "We asked for more stimulus than we ended up with," Larry Summers, the outgoing national economics
adviser, told me. "But we fought as hard as we could, and I believe we got as much as Congress was ever going
to give us at that time."
And they argue that any mistakes affected things only at the margins. "There's all this talk in this town — if we
had done energy before health care, if we had focused more on small business, if we had done an Oval on the
economy instead of Iraq, we would be doing better," Dan Pfeiffer, the communications director, says. "I don't
believe that. We could always do things differently, and there are plenty of things I wish I had back. But I don't
know they'd change the overall trend."
Melody Barnes, the president's domestic-policy adviser, says the biggest problem was that after eight years of
Bush, Obama's supporters were very eager to change everything right away. "The pent-up demand across every
issue area — around science, around education, around health care, immigration, you name it — there was a lot
of desire to finally get these things done," she told me. "Every segment of the population had something that
was very important to them that they really wanted to put over the finish line."
Obama is preaching patience in an impatient age. One prominent Democratic lawmaker told me Obama's
problem is that he is not insecure — he always believes he is the smartest person in any room and never feels
the sense of panic that makes a good politician run scared all the time, frenetically wooing lawmakers, power
brokers, adversaries and voters as if the next election were a week away.
Instead, what you hear Obama aides talking about is that the system is "not on the level." That's a phrase
commonly used around the West Wing — "it's not on the level." By that, they mean the Republicans, the news
media, the lobbyists, the whole Washington culture is not serious about solving problems. The challenge, as
they see it, is how to rise above a town that can obsess for a week on whether an obscure Agriculture
Department official in Georgia should have been fired. At the same time, as Emanuel told me, "We have to play
the game."
As Brands, the historian, put it, "It'll be really interesting to see if a president who is thinking long term can
have an impact on a political system that is almost irredeemably short term in its perspective."
"I'd rather be a really good one-term president than a mediocre two-term president." So Obama told Diane
Sawyer of ABC News last January at another low point, just after the Republican Scott Brown captured the

Massachusetts Senate seat held for decades by Ted Kennedy, costing Democrats their filibuster-proof control of
the upper chamber and jeopardizing the president's health care plan.
It's a good line, but it's one of those things easier said in the first or second year of a presidency. By the third, it
starts to become an actual choice. Forks in the road require a president to decide if he will advance ideas that
will genuinely change the country even if deeply unpopular or if he will opt instead for a safer route that does
not put re-election at risk. Obama aides like to argue that he has already demonstrated willingness to put aside
politics by bailing out the banks and automakers, decisions that he saw as critical to preventing greater
economic catastrophe (and that ultimately cost taxpayers far less than initially feared).
But would he jeopardize re-election absent an immediate crisis? The choice may confront him soon after the
midterms when his bipartisan fiscal commission reports back by Dec. 1 with plans to tame the national deficit
with a politically volatile menu of unpalatable options, like scaling back Medicare and Social Security while
raising taxes. Obama also anticipates putting immigration reform, another divisive issue fraught with political
danger, back on the table. "If the question is, Over the next two years do I take a pass on tough stuff," he told
me, "the answer is no."
Obama's aides say they will most likely set up their re-election campaign around next March, roughly the same
as when Bush and Clinton incorporated their incumbent campaign operations. They are more optimistic about
2012 than they are about 2010, believing the Tea Party will re-elect Barack Obama by pulling the Republican
nominee to the right. They doubt Sarah Palmn will run and figure Mitt Romney cannot get the Republican
nomination because he enacted his own health care program in Massachusetts. If they had to guess today, some
in the White House say that Obama will find himself running against Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas
governor.
With that campaign on the horizon, Obama asked Pete Rouse and Jim Messina to begin thinking about the next
phase of his presidency, not just personnel but also priorities and message. Never mind that Rouse was among
those who wanted to leave — for years, he has been saying he wanted out of politics but never says no to
Obama. Indeed, when Rouse told colleagues he wanted to leave the White House by the end of this year,
Messina bet him $400 that he would not. "We'll see what happens," Rouse told me when I asked about the bet
last month. Then Obama made Rouse interim chief of staff. Rouse initially resisted moving into Rahm
Emanuel's corner suite until colleagues threatened to move his files for him. Messina jokes that Rouse will turn
off the Oval Office lights after eight years and before assuming his new job, running Obama's presidential
library.
Rouse is managing a slow-motion White House shuffle. By year's end, there will be a new chief of staff, a new
national-economics adviser, a new budget director, a new chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and a
new national-security adviser, among others. Axelrod and Messina expect to leave by spring to set up Obama's
re-election effort, and Plouffe will almost certainly come into the White House in a senior role.
"There are a lot of lessons learned in the last two years in terms of how we might improve internal
communication, encourage greater accountability without discouraging individual initiative," said one aide
familiar with the discussions led by Rouse and Messina. Obama has been aggravated by friction among his
advisers. "He's a little frustrated with the internal dysfunction," the aide said. "He doesn't like confrontation."
But his initial choices to fill open slots have been drawn largely from his administration, suggesting more
continuity than change.
Rouse and Messina see areas for possible bipartisan agreement, like reauthorizing the nation's education laws to
include reform measures favored by centrists and conservatives, passing long-pending trade pacts and possibly
even producing scaled-back energy legislation. "You'll hear more about exports and less about public
spending," a senior White House official said. "You'll hear more about initiative and private sector and less
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771310 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771310 Date: 08/31/2015
about the Department of Energy. You'll hear more about government as a financier and less about government
as a hirer."
Obama expressed optimism to me that he could make common cause with Republicans after the midterm
elections. "It may be that regardless of what happens after this election, they feel more responsible," he said,
"either because they didn't do as well as they anticipated, and so the strategy of just saying no to everything and
sitting on the sidelines and throwing bombs didn't work for them, or they did reasonably well, in which case the
American people are going to be looking to them to offer serious proposals and work with me in a serious way."
I asked if there were any Republicans he trusted enough to work with on economic issues. The first name he
came up with was Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, who initially agreed to serve as Obama's commerce
secretary before changing his mind. But Gregg is retiring. The only other Republican named by Obama was
Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin congressman who has put together a detailed if politically problematic blueprint for
reducing federal spending. The two men are ideologically poles apart, but perhaps Obama sees a bit of himself
in a young, substantive policy thinker.
Even if such an alliance emerges, though, the next two years will be mostly about cementing what Obama did in
his first two years — and defending it against challenges in Congress and the courts. "Even if! had the exact
same Congress, even if we don't lose a seat in the Senate and we don't lose a seat in the House, I think the
rhythms of the next two years would inevitably be different from the rhythms of the first two years," Obama
told me. "There's going to be a lot of work in this administration just doing things right and making sure that
new laws are stood up in the ways they're intended."
As a senior adviser put it, "There's going to be very little incentive for big things over the next two years unless
there's some sort of crisis." Yet Obama and his aides still scorn Bill Clinton's small-bore approach. "It's fair to
assume you're not going to see school uniforms play a big role in the next two years," Plouffe told me. "His
view is you can't spend two years playing four-corners." Before he left, Emanuel told me: "I'm not of the view
that you do nothing. I think you've got to have an agenda."
But what sort of agenda? Not as sweeping and not as provocative, say some advisers. "It will have to be limited
and focused on the things that are achievable and high priorities for the American people," Dick Durbin told
me. Tom Daschle said Obama would have to reach out to adversaries. "The lessons of the last two years are
going to be critical," he told me. "The key word is 'inclusion.' He's got to find ways to be inclusive."
Rendell thinks otherwise. "Don't care so much about bipartisanship if the Republicans continue to refuse to
cooperate," he advised. "Do what you have to do. Fight back." At the same time, he said, stop moaning about
what he inherited: "After the election, I'd say no more pointing back, no more blaming the Bush administration.
It's O.K. to do that during the campaign and then stop. But to do it as much as we do it, it sounds like a broken
record. And after two years, you own it."
Obama will own it for another two years, or six if he can find his way forward. As an author, Obama
appreciates the rhythms of a tumultuous story. But who is the protagonist, really? At bottom, this president is
still a mystery to many Americans. During the campaign, he sold himself— or the idea of himself— more than
any particular policy, and voters filled in the lines as they chose. He was, as he said at the time, the ultimate
Rorschach test.
Now the lines are being filled in further. With each choice Obama makes, he further defines himself for better
or worse in Americans' minds. He says he knows where he is going and is gathering momentum despite the
hurdles ahead. As he told a group of visitors during the week last spring that Congress passed health care and
his administration reached agreement on an arms-control treaty with Russia, "I start slow, but I finish strong."
He will have to, if the history he is writing is to turn out the way he prefers.

Goodwin is in DC and met with Reid's staff. It looks like he is really going to go ahead and file cloture!! See
also the article from the BLT today.
Goodwin also met with Feinstein, which was a difficult meeting. If you have time, I'd like to confidentially
discuss with you. I can set my alarm to get up and talk to you at 6 or 6:30 a.m. in the morning your time if that
is the best time to reach you. Are you still at
Thanks!

Democrats Plan Votes on Controversial Nominees, Senator Says
President Barack Obama's nominees for the federal judiciary have stalled for months in part because of heated
disagreement over a handful of nominees. Now, Senate Democrats are looking at forcing votes on four of
them.
Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said today that Democrats could move soon to end debate on the nominees.
He said that Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) was lining up support this morning for what's known as a
cloture petition — the necessary paperwork before holding a vote to end debate.
"He's lining up the signatures," Whitehouse said after a meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Such a
petition requires 16 signatures.
Whitehouse is a vocal supporter of one of the nominees who have drawn fire: John McConnell Jr., a Motley
Rice partner who's been nominated for federal district court in Rhode Island. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce
is opposing McConnell's nomination, citing his work as a plaintiffs' lawyer on lead paint litigation and other
cases.
The other three nominees whom Reid is trying to force votes on, Whitehouse said, are Goodwin Liu for the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, Edward Chen for the Northern District of California and Louis
Butler for the Western District of Wisconsin. Republicans have targeted all three because of what they call the
nominees' extreme views, while the nominees' home-state senators and other supporters argue they're being
treated unfairly.
A fifth nominee whom Republicans oppose, Judge Robert Chatigny for the 2nd Circuit, is pending before the
Senate Judiciary Committee. A committee vote is planned for Thursday.
Though senators have many other priorities during their "lame duck" session, Whitehouse said he thinks there
is time to consider the stalled nominees. Otherwise, he said, "there'd be no point getting the signatures" for the
cloture petition.
Senate rules require 60 votes to end debate on a nominee or a bill, unless senators agree to waive a vote
entirely. Democrats control 59 Senate seats until January.
On Monday, conservatives sent a letter to Reid asking him not to force votes on any nominees between the
midterm elections and the start of the next Congress. "Any lame-duck' confirmations would be a gross abuse
of Congressional authority in a last gasp attempt to perpetuate an agenda that the American people have
already rejected," the letter says.

BERLIN (Reuters) - An Iranian woman whose sentence of execution by stoning for adultery provoked a worldwide outcry
will instead be hanged for murder on November 3, a human rights group said.
"The authorities in Tehran have given the go-ahead to Tabriz prison for the execution of Iran stoning case Sakineh
Mohammadi Ashtiani," the International Committee against Stoning, a German-based campaign group, said on its
website.
"It has been reported that she is to be executed this Wednesday, 3 November."
Officials in Iran were not available to confirm or deny the report.

We've been in touch with Ambassador Susan Jacobs--she is on the road now, but I understand that she did speak with
Mr. Bower earlier today. We are keeping her posted on all of these developments.
Someone is apparently providing the Bower family with misinformed "readouts" of both the Secretary's meeting with
President Mubarak last week and Senator Kerry's phone call with President Mubarak yesterday (Friday)--and these
"readouts" do not/not conform with what we understand actually took place. We do not know the source of this
misinformation. When our officers have tried to explain the state of play, the family cite other unspecified sources
telling them that the boys will be released.
I intend to see Mr. Bower when he is here either tomorrow or Monday and hope to get us back onto the same page.

There is no/no indication that the GOE intends to intervene in the judicial process which has yet to fully hear Mr.
Bower's legal challenge to his wife's Egyptian custody order. As I read the read-out of Sen Kerry call to President
Mubarak (forwarded in separate email), Mubarak said he could not intervene in the judicial process.
The next hearing is set for October.
A meeting on Sept 20th has been set for Mr. Bowers, the Egyptian "Good Intentions Committee"
which is an extra-judicial group of officials who try to facilitate resolution of custody cases involving foreign parents (but
the committee has no authority to order the children's return to Mr. Bowers), and the ex-wife, and possibly the children.
We have been urging the GOE to assure that the boys are available to see their father on the 20th. We do not expect
that the boys will be released to him and do not understand how the family came to believe this.

Apparently Secretary Clinton got Mubarak's agreement to release the boys. The father is headed to Cairo on Monday to
pick them up at the embassy. Staff at the embassy and at the State Dept is now saying that this is only a visitation. As
you can imagine the family is really upset and the supporters are livid. They are expecting that Colin will be headed back
to the states with the boys Tuesday. The press wants to know what is going on. Any advice here, because I have no idea
what is going on? Many thanks to you and esp to Hillary for getting us this far. Howard

Elections
With some 20 seats still undecided, Republicans have already picked up 61 seats in House; Democrats likely to
keep 51-53 seats in Senate. Spratt and Skelton losses are among more significant; H will prepare an analysis of
election's impact on our oversight committees. Murkowski appears to be headed for historic write-in win; her
support of Law of Sea and likely sympathy for New START will be good for us. Reid will likely return to
Washington energized by win to pursue consequential lame duck session. Manchin and Kirk will take up their
seats in the Senate this month; Rich suggests S calls to each to help lock in support for New START.
Other Congressional issues
Tom Nides' prep going well, and he'll see SFRC members and Sem Gilibrand this week. Rich expects
committee will vote him out during lame duck; still unclear if we'll get floor vote. An inter-agency team Will
brief the Hill this week on the President's Asia trip. Kerry will leave for the Middle East, including Syria, on
Sunday.
Guantanamo Closure
DOJ is considering Harold's latest paper on the way forward.
Iran
Kouchner announced after conversation with Iranian FM Mottaki that adultery convict Ashtiani will not be
imminently executed, as earlier reported. Jundullah designation being announced this morning.
India
Roemer and Blake making good progress on nuclear liability issue, but we are not yet ready to raise public
expectations.
Iraq

The spectre of a global food crisis has reared its head again. Soaring corn prices, which on Monday recorded their biggest
one-day rise since 1973, have triggered fears of a return to the turmoil of 2007-2008. Far-reaching measures are needed
to prevent a recurrence.
Rising prices over the last decade are in part the result of burgeoning demand from emerging markets such as China and
India. The emergence of commodities as a distinct asset class has also put upward pressure on prices. Commodity index-
fund investment has soared over the last decade. Non-food commodities, in particular metals, have been equally affected.
Copper and tin prices hit record highs last week.
Shocks on the supply side, in particular adverse weather events, have also contributed. Droughts in eastern Europe and
heavy rains in North America this summer sent grain and oilseed prices soaring.
In the long run the market is likely to respond to higher prices by boosting production. Increases in productivity and
innovations such as genetically modified crops will help supply to catch up with demand, bringing food prices down to

more affordable levels.
But governments need to do a better job of managing shocks when they occur — and in doing so must not suppress the
price mechanism. Actions taken to alleviate shortages have often undermined production when it is most needed. Export
bans, such as that introduced by Russia in August, discourage productive investment by denying producers the windfall of
selling to international markets. Direct food aid does the same by undercutting farmers in developing countries.
A mechanism is needed to keep markets open during volatile periods, however politically difficult this is. Rich countries
should also continue to replace food aid with development assistance that boosts agricultural productivity. Initiatives such
as Hillary Clinton's Feed the Future programme, which aims to give small-scale farmers access to new technologies, are
much needed.
Poor countries are not without remedy. Larger food reserves will help to relieve shortages. Investing in irrigation and
other measures to improve land quality will accelerate productivity growth. Rich countries should help to finance such
Investments.
We are beginning to realise that the era of food surpluses has come to an end. How policymakers respond will determine
whether the turbulence of recent months becomes a regular occurrence.

In Kosovo crazy for the Clintons
By Mary Beth Sheridan
Washington Post Staff Writer
Wednesday, October 13, 2010; 9:41 AM
PRISTINA, KOSOVO- This poor, tiny corner of Europe turned into the Land of Clinton on Wednesday, with thousands of
Kosovo residents turning out to greet Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and pay homage to her husband.
Former president Bill Clinton is revered here for his role in ending the Yugoslav "ethnic cleansing" campaign of the late
1990s.
Arriving in Pristina, Clinton's motorcade slowed to a halt on the central Bill Clinton Boulevard, and she hopped out of her
car to personally inspect an 11-foot gold statue of the former president. She waved and smiled as a crowd brandished
American flags, applauded and chanted "Hill-a-REE!! Hill-a-REE!"
Above the little plaza, an image of Clinton grinned from a giant billboard. Hillary Clinton's face beamed from another
billboard nearby, bearing the word "Welcome."
After posing for photos with the Bill Clinton statue, the secretary of state ducked into the Hillary boutique next door.
As she emerged, a local reporter approached. "Do you like it?" the reporter asked, gesturing to the statue. "Your
husband."
"Yes! And look, a store with my name," said the secretary of state, holding a shopping bag inscribed "Boutique Hillary."
Asked what she thought of Kosovo, Hillary Clinton replied, "I'm so glad to be back after 10 years. It's wonderful."
The chief U.S. diplomat was concluding a three-day Balkan tour that also took her to Bosnia and Serbia.
During her husband's administration, NATO bombed Yugoslavia to force it to end an "ethnic cleansing" campaign in
Kosovo, a breakaway province largely populated by ethnic Albanians.
Kosovo declared independence in 2008.

USGLC Looks Forward to Working with the 112th Congress to Protect
National Security
Washington, DC— The U.S. Global Leadership Coalition today released the following statement from Executive
Director Liz Schrayer on the preview of the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review:
"As part of the USGLC's Impact '08 initiative, a bipartisan working group of foreign policy experts called on the next
administration to conduct a Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. We believed such a review was a vital
step in modernizing our civilian-led tools of global engagement, and we congratulate Secretary Clinton and
Administrator Shah for tackling this monumental and necessary task.
"The preview of the QDDR released last week represents a bold step towards implementing a smart power foreign policy
by elevating our civilian power and ensuring effective, results-driven programs. While we have not seen the full report
and expect varying views on some of the recommendations, the initial outline includes several significant highlights that

Inside W.H., calls for shake-up
By: Glenn Thrush
November 3, 2010 10:30 AM EDT
Some of the calls for a White House shake-up are now coming from inside the building.
Frustrated current and former West Wing staffers, speaking on condition of anonymity,
told POLITICO they hoped Tuesday night's humbling losses would persuade President
Barack Obama to pursue a much more sweeping fix than just the "natural" post-election
churn of personnel his administration has insisted will take place.
Many of those changes are already being seriously considered, among them: replacing
Political Director Patrick Gaspard with a former top aide to Rahm Emanuel; replacing
deputy chief of staff Jim Messina, who is expected to move to Obama's 2012 campaign,
with Legislative Affairs Director Phil Schiliro; and possibly giving White House energy czar
Carol Browner expanded policy responsibilities.
But if Obama's critics are focusing on his agenda and messaging, many on his team are
urging him to address what they see as a major organizational flaw: an amorphous, ill-
defined chain of command in the West Wing that concentrates too much power in too few
hands, hampering efficiency, accountability and communication.
"If there's still only five, 10 people making decisions, then we haven't learned our lesson
from Tuesday," said one aide, who believes the problem starts with Obama's insistence
on giving his senior advisers, Valerie Jarrett and David Axelrod, broadly sketched
responsibilities.
But the issue isn't confined to the upper levels. Several Obama insiders pointed to a
surplus of West Wingers who spin out ideas by the bushel — and a shortage of seasoned
middle managers to execute and sell them.
"They've been here for two years; they need a more grown-up system," one former
administration official said. "They've gone too horizontal."

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771607 Date: 08/31/2015
Key Obama aides — including interim chief of staff Pete Rouse, who has been tasked with
creating a new organizational plan, and press secretary Robert Gibbs, who is seeking to
carve out a role beyond briefing reporters — have reportedly made that point directly to
the president.
But it's not clear whether Obama, who ordered Rouse to conduct an institutional review of
the West Wing, is ready to scrap a loose, comfortable system that allowed him to respond
quickly to multiple crises for a more conventional executive organization.
No one expects Obama to immediately heed calls to conduct a major housecleaning — or
inject fresh blood into the West Wing by bringing in outsiders or even a Republican or two,
as former Sen. Tom Daschle, an Obama ally, has counseled.
White House officials maintain they will make gradual changes — and hope that the arrival
of Obama's organization-building 2008 campaign manager, David Plouffe, sometime in
early 2011 will provide the West Wing with more focus.
But Ken Duberstein, former chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan, said the White
House needs to move much more quickly. "There's a window of six to nine months where
serious governing can take place before people start looking at the [2012] primaries," he
said
Mike McCurry, President Bill Clinton's former press secretary, said Tuesday's results will
usher in changes to Obama's day-to-day operations, whether he likes them or not.
"President Clinton had to submit to a lot more discipline and structure in his daily
schedule," said McCurry, who was an aide to then-Secretary of State Warren Christopher
during the Democrats' devastating two-house loss in the 1994 midterms.
We had "little calendars that had color codes on how [Clinton] was spending his time. ...
Enjoying the solitude of the office is probably over [for Obama]," he added.
Obama has had weeks to brace for the worst, unlike Clinton, who was blindsided by the
'94 results. But some of Obama's allies fear he will take Tuesday's results too much in
stride. That perception was fueled by Axelrod, who told a gathering of Democrats earlier
this week that he didn't interpret Tuesday's expected debacle as a rejection of the
president.
"I'm not sure [Obama] gets it yet," said one person close to the president.
But Rouse apparently does. In recent weeks, he has solicited advice and detailed memos
from key administration players and allies outside the White House, especially former
White House Communications Director Anita Dunn.
The results, gleaned from insiders, are a range of plans to restructure Obama's policy,
political, legislative affairs and communications operations.
No final decisions have been made. But Rouse — a quiet, meticulous organizer who
inherited a chaotic system designed on the fly by Emanuel after Emanuel left the White
House to run for mayor of Chicago — is determined to clarify lines of authority and wants
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771607 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771607 Date: 08/31/2015
to assign more specific job descriptions to senior staff.
There are no plans to embark on a wholesale purge: The structural changes, if Obama
signs off on them, are intended to dovetail with the anticipated departure of some
personnel and reshuffling of a relatively small cast of Obama insiders.
"It's a combination of two things: natural attrition and changes that want to be made,"
another aide said. But "some people have done all they can here."
And many of the biggest West Wing moves were preloaded before Nov. 2, in part to avoid
the appearance of a mass exodus — including the departures of Emanuel, Office of
Management and Budget Chief Peter Orszag (himself a critic of the White House
management structure), Council of Economic Advisers Chairwoman Christina Romer and
National Economic Council Chairman Larry Summers.
Among the first post-election moves, according to people familiar with the planning, will be
to move Gaspard, who has fallen out of favor, to another administration job or a position
outside the White House.
The top candidate to replace him is said to be veteran House Democratic staffer Sean
Sweeney, who served as Emanuel's chief of staff.
Messina, an Obama favorite who is said to be headed to Chicago next year with Axelrod
to work on Obama's reelection effort, is likely to be replaced by Schiliro, though Schiliro
won't inherit Messina's wide-ranging political portfolio.
The legislative affairs office — a pre-midterm powerhouse that pushed through the
stimulus, regulatory reform and health care bills — will most likely be downsized to reflect
Obama's curtailed agenda on the Hill.
But Schiliro, a former aide to Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.), will pick 'up a crucial new
assignment: In conjunction with White House counsel Bob Bauer, he's expected to defend
Obama against an anticipated wave of GOP hearings and investigations spearheaded by
the feared new chairman of the House Oversight Committee, California Rep. Darrell lssa.
Less clear is what Rouse and Obama have in store for the policy team — a group that
becomes much more important now that any meaningful legislative action is shut down by
House Republicans and a shrunken Senate majority.
In a flashback to the Clinton years, the administration will now be forced to rely on creative
rule writing and new regulatory strategies to counter Republican obstruction on the Hill.
Several people familiar with the situation said that Browner, one of the few Clinton
administration veterans to earn the president's trust — is being considered for a newly
envisioned policy job.
Browner, known for her aggressive rule making when she was Environmental Protection
Agency administrator, would supplant deputy chief of staff Mona Sutphen, who is
expected to leave the administration sometime in 2011.
Melody Barnes, director of Obama's Domestic Policy Council, is also expected to take on

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771607 Date: 08/31/2015
a greater role.
In the meantime, Rouse has quietly sought to change the culture inside the West Wing by
enfranchising a wider circle of advisers than did Emanuel, who was prone to making spur-
of-the-moment decisions consulting only a handful of trusted aides.
The changes are small but significant. Emanuel made many of his decisions at his
signature 7:30 a.m. meeting in the chief of staffs office — and often used a larger 8:30
a.m. sit-down simply to issue marching orders.
Rouse, by contrast, seems to put more weight on the later meeting because it gives more
junior staff an opportunity to take part in decision making, insiders say.

Lauren/Cheryl,
And--Please let Hillary know that I have invited Australian Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd to speak at Occidental
in the coming year--on China or whatever topic he pleases. His chief of staff Philip Green has responded with
some interest, and the Australian CG in LA is very excited to make it happen. Consulate here has invited me to
speak at conference in January in LA on the US and Australia in Asia, and I have accepted (a good topic too if
embassy Canberra wanted to invite me down as PD speaker). It would be helpful, if Hillary can work it in to her
informal time with Rudd to mention me and Oxy in a favorable way and encourage him to accept the invitation
to speak on our campus. I'd certainly appreciate it.
Thanks as ever,
Derek
I just saw the news reports on the program that Hillary will be doing with young Australians in Melbourne o
Sunday. Looks great. And perhaps she will get to meet my friend Glyn Davis, head of University of Melbourne
on margins of event.

health care in usa for himself, some chit w clintons in future, consideration on human rights bill, and
consideration for his successor. I am not saying that USG has to give in on these. But I am saying that USG
has to be aware that mubarek wants to solve our issue - but wants his requests to at least be acknowledged.

Subject: an SP memo on possible legal and nonlegal strategies re wikileaks
Following this morning's meetings I activated my four legal eagles on the SP staff Peter Harrell,
Jen Harris, Bill Burke White, and Catherine Powell (that includes two law profs and two Yale law
grads who certainly could be law profs). They in turn reached out to people at the Berkmann
Center at Harvard and other experts, working together with Alec Ross. Alec has been particularly
useful in terms not only of his knowledge but also his sensitivity to how anything we might try to
do could impact our own internet freedom agenda. The result is the attached memo, which has one
interesting legal approach and I think some very good suggestions about how to handle our public
diplomacy. AM

Please Pass to the Secretary
Madame Secretary,
A shoot out occurred on August 20 in front of the American School in Monterrey (AFSM), resulting in the death of two
bodyguards. An investigation is continuing into the details, but our understanding at this point is that it was an
attempted kidnapping targeting the relatives of a local business executive. While it does not appear that U.S. families
were targeted, the sharp increase in kidnapping incidents in the Monterrey area, and this event in particular, present a
very high risk to the families of U.S. citizens who might be become incidental victims.
U.S. security and law enforcement personnel have engaged local and federal security officials to seek their help on
understanding the immediate risks and measures that can be taken. I have urged U.S. families at the Consulate in
Monterrey not to send their children to school in the coming days while we review the events that took place on August
20. We also are advising U.S. citizens in the area that we have urged Consulate personnel not to send their children to
school while we complete this security review.
I am sure that the warden notice will lead to a rash of press reports on U.S. concerns about security in Monterrey. More
broadly, if the government cannot get the kidnappings in Monterrey under control, that may affect our ability to
function in Monterrey. I have advised Secretary Espinosa of this, and have sought her help as well to address consulate
security.
Consulate personnel are currently on "authorized departure" and have the option to send their families to a U.S.
location. Pat Kennedy is in close touch on these matters.

Just won't stop...
New York, NY -- September 20, 2010 — "NBC Nightly News" anchor and managing editor Brian Williams
interviewed President Jimmy Carter to discuss the release of his new book "White House Diary." The interview
airs tonight on "NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams."
BRIAN WILLIAMS: The last photo of you with your-- fellow former presidents, you were well off to the side
on the right. And I thought to myself, well, there's-- there's a possible metaphor. (LAUGHTER) What is it--
about you, you think, the way you've-- decided to conduct your life and post-presidency? Do you feel listened
to? Do you feel-- that you receive your due? Or do you feel, in fact, apart from the crowd?
JIMMY CARTER: No. I-- I feel that my role as a former president is probably superior to that of other
presidents. Primarily because of the activism and the-- and the injection of working at the Carter Center and in
international affairs, and to some degree, domestic affairs, on energy conservation, on-- on environment, and
things of that kind. We're right in the midst of the-- of the constant daily debate.
And-- and-- and the Carter Center has decided, under my leadership, to fill vacuums in the world. When-- when
the United States won't deal with troubled areas, we go there and we meet with leaders who can bring an end to
a conflict, or an end to a human rights abuse, and so forth. So I-- I feel that have an advantage over many other
former presidents in being involved in daily affairs that have shaped the policies of our nation and the world.

The US Diplomatic Leaks
A Superpower's View of the World
By SPIEGEL Staff
251,000 State Department documents, many of them secret embassy reports from around the world,
show how the US seeks to safeguard its influence around the world. It is nothing short of a political
meltdown for US foreign policy.
What does the United States really think of German Chancellor Angela Merkel? Is she a reliable ally? Did she really
make an effort to patch up relations with Washington that had been so damaged by her predecessor? At most, it was
a half-hearted one.
The tone of trans-Atlantic relations may have improved, former US Ambassador to Germany William Timken wrote in
a cable to the State Department at the end of 2006, but the chancellor "has not taken bold steps yet to improve the
substantive content of the relationship." That is not exactly high praise.
And the verdict on German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle? His thoughts "were short on substance," wrote the
current US ambassador in Berlin, Philip Murphy, in a cable. The reason, Murphy suggested, was that "Westerwelle's
command of complex foreign and security policy issues still requires deepening."

Such comments are hardly friendly. But in the eyes of the American diplomatic corps, every actor is quickly
categorized as a friend or foe. King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia? A friend: Abdullah can't stand his neighbors in Iran and,
expressing his disdain for the mullah regime, said, "there is no doubt something unstable about them." And his ally,
Sheikh bin Zayed of Abu Dhabi? Also a friend. He believes "a near term conventional war with Iran is clearly
preferable to the long term consequences of a nuclear armed Iran."
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's emissaries also learn of a special "Iran observer" in the Azerbaijan capital of Baku
who reports on a dispute that played out during a meeting of Iran's Supreme National Security Council. An enraged
Revolutionary Guard Chief of Staff Mohammed Ali Jafari allegedly got into a heated argument with Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad and slapped him in the face because the generally conservative president had, surprisingly, advocated
freedom of the press.
A Political Meltdown
Such surprises from the annals of US diplomacy will dominate the headlines in the coming days when the New York
Times, London's Guardian, Paris' Le Monde, Madrid's El Pais and SPIEGEL begin shedding light on the treasure trove of
secret documents from the State Department. Included are 243,270 diplomatic cables filed by US embassies to the
State Department and 8,017 directives that the State Department sent to its diplomatic outposts around the world. In
the coming days, the participating media will show in a series of investigative stories how America seeks to steer the
world. The development is no less than a political meltdown for American foreign policy.
Never before in history has a superpower lost control of such vast amounts of such sensitive information -- data that
can help paint a picture of the foundation upon which US foreign policy is built. Never before has the trust America's
partners have in the country been as badly shaken. Now, their own personal views and policy recommendations have
been made public -- as have America's true views of them.
For example, one can learn that German Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, the Germany's most beloved
politician according to public opinion polls, openly criticizes fellow cabinet member Guido Westerwelle in conversations
with US diplomats, and even snitches on him. Or that Secretary of State Clinton wants her ambassadors in Moscow
and Rome to inform her whether there is anything to the rumors that Italian President Silvio Berlusconi and Vladimir
Putin have private business ties in addition to their close friendship -- whispers that both have vehemently denied.
America's ambassadors can be merciless in their assessments of the countries in which they are stationed. That's their
job. Kenya? A swamp of flourishing corruption extending across the country. Fifteen high-ranking Kenyan officials are
already banned from traveling to the United States, and almost every single sentence in the embassy reports speaks
with disdain of the government of President Mwai Kibaki and Prime Minister Raila Odinga.
Weighing Public Interest against Confidentiality
Turkey hardly comes away any less scathed in the cables. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the cables allege,
governs with the help of a cabal of incompetent advisors. Ankara Embassy officials depict a country on a path to an
Islamist future -- a future that likely won't include European Union membership.
As with the close to 92,000 documents on the war in Afghanistan at the end of July and the almost 400,000
documents on the Iraq war recently released, the State Department cables have also been leaked to the WikiLeaks
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771872 Date: 08/31/2015

whistleblower platform -- and they presumably came from the same source. As before, WikiLeaks has provided the
material to media partners to review and analyze them.
With a team of more than 50 reporters and researchers, SPIEGEL has viewed, analyzed and vetted the mass of
documents. In most cases, the magazine has sought to protect the identities of the Americans' informants, unless the
person who served as the informant was senior enough to be politically relevant. In some cases, the US government
expressed security concerns and SPIEGEL accepted a number of such objections. In other cases, however, SPIEGEL
felt the public interest in reporting the news was greater than the threat to security. Throughout our research,
SPIEGEL reporters and editors weighed the public interest against the justified interest of countries in security and
confidentiality.
It is now possible to view many political developments around the world through the lens of those who participated in
those events. As such, our understanding of those events is deeply enriched. That alone is often enough to place
transparency ahead of national regulations regarding confidentiality.
Following the leaks of military secrets from Afghanistan and Iraq, these leaks now put US diplomats on the hot seat. It
is the third coup for WikiLeaks within six months, and it is one that is likely to leave Washington feeling more than a
bit exposed. Around half of the cables that have been obtained aren't classified and slightly less, 40.5 percent, as
classified as "confidential." Six percent of the reports, or 16,652 cables, are labelled as "secret;" and of those, 4,330
are so explosive that they are labelled "NOFORN," meaning access should not be made available to non-US nationals.
Taken together, the cables provide enough raw text to fill 66 years worth of weekly SPIEGEL magazines.
Gossip and the Unvarnished Truth
Much in the material was noted and sent because those compiling the reports or their dialogue partners believed, with
some certainty, that their transcripts would not be made public for the next 25 years. That may also explain why the
ambassadors and emissaries from Washington were so willing to report gossip and hearsay back to State Department
headquarters. One cable from the Moscow Embassy on Russian first lady Svetlana Medvedev, for example, states that
she is "generating tensions between the camps and remains the subject of avid gossip." It then goes on to report that
President Medvedev's wife had already drawn up a list of officials who should be made to "suffer" in their careers
because they had been disloyal to Medvedev. Another reports that the wife of Azerbaijan leader Ilham Aliyev has had
so much plastic surgery that it is possible to confuse her for one of her daughters from a distance, but that she can
barely still move her face.
What makes the documents particularly appealing, though, is that many politicians speak the unvarnished truth,
confident as they are that their musings will never be made public.
What, though, do the thousands of documents prove? Do they really show a US which has the world on a leash? Are
Washington's embassies still self-contained power centers in their host countries?
In sum, probably not. In the major crisis regions, an image emerges of a superpower that can no longer truly be
certain of its allies -- like in Pakistan, where the Americans are consumed by fear that the unstable nuclear power
could become precisely the place where terrorists obtain dangerous nuclear material.

There are similar fears in Yemen, where the US, against its better judgement, allows itself to be instrumentalized by
an unscrupulous leader. With American military aid that was intended for the fight against al-Qaida, Ali Abdullah Saleh
is now able to wage his battle against enemy tribes in the northern part of the country.
Insult to Injury
Even after the fall of Saddam Hussein, it still remained a challenge for the victorious power to assert its will on Iraq.
In Baghdad, which has seen a series of powerful US ambassadors -- men the international press often like to refer to
as American viceroys -- it is now up to Vice President Joe Biden to make repeated visits to allied Iraqi politicians in an
effort to get them to finally establish a respectable democracy. But the embassy cables make it very clear that
Obama's deputy has made little headway.
Instead, the Americans are forced to endure the endless tirades of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarek, who claims to
have always known that the Iraq war was the "biggest mistake ever committed" and who advised the Americans to
"forget about democracy in Iraq." Once the US forces depart, Mubarak said, the best way to ensure a peaceful
transition is for there to be a military coup. They are statements that add insult to injury.
On the whole, the cables from the Middle East expose the superpower's weaknesses. Washington has always viewed it
as vital to its survival to secure its share of energy reserves, but the world power is often quickly reduced to becoming
a plaything of diverse interests. And it is drawn into the animosities between Arabs and Israelis, Shiites and Sunnis,
between Islamists and secularists, between despots and kings. Often enough, the lesson of the documents that have
now been obtained, is that the Arab leaders use their friends in Washington to expand their own positions of power.
Editor's note: DER SPIEGEL's full reporting on the WikiLeaks US diplomatic cables will be published first in
the German-language edition of the magazine, which will be available on Monday to subscribers and at
newsstands in Germany and Europe. SPIEGEL ONLINE International will publish extended excerpts of
SPIEGEL's reporting in English in a series that will launch on Monday.

The United States was catapulted into a worldwide diplomatic crisis today, with the leaking to the Guardian and
other international media of more than 250,000 classified cables from its embassies, many sent as recently as
February this year.
At the start of a series of daily extracts from the US embassy cables - many of which are designated "secret" —
the Guardian can disclose that Arab leaders are privately urging an air strike on Iran and that US officials have
been instructed to spy on the UN's leadership.
These two revelations alone would be likely to reverberate around the world. But the secret dispatches which
were obtained by WikiLealcs, the whistlebowers' website, also reveal Washington's evaluation of many other
highly sensitive international issues.
These include a major shift in relations between China and North Korea, Pakistan's growing instability and
details of clandestine US efforts to combat al-Qaida in Yemen.
Among scores of other disclosures that are likely to cause uproar, the cables detail:
•Grave fears in Washington and London over the security of Pakistan's nuclear weapons programme
•Alleged links between the Russian government and organised crime.
•Devastating criticism of the UK's military operations in Afghanistan.
•Claims of inappropriate behaviour by a member of the British royal family.
The US has particularly intimate dealings with Britain, and some of the dispatches from the London embassy in
Grosvenor Square will make uncomfortable reading in Whitehall and Westminster. They range from serious
political criticisms of David Cameron to requests for specific intelligence about individual MPs.
The cache of cables contains specific allegations of corruption and against foreign leaders, as well as harsh
criticism by US embassy staff of their host governments, from tiny islands in the Caribbean to China and
Russia.

The material includes a reference to Vladimir Putin as an "alpha-dog", Hamid Karzai as being "driven by
paranoia" and Angela Merkel allegedly "avoids risk and is rarely creative". There is also a comparison between
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Adolf Hitler.
The cables name countries involved in financing terror groups, and describe a near "environmental disaster" last
year over a rogue shipment of enriched uranium. They disclose technical details of secret US-Russian nuclear
missile negotiations in Geneva, and include a profile of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who they say is
accompanied everywhere by a "voluptuous blonde" Ukrainian nurse.
The cables cover secretary of state Hillary Clinton's activities under the Obama administration, as well as
thousands of files from the George Bush presidency. Clinton personally led frantic damage limitation this
weekend as Washington prepared foreign governments for the revelations. She contacted leaders in Germany,
Saudi Arabia, the Gulf, France and Afghanistan.
US ambassadors in other capitals were instructed to brief their hosts in advance of the release of unflattering
pen-portraits or nakedly frank accounts of transactions with the US which they had thought would be kept quiet.
Washington now faces a difficult task in convincing contacts around the world that any future conversations
will remain confidential.
"We are all bracing for what may be coming and condemn WikiLeaks for the release of classified material,"
state department spokesman PJ Crowley said. "It will place lives and interests at risk. It is irresponsible."
The state department's legal adviser has written to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange and his London lawyer,
warning that the cables were obtained illegally and that publication would place at risk "the lives of countless
innocent individuals ... ongoing military operations ... and cooperation between countries".
The electronic archive of embassy dispatches from around the world was allegedly downloaded by a US soldier
earlier this year and passed to WikiLeaks. Assange made them available to the Guardian and four other
newspapers: the New York Times, Der Spiegel in Germany, Le Monde in France and El Pais in Spain. All five
plan to publish extracts from the most significant cables, but have decided neither to "dump" the entire dataset
into the public domain, nor to publish names that would endanger innocent individuals. WikiLeaks says that,
contrary to the state department's fears, it also initially intends to post only limited cable extracts, and to redact
identities.
The cables published today reveal how the US uses its embassies as part of a global espionage network, with
diplomats tasked to obtain not just information from the people they meet, but personal details, such as frequent
flyer numbers, credit card details and even DNA material.
Classified "human intelligence directives" issued in the name of Hillary Clinton or her predecessor, Condoleeza
Rice, instruct officials to gather information on military installations, weapons markings, vehicle details of
political leaders as well as iris scans, fingerprints and DNA.
The most controversial target was the leadership of the United Nations. That directive requested the
specification of telecoms and IT systems used by top UN officials and their staff and details of "private VIP
networks used for official communication, to include upgrades, security measures, passwords, personal
encryption keys"
When the Guardian put this allegation to Crowley, the state department spokesman said: "Let me assure you:
our diplomats are just that, diplomats. They do not engage in intelligence activities. They represent our country
around the world, maintain open and transparent contact with other governments as well as public and private
figures, and report home. That's what diplomats have done for hundreds of years."

The dispatches also shed light on older diplomatic issues. One cable, for example, reveals, that Nelson Mandela
was "furious" when a top adviser stopped him meeting Margaret Thatcher shortly after his release from prison
to explain why the ANC objected to her policy of "constructive engagement" with the apartheid regime. "We
understand Mandela was keen for a Thatcher meeting but that [appointments secretary Zwelakhe] Sisulu argued
successfully against it," according to the cable. It continues: "Mandela has on several occasions expressed his
eagerness for an early meeting with Thatcher to express the ANC's objections to her policy. We were
consequently surprised when the meeting didn't materialise on his mid-April visit to London and suspected that
ANC hardliners had nixed Mandela's plans."
The US embassy cables are marked "Sipdis" — secret interne protocol distribution. They were compiled as part
of a programme under which selected dispatches, considered moderately secret but suitable for sharing with
other agencies, would be automatically loaded on to secure embassy websites, and linked with the military's
Siprnet internet system.
They are classified at various levels up to "SECRET NOFORN" [no foreigners]. More than 11,000 are marked
secret, while around 9,000 of the cables are marked noforn. The embassies which sent most cables were
Ankara, Baghdad, Amman, Kuwait and Tokyo.
More than 3 million US government personnel and soldiers, many extremely junior, are cleared to have
potential access to this material, even though the cables contain the identities of foreign informants, often
sensitive contacts in dictatorial regimes. Some are marked "protect" or "strictly protect".
Last spring, 22-year-old intelligence analyst Bradley Manning was charged with leaking many of these cables,
along with a gun-camera video of an Apache helicopter crew mistakenly killing two Reuters news agency
employees in Baghdad in 2007, which was subsequently posted by WikiLealcs. Manning is facing a court
martial.
In July and October WikiLeaks also published thousands of leaked military reports from Afghanistan and Iraq.
These were made available for analysis beforehand to the Guardian, along with Der Spiegel and the New York
Times.
A former hacker, Adrian Lamo, who reported Manning to the US authorities, said the soldier had told him in
chat messages that the cables revealed "how the first world exploits the third, in detail".
He also said, according to Lamo, that Clinton "and several thousand diplomats around the world are going to
have a heart attack when they wake up one morning and find an entire repository of classified foreign policy is
available in searchable format to the public ... everywhere there's a US post ... there's a diplomatic scandal that
will be revealed".
Asked why such sensitive material was posted on a network accessible to thousands of government employees,
the state department spokesman told the Guardian: "The 9/11 attacks and their aftermath revealed gaps in intra-
governmental information sharing. Since the attacks of 9/11, the US government has taken significant steps to
facilitate information sharing. These efforts were focused on giving diplomatic, military, law enforcement and
intelligence specialists quicker and easier access to more data to more effectively do their jobs."
He added: "We have been taking aggressive action in recent weeks and months to enhance the security of our
systems and to prevent the leak of information."

Wanted to update you all on the PSA and where things stand. The Ad Council placed the PSA on Wednesday.
Overall, based on the MNR report, our estimated online audience for the PSA launch story was 5.4 million, including
stories on Yahoo Finance, Forbes, and CNN. For just over 24 hours since the MNR distribution, this is fantastic pickup
per the Ad Council.
The Ad Council will continue to push this out domestically and giving us updates on where it is. They are targeting large
sporting events like U.S Open, etc. If you would like the full report with specific stories, I can send separately however
because the file is so large I do not want to max out everyone's inboxes.

On the International side and specifically S interest in placing with Al Jazeera, the Ad Council did a slightly modified
version of the 30 sec PSA, removing the texting information on the final screen and is overnighting the tape to the State
Department today. Once we have that (timing for Tuesday), we will work with Dana and PA to have the PSA placed
accordingly where makes sense.
Larry has already said that local stations in Pakistan liked the ad and were using it/reporting on it. As he is obviously
very busy, hard to know more beyond this point. IIP has been great and the revised ad is going up on America.gov. Will
work them to see what other embassy sites, etc we can promote this with.
We will continue to work to place the ad and will have donation reports on Tuesday that hopefully will reflect monetary
upticks as well. Let me know if you have any questions. Best, Katie

Below please find statements from Kerry, Ros-Lehtinen, Hoekstra, and King.
Haven't seen anything yet from Lugar or Berman.
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry:
"The release of classified information under these circumstances is a reckless action which jeopardizes
lives by exposing raw, contemporaneous intelligence. This is not an academic exercise about freedom of
information and it is not akin to the release of the Pentagon Papers, which involved an analysis aimed at
saving American lives and exposing government deception. Instead, these sensitive cables contain candid
assessments and analysis of ongoing matters and they should remain confidential to protect the ability of
the government to conduct lawful business with the private candor that's vital to effective diplomacy."

Ros-Lehtinen Condemns Latest Wikileaks Release of Sensitive U.S. Documents
(WASHINGTON) - U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), Ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, commented today on the release of scores of sensitive documents by the Wikileaks
website. Statement by Ros-Lehtinen:
"This latest release of classified and other sensitive U.S. documents by Wikileaks is
extremely irresponsible. Those who leak and publish such information are doing great harm
to our nation, and are potentially putting American lives in danger.
"This newest batch of documents appears to contain troves of classified reports related to
our nation's conduct of diplomacy and foreign policy, including reports of critical discussions
with our allies. This is the everyday work-product of our officials all over the globe. This
critical and highly sensitive information must be managed carefully.
"It is deeply disturbing that a few individuals seem to have deemed themselves worthy of
deciding that scores of classified and sensitive material should be paraded about for our
enemies to review and use against us. These leaks come at the expense of U.S. security
and, potentially, American lives."

From Rep. Pete Hoekstra (R., Mich.) ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee:

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771905 Date: 08/31/2015
"\Nikileaks clearly is determined to undermine U.S. national security and damage our foreign relations. The
disclosure of thousands of potentially classified cables and other documents is an embarrassment to the
Obama administration and represents a critical failure by the Pentagon and intelligence community to
protect sensitive national security information.
"Once again our partners and allies are forced to question whether the United States can keep secrets,
and our diplomats around the world have been forced to scramble to try and patch-up foreign relations
strained by this illegal leak. ODNI's national counterintelligence executive must move quickly to assess the
failures in this case and to establish security protocols, including robust audit capabilities for classified
networks. Congress also should move quickly to hold hearings to ensure ODNI, the military and FBI have
the necessary counterintelligence authorities to ensure a destructive leak of this nature cannot happen
again.
"The disclosure of these documents by Wikileaks had nothing to do with transparency or whistleblowing,
as the site would claim, and everything to do with undermining American foreign policy. As the world's
number one target for spying by foreign adversaries and now clearly other hacks, the federal government
must do a better job of strengthening America's computer and cybersecurity protocols. If we do not, we
risk leaving exposed an Achilles heel that could cause irreparable damage to our global partnerships and
international standing."
###
U.S. Representative Peter T. King:
"WikiLeaks presents a clear and present danger to the national security of the United States. I strongly
urge you to work within the Administration to use every offensive capability of the U.S. government to
prevent further damaging releases by WikiLeaks."

The administration's response seems quite weak to me.
This is not like the Pentagon Papers or even the videos of the bombings, this is a wholesale capturing of the diplomatic
material of the country. No State department can operate if it can't keep its own classified cables and internal orders
confidential — Ithink this is unprecedented in history. And if this is wikileaks can get, what can the Chinese or other able
to secure?
The issues surrounding the content are significant and could have legs.
But this security breach is not a targeted breach to make a whistle blower point, it is a wholesale leak that should be
treated as putting lives in danger. For what it is worth, I think you need to order a full scale review and upgrading of the
cyber security of the state department immediately. To offer a bounty for the capture of those responsible. And as I see
you doing, take an aggressive position on Wikileaks. Just being seen as apologizing for the content is weak compared to
reacting and acting to shore up the key principles behind security and aggressively dealing with the problem directly.
For what it's worth, that's my view.

Obama hopes START treaty will pass Congress soon
(AFP) – 7 hours ago
WASHINGTON — US President Barack Obama Thursday said he hoped that a landmark nuclear weapons deal
with Russia would win Congress approval before the end of this year.
The new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) was negotiated earlier this year to replace a similar treaty
which expired at the end of December.
Obama appealed to Republicans to help approve the treaty when Congress returns on November 15, after the
party put up stiff opposition to the new deal fearing it could hamper US missile defense plans.
"This is not a traditionally Democratic or Republican issue, but, rather, an issue of American national security,"
Obama said at a cabinet meeting, two days after Republicans posted strong gains in congressional elections.
"I'm hopeful that we can get that done.., and send a strong signal to Russia that we're serious about reducing
nuclear arsenals, but also send a signal to the world that we're serious about non-proliferation," Obama said.
The new Congress takes office in January, with Republicans set to take control of the House of Representatives
and to add members to the Senate. So the next two months are known as a "lame duck" session, in which
outgoing lawmakers often shy away from major legislation.
But START was facing trouble even in the current Congress. Under the US constitution, treaties need the
approval of two-thirds of the Senate.
The START treaty -- signed by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Obama at an elaborate ceremony in
Prague in April -- restricts each nation to a maximum of 1,550 deployed warheads, a cut of about 30 percent
from a limit set in 2002.
US Defense Secretary Robert Gates echoed Obama's appeal, urging the Senate to ratify a treaty to ensure the
resumption of inspections of Russia's arsenal.
His press secretary, Geoff Morrell, told reporters that Gates "and many other former defense secretaries and
national security officials, from both parties, have frequently voiced their strong belief that this treaty is

absolutely critical to the effectiveness of our nuclear arsenal, our knowledge of Russian nuclear capabilities, and
US national security overall."
In the Senate, the treaty enjoys the support of Richard Lugar, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations
Committee, along with several former Republican secretaries of state including Henry Kissinger.
But a growing number of Republicans have voiced opposition, saying it would impede the US ability to set up
missile defenses against future potential threats such as Iran.
Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, who is expected to seek the Republican nomination to run
against Obama in 2012, has led the charge criticizing START.

Cheryl,
One sappy statement before I fly. Your involvement in the QDDR process has always been extremely helpful. Most of the
best QDDR chairs meetings were those in which you participated, due in large part to the rigor and critical thought you
brought to every issue. From the beginning of the process, your critical analysis and thoughtfulness in these meetings
made all of us think more deeply. I have been grateful for that approach many times throughout the QDDR.
We've come a long way since that first meeting in which I described this as a "capabilities review" and organizational
change exercise — all met with some frustration or blank stares. I think we've ended this phase on a great note. The
amount of positive feedback we've received and the eagerness to start implementation are great signs heading into
implementation.
You are clearly one of the hardest working people in this building and have done so much to define and implement the
Secretary's vision on so many things. So thanks for everything you've done on the QDDR and for everything else you do.
As discussed today, I'm not far away if you need anything.

Subject: CARE Policy Recommendations to Meet the MDGs
Dear Ms. Mills:
CARE is pleased that the international community will come together at the Millennium Development Goals (MDG)
Summit from Sept. 20-22, 2010, in New York, to recommit to and accelerate progress toward the achievement of the
MDGs by 2015. We also welcome the United States' Strategy for Meeting the Millennium Development Goals, "Celebrate,
Innovate and Sustain: Toward 2015 and Beyond." While we have made progress on some goals, we still have much to do
if we are going to meet these global commitments by 2015.
Attached or linked below are CARE's recommendations for meeting the Millennium Development Goals and for
strengthening the US' MDG strategy. Our recommendations include approaches and strategies proven to deliver results
specifically on MDGs 1, 3, 5 and 7. CARE's reflections on the MDGs are drawn from more than 60 years of experience
working with the poorest communities in more than 70 countries around the world. Women are at the heart of CARE's
efforts because experience shows that a woman's achievements yield dramatic benefits for her entire family and the larger
community. Promoting gender equality and women's empowerment is central to poverty reduction and the achievement
of all MDGs.
The MDG Summit provides a critical opportunity to take bold and decisive action. CARE believes that the following guiding
principles must be reflected in the outcome of the MDG Summit, in the US' MDG strategy, as well as in the US' and the
international community's implementation efforts:
• An emphasis on meeting the needs of people in extreme poverty and the most vulnerable populations;
• Promotion of gender equality, gender responsiveness, and the empowerment of women;
• Adherence to broad-based country ownership, including broad stakeholder engagement with local communities,
women's groups, and other vulnerable populations, in a whole-of-society approach to development;
• Recognition of the linkages among the eight MDGs; and
• A commitment to transparency, mutual accountability, and mechanisms to track results.
Any recommitment to the MDGs must be coupled with commitments to mobilize the necessary resources that will reach
the people who need them most. In the context of the US' development strategy, CARE also believes that USAID must be
empowered as the premier US development agency to lead these efforts, and we call on the Administration and Congress
to work together to reform and modernize US foreign assistance policies, efforts and strategies.
CARE urges bold efforts to recommit to the MDGs and ensure progress toward their achievement. The MDG Summit can
be the turning point in collective efforts to achieve the MDGs by 2015. It is critical that the global community unite around
a shared action-oriented strategy for meeting — and exceeding — these goals and begin to lay the groundwork for post-
2015.
CARE stands ready to support your efforts and looks forward to continuing valuable collaboration with the US government
and other leaders to tackle poverty worldwide. Please do not hesitate to call on us.

INTERESTING TIMES
Semi-regular thoughts on foreign affairs, politics, and books, from George Packer.
November 29, 2010
The Right to Secrecy
Posted by George Packer
What do we learn from the latest WikiLeaks dump, at least according to the Times's privileged and heavily
edited account? That the Gulf Arabs are just as nervous about Iran's nuclear program as Israel is, and they want
the U.S. to stop it. That Saudi King Abdullah doesn't think much of Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki. That Yemeni
President Saleh is happy to claim American airstrikes against Al Qaeda targets as his country's own, and that he
doesn't mind whiskey being smuggled into Yemen as long as it's the good stuff. That the Chinese government
probably hacked into Google. That Qaddafi never goes anywhere without his Ukrainian "senior nurse."
On the whole, the trove makes American diplomacy look pretty good. Obama's Iran strategy of engagement-
leading-to-isolation is shown to have succeeded. Bush—contrary to the impression left on every page of his
new memoir—had enough self-awareness about the disaster in Iraq to put the brakes on military action against
Iran. And American diplomats are capable of writing blunt, vivid, even amusing assessments of world leaders.
Berlusconi is feckless, Sarkozy thin-skinned, Mugabe a megalomaniac: the accounts seem spot-on. The faceless
corps of tight-lipped American embassy officials turn out to be an alert and discerning bunch.
Future diplomatic correspondence is going to be a lot more circumspect. The WikiLeaks dump contains (so far)
a number of minor embarrassments, a few surprises, a lot of confirmations of what we already pretty much
knew, and no scandals. It will make the work of American diplomacy harder for a long time to come.
Classification abuse will increase—more cables will be labelled "Top Secret" that should have been labelled
"Secret" or "Confidential." Exchanges between American officials and their foreign counterparts will grow less
candid and more opaque. The same with cable traffic between U.S. embassies and Washington. There is an
undeniable public interest in knowing, for example, that U.S. intelligence believes the Iranians are buying
advanced missiles from North Korea, and that Gulf Arab rulers have been privately urging American military

action against Iran. The question is, does that interest outweigh the right of U.S. officials to carry out their work
with a degree of confidentiality?
Yes—the right. Lawyers, judges, doctors, shrinks, accountants, investigators, and—not least—journalists could
not do the most basic tasks without a veil of secrecy. Why shouldn't the same be true of those professionals
who happen to be government officials? If WikiLeaks and its super-secretive, thin-skinned, megalomaniacal
leader, Julian Assange (is he also accompanied everywhere by a Ukrainian senior nurse?), were uncovering
crimes, or scandals, or systemic abuses, there would be no question about the overwhelming public interest in
these latest revelations. But the WikiLeaks dump contains no My Lais, no black sites, no Abu Ghraibs. The
documents simply show State Department officials going about their work over a period of several years. Will
we get another update in six months? Will it be worth the damage? Should no government secret remain secret?
Is diplomacy possible when official views have all the privacy of social networking? Assange's stated ambition
is to embarrass the U.S. This means that his goals and those of most journalists are not the same. WikiLeaks
doesn't trouble itself with these questions. The rest of us, journalists included, should.

FORMER PRESIDENT I NEW YORK
SECRETARY OF STATE I WASHINGTON
Speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in September, Hillary Rodham Clinton sounded a confident note:
"After years of war and uncertainty, people are wondering what the future holds, at home and abroad. So let me say
it clearly: The United States can, must, and will lead in this new century."
Ironically, two of the people most crucial to the new global century are the Clintons themselves: the ex-president and
the ex-would-be-president, the power couple now defined by their position just outside the highest reaches of power.
Except that, these days, both Clintons are more influential, and more beloved, than ever. Bill's Clinton Global
Initiative is starting to feel like a sexier, more effective competitor not just to Davos but to the United Nations itself,
bringing world leaders together to commit their resources to fighting poverty with market-based, technocratic
solutions. As of this summer, his foundation had contributed $23 million and countless man-hours to the effort to
rebuild Haiti. Polls have shown he's a better advocate for Democratic candidates than the actual president, and he
spent most of the fall stumping for woebegone Dems from Orlando to Seattle.
Meanwhile, Hillary showed up in one recent poll as the most popular political figure in the United States, an
accolade she has earned through a no-drama approach to an array of thankless tasks: brushing off Vladimir Putin's
temper tantrum to reach agreement on nuclear disarmament and Iran sanctions, promoting women's rights over the
objections of entrenched traditionalists, and launching an innovative effort to bring clean cookstoves to the world's
poorest. But what she has mainly stood for is American competence, with her Quadrennial Diplomacy and
Development Review a major, if unglamorous step toward making U.S. statesmanship a more agile beast. If this is
what Clinton nostalgia looks like, bring it on.

de Larry Palmer como Embajador designado de ese pals en Caracas, a pesar
de que las inaceptables actuaciones de Palmer hayan provocado la

otorgado de buena fe.
Es bien conocido corn° Palmer quebranto las reglas basicas de respeto al
pals que lo iba a recibir, agrediendo groseramente a las instituciones
fundamentales de la Venezuela bolivariana y haciendose indigno de las
funciones que se destinaba a desemperiar.
En repetidas oportunidades, el gobierno venezolano ha hecho del
conocimiento del gobierno de los Estados Unidos que, ante la gravedad de
las actuaciones de Palmer, nos encontramos en la imposibilidad de recibirlo
en el territorio nacional. No obstante, esta decision irrevocable sera ratificada
formalmente por la via diplomatica en el mas breve lapso.
El gobierno de la Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela considera que la
insistencia de las autoridades estadounidenses en impulsar el proceso de
ratificacion de Palmer como Embajador designado en Caracas, y su negativa
a buscar una verdadera soluciOn a este problema generado en Washington,
constituyen una nueva provocacion y una manifestacion de la hipocresia de
la elite que gobierna ese pals, en particular en su relacion con los pueblos
latinoamericanos y cariberios.

Howard-
Thank you again for your inquiry. Here is a background from our Consular Affairs Office on where this
currently stands.
The Office of Children's Issues here at State began working with Mr. Bower in August 2009 when his sons
were abducted by their mother to Egypt notwithstanding a court order from a family court in Massachusetts that
had given the father sole custody of the children. Since then, as you know, Mr. Bower has not been able to see
his children.
On August 31, 2010, Embassy Cairo conducted a welfare visit (the first) with the Bower boys at the Ministry of
Justice. The Government of Egypt played a constructive role in arranging this consular visit. As you may
know, Senator Kerry has been following this case closely and issued a statement after the visit:
"I applaud the Egyptian government's facilitation of American consular access today in Cairo for Noor
and Ramsey. I hope that this is a first step that can lead to a positive outcome. It is past time for the
children to be returned to Massachusetts where they belong. The facts are clear: the two boys were
taken illegally to Egypt by their mother more than a year ago in blatant contravention of a U.S. court
ruling that granted their father, Colin Bower, sole custody. I have conveyed my concerns over this
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772111 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772111 Date: 08/31/2015
matter to the State Department and hope that the involvement of the U.S. government will help bring
this tragedy to its rightful conclusion by reunited these boys with their father."
The Department and US Embassy's Executive Office have raised this case with high level Egyptian officials
many times.
They are actively pushing the Egyptian Government to help resolve this. Unfortunately, Egypt is not a member
of the Hague Convention on abductions, so left behind parents must depend on the local courts to do the right
thing. In 2000, Egypt has formed a "Good Intentions Subcommittee" to help mediate between parents. There
have been some good results, although it all depends on the willingness of parents to work together. We also
have an MOU with the Egyptian Government that allows for consular access. Embassy Cairo relied on the
MOU when they approached the Egyptian Good Intentions Sub-Committee for help in scheduling a welfare
visit with the Bower children. Without the intervention of that sub-committee, it's likely the Embassy would
not have been able to conduct the August 31 welfare visit with the children.
Our folks will continue working closely with Mr. Bower, our Embassy in Cairo, and with the Government of
Egypt to help find a solution that reunites Mr. Bower with his children.
Best.

Subject: Gender- Melanne's Comments on QDDR
HRC:
[Huma can you print for HRC]
Melanne is stepping through the QDDR and giving specific edits on each section to ensure the integration of gender.
In addition to that help, she shared her thoughts/concerns on the reorganization as it affects s/GWI. We already
determined from your earlier feedback that S/GWI would maintain a direct report to S (I actually always thought that
even with the reorganization of homes for many of the S offices, we still were maintaining a direct S/reporting so we are
revisiting this issue writ-large for the next draft to you. For example, we now know statutorily that S/CT legislatively is a
required S report).
That said, here is her narrative for your review for when we speak. I have embedded comments in caps in text after
each graph where relevant.
TO: Anne-Marie Slaughter
FROM: Melanne Verveer
DATE: November 4, 2010
RE: Gender Integration in the QDDR
The Secretary has declared time and time again that the empowerment of women is "at the heart of the foreign
policy of the United States." Our collective task is to realize this principle by integrating gender into the policies and
programs of the State Department and USAID in an enduring way.
We are concerned that the current draft of the QDDR falls short of this call. In the existing draft, the Office of
Global Women's Issues falls under a new Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy and Human Rights while
retaining the Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues who reports directly to the Secretary. This new structure
misses the simple but important reality that women are half of the world's population and that the major security,
economic and social challenges of this century cannot be solved without them. These issues cut across the work of the
department and touch virtually all regions, though we place special emphasis on regions in which women and girls
are most vulnerable, such as in countries experiencing conflict and transition. Locating the office within one bureau
makes it impossible for the Office to implement its very charge — to integrate gender effectively into the work of the
entire State Department.
Therefore, gender must be integrated throughout all of the regional and functional bureaus rather than located
within one bureau. Women should be integral to all of our diplomatic efforts—from traditional bilateral and multilateral
relationships, strategic dialogues, and public diplomacy, to our relations with civil society, community leaders and other
non-state actors. Women are also important to consider in all of our policy initiatives, including global health, food
security, climate change, economic issues, human rights, and peace and security. We must institute rigorous
institutional mechanisms to ensure that all bureaus, both regional and functional, consider gender in diplomacy and
development.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772152 Date: 08/31/2015
In order to integrate gender effectively throughout the work of the Department, we recommend the following
approach to planning, budgeting, structure and evaluation:
Maintain visibility and focus on gender. Retain the Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues who
reports to the Secretary. This position embodies our commitment to and advocacy for gender equality as an essential
part of diplomacy and development and signals our understanding that this is important to the national security of the
United States. In addition, the office advances a coherent and coordinated strategy on gender throughout the State
Department and USAID. [DONE]
Ensure that gender is effectively addressed throughout all bureaus and missions. We recommend the
following structural changes at State. First, make the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary (PDAS) in all regional and
functional bureaus responsible and accountable for their bureaus' work on gender. The Office of Global Women's Issues
would serve as a resource to the PDAS on these issues. Second, assign specialized gender liaisons to regional bureaus
for purposes of integration, where needed. Third, include training and capacity development for employees on gender
Issues (in both Foreign and Civil Service as well as for political appointees). Fourth, evaluate the PDAS in each bureau on
gender integration in policies and programs (including, for example, as a component in the Performance Evaluation
System). Similarly, require each Chief of Mission to be responsible and accountable for the mission's work on gender, to
assign personnel with expertise to manage the work on gender, to require personnel to receive training on gender
issues, and to be evaluated on this work. A parallel structure should be put in place at USAID, and our diplomacy and
development work on gender should be coordinated and complimentary.
[THIS IS RECOMMENDATION, WITH SOME VARIATION, MADE FOR MANY AREAS — PUBLIC DIPLOMACY,
MULTILATERAL AFFAIRS, AND OTHERS — CHALLENGE WILL BE TO IDENTIFY HOW TO ADDRESS EFFECTIVELY AND CREAT A
PDAS JOB THAT IS MEANINGFUL GIVEN THE NEW RESPONSIBILITIES SOUGHT TO BE IMPOSED THROUGH THAT
POSITION]
Include gender in strategic planning and budget allocation. We recommend continuing the requirement
initiated last year that all bureaus include a plan for gender integration in their annual Strategic Plan and Budget
proposal. Each bureau is required to describe how their policies and programs will improve gender equality and how
that will strengthen their work more generally. They are also required, to the extent possible, to outline what portion of
their policies and programs target or affect women and girls. [THIS ALREADY IS IN PLACE AND WOULD BE RETAINED]
Measure impact. Develop indicators and long-term evaluation systems to measure the impact of programs on
women and girls. There are efforts underway currently within F and at USAID to consider how to improve our
measurement of impact on women and girls and to develop different and additional indicators where
appropriate. [SAME AS IMMEDIATELY ABOVE —THIS IS ALREADY IN PROCESS]
Happy to discuss.

Cheryl,
One sappy statement before I fly. Your involvement in the QDDR process has always been extremely helpful. Most of the
best QDDR chairs meetings were those in which you participated, due in large part to the rigor and critical thought you
brought to every issue. From the beginning of the process, your critical analysis and thoughtfulness in these meetings
made all of us think more deeply. I have been grateful for that approach many times throughout the QDDR.
We've come a long way since that first meeting in which I described this as a "capabilities review" and organizational
change exercise — all met with some frustration or blank stares. I think we've ended this phase on a great note. The

amount of positive feedback we've received and the eagerness to start implementation are great signs heading into
implementation.
You are clearly one of the hardest working people in this building and have done so much to define and implement the
Secretary's vision on so many things. So thanks for everything you've done on the QDDR and for everything else you do.
As discussed today, I'm not far away if you need anything.

also said there was a brief blurb about it on the Today Show. Some of these sites are cross posted elsewhere. Most just

Morning all, wanted to update you on where we are with the PSA for Pakistan that we produced in conjunction with Ad
Council. You can view the PSAs here: http://multivu.prnewswire.com/mnr/adcouncil/45926/ - please note this is NOT
public yet.
The Ad Council is releasing the PSA @ 1pm today and we will be sending (once approved) a press release out as well
linked to state.gov where the PSA's will live. There are TV, Radio and Web versions of the PSA cut into 30 and 60 second
spots.
We still are working through some music and image questions with the Ad Council to secure international distribution.
We are waiting to hear from them on this. Once we hear, the Ad Council will make some minor edits to the PSA e.g.
removing the Text Donation information as it applies only to Americans and re-send the files with the revised transcript.
Once we have that, then we can move forward translating into local languages. The Ad Council said they will need an
additional 2 to 3 days to make edits but again I am waiting to confirm.
Hope this update is helpful. Please let me know if you have questions. Best, Katie

BELGRADE (AP) — Serbia's failure to prevent anti-gay riots could hurt its bid to join the European Union, a EU official
said. Jelko Kacin, in charge of the European Parliament's evaluation reports on Serbia, said in a statement the anti-gay
riots "show an elementary lack" of tolerance for minority rights in Serbia and the "inefficiency" of the state in preventing
such a trend. "A very bad message was sent from Belgrade" that could hurt its bid to join the EU, the Slovenian official
said. The gay pride march, was viewed as a major test for Serbia's government, which has pledged to protect human
rights as it seeks EU membership.

You have graciously facilitated a couple of meetings between me and Secretary Clinton and I need to express my thanks.
Today is my last day as the US Security Coordinator for Israel/Palestine and I would be grateful if you could pass my
appreciation for S's support these past two years. Our Ambassadors in Jordan and Israel think it would be useful for me
to give her a summary of where I see things after almost 5 years here in Jerusalem, but I do not wish to intrude.
However, should she want to chat, I will be on pre-retirement leave in the DC area until mid-November.
Thanks again for the assistance along the way.

I met with Simoes last week, and he expressed his appreciation for your willingness to meet
with him. He has a high regard for you, and sees today's meeting as evidence of our respect
for and interest in Brazil's role in Haiti.
He is in D.C. trying to get IDB funding for an energy production project in Haiti. He
expressed frustration at the slow pace of decision-making on nearly all issues
related to reconstruction and development, and also at the discrepancy within the
international community between pledged monies and actual obligation of funds.
Several other issues that you should be aware of.

Not good. I can fix all of this, and I have been working with Patriota and Simoes to keep
our conversations on a positive plane. Again, I don't think
Simoes will raise this, but you should be aware that there is friction.

Finally, regarding your trip here, the second round of the elections is all consuming. Until
the outcome of the October 31 vote is in hand, I don't think you would get done here what you
would like to accomplish. You might want to raise this with Simoes. The polls still point
to a Dilma win, but it will be a fight to the finish. Could we think about a November or
December trip?
Happy to talk about any or all of this.

STATEMENT FROM LISA MCGOVERN:
"Earlier today, Jim underwent successful surgery in Washington to remove his thyroid gland. During a
recent routine examination, we discovered a small nodule that a biopsy showed to be cancerous. This type of
thyroid cancer grows very slowly, and is successfully treatable. He's feeling good, and his prognosis is
excellent. Jim will take a few days off and is looking forward to being back at work next week for the lame-
duck session. Until then, I'll be trying to convince him to rest and stay off the phone!
"As Executive Director of the Congressional Families program at the Prevent Cancer Foundation, I
know how important early detection and treatment can be. Jim and I urge everyone to get their regular check-
ups and screenings, and to take steps to prevent cancer by making healthy lifestyle choices, which include a
good diet, exercise, not smoking and knowing your family history and risk factors. Lots of good information
can be found at www.preventcancer.org."
The following is a statement from Dr. Brian P. Monahan, the Congressional Attending Physician:
"Congressman McGovern was admitted to the Washington Hospital Center today for surgery to remove
the thyroid gland in his neck. He was discovered to have a nodule in his thyroid gland on routine health
examination. A biopsy of this nodule showed papillary cancer of the thyroid gland. He underwent today's
procedure to remove the gland from his neck as a curative therapy for his cancer. He completed the surgery
without complications and will be discharged from the hospital after a brief period of observation.
"Thyroid cancer is diagnosed in about 37,000 people in the United States each year with over 75% of
these being the papillary type. The vast majority of patients are cured with surgery and do not experience any

removed at surgery, and Congressman McGovern will take a daily thyroid medication to replace the functions
of his thyroid gland. He will return to his usual duties next week after a brief convalescence."

Issa plans hundreds of hearings
By: Jake Sherman and Richard E. Cohen
November 8, 2010 05:13 PM EST
California Rep. Darrell Issa is already eyeing a massive expansion of oversight for next
year, including hundreds of hearings; creating new subcommittees; and launching fresh
investigations into the bank bailout, the stimulus and, potentially, health care reform.
Issa told POLITICO in an interview that he wants each of his seven subcommittees to hold
"one or two hearings each week."
"I want seven hearings a week, times 40 weeks," lssa said.
Issa is also targeting some ambitious up-and-comers like Reps. Jason Chaffetz of Utah,
Patrick McHenry of North Carolina and Jim Jordan of Ohio — all aggressive partisans —
to chair some of his subcommittees.
He also wants to organize aggressive oversight beyond his committee and plans to refer
inquiries to other House panels, drawing even more incoming GOP chairmen to the cause
of investigating the executive branch.
"As Clint Eastwood says, a man needs to know his limitations," Issa said in the interview.
"With other committees, we have good working relationships. Our committees have some
areas of primary jurisdiction, including the federal work force, procurement and the Postal
Service. We will take care of our core knitting, but we have very narrow legislative
jurisdiction."
While he promises an ambitious — and some say confrontational — agenda, Issa is
making overtures to the Obama administration: He already has a meeting scheduled with
Vice President Joe Biden to discuss stimulus oversight.
But lssa's specific plans bring a certain reality to what has been known for months:
Oversight of the Obama administration and congressional Democrats will be a central

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772863 Date: 08/31/2015
purpose for the new Republican House.
To give an idea of how expansive Issa's oversight plans are, look at the record of Rep.
Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) when he chaired the oversight committee during in the 110th
Congress during George W. Bush's presidency. Waxman held 203 oversight hearings in
two years; Issa has signaled he's prepared to hold about 280 in just one year.
Issa sees the committee's role as not policy but to "measure failures." He likens his job to
seeing "whether the fuel being consumed meets the specifications." And he isn't looking to
catch witnesses off guard, saying that "oversight should be done with a balance for the
American people and not as a gotcha."
Issa won't have a shortage of targets. He's been hammering for better tracking of the
stimulus and has a growing list of other investigative targets, including the housing
meltdown and the bank bailout.
Earlier this year, Issa pressured Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman
Edolphus Towns (D-N.Y.) to issue a subpoena to Countrywide Financial about its VIP loan
program. Other investigations during the minority included inquests into actions taken
during the financial meltdown and a look at problems with Toyota automobiles.
There are already résumés piling up from people looking to join lssa's staff — mostly
lawyers, a source said. Republicans have a good deal of hiring to do in the weeks ahead,
although the House Republican Steering Committee will approve chairmen in December.
Issa will most likely face no serious challenge.
In the coming weeks, Issa and his staff are also planning to reach out to the inspector
general community and staffers at the various bureaucracies the committee will oversee.
Issa also is looking to dig into procurement and government contracting, and he seems
sure to return to the Countrywide VIP program — which has subpoenaed records en route
to the Capitol. He's also got inquiries into Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's role in the
financial collapse. And with earmarks all but gone from the Capitol, Issa will turn his fire
toward the White House and the far larger sums of cash controlled by the executive
branch at a time of huge deficits.
"We really want to study presidential earmarks and the grant-making process: How do we
take all this discretionary money and see what is necessary," Issa said. "The debate on
how to shrink the federal government is at the core of our problem of government not
doing its job."
Issa is also pointedly looking to avoid probing what he seems to view as peripheral
issues — like Waxman and former Chairman Tom Davis's foray into hearings on steroids
in baseball.
"This is important, in contrast to hearings on steroids in baseball, where I felt that it was
inherently wrong to get Roger Clemens to lie to Congress," Issa said. "The American
people really want us to shrink government."
Issa also wants to avoid the sometimes petty controversies that enmeshed Rep. Dan
Burton (R-Ind.) as committee chairman during the Clinton presidency and sometimes

made him the issue.
Another, more cosmetic change could be coming up the pipe.
"We will seriously consider a name change back to what it was," lssa said, hinting the
committee will again be named the Government Reform and Oversight Committee — "to
emphasize government reform and not oversight."

The Crossroads Nation
By DAVID BROOKS
Bill Clinton used to talk about building a bridge to the 21st century. President Obama talks about laying down a "new foundation." But
Clinton was always vague about what the land on the other side of that bridge was going to look like, and Obama is vague about what
edifice is going to go on top of that foundation.
They are vague because nobody is clear about what sort of country America is going to be in 2030 or 2050. Nobody has quite defined
America's coming economic identity.
In thinking about this question, it probably helps to start at the beginning. Five hundred years ago, agriculture was the major economic
activity. One hundred years ago, it was industrial production. Now, of course, we're living in an information age. Innovation and
creativity are the engines of economic growth.
Howard Gardner of Harvard once put together a composite picture of the extraordinarily creative person: She comes from a little place
somewhat removed from the center of power and influence. As an adolescent, she feels herself outgrowing her own small circle. She
moves to a metropolis and finds a group of people who share her passions and interests. She gets involved with a team to create
something amazing.
Then, at some point, she finds her own problem, which is related to and yet different from the problems that concern others in her
group. She breaks off and struggles and finally emerges with some new thing. She brings it back to her circle. It is tested, refined and
improved.
The main point in this composite story is that creativity is not a solitary process. It happens within networks. It happens when talented
people get together, when idea systems and mentalities merge.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772865 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772865 Date: 08/31/2015
Now imagine you are this creative person in the year 2010, 2025 or 2050. You are living in some small town in Ukraine or Kenya or
some other place, foreign or domestic. You long to break out and go to a place where people are gathering to think about the things you
are thinking about, creating the things you want to create.
If you are passionate about fashion, maybe you will go to Paris. If it's engineering, maybe it'll be Germany. But if you are passionate
about many other spheres, I suspect you'll want to be in America.
You'll want to be in the U.S. because English has become the global language. You'll want to come because American universities lead
the world in research and draw many of the best minds from all corners of the earth.
You'll want to be there because American institutions are relatively free from corruption. Intellectual property is protected. Huge
venture capital funds already exist.
Moreover, the United States is a universal nation. There are already people there with connections all over the world. A nation of
immigrants is more permeable than say, Chinese society.
You also observe that America hosts the right kind of networks — ones that are flexible and intense. Study after study suggests that
America is one of those societies with high social trust. Americans build large, efficient organizations that are not bound by the circles of
kinship and clan. Study after study finds that Americans are not hierarchical. American children are raised to challenge their parents.
American underlings are relatively free to challenge their bosses. In this country you're less likely to have to submit to authority.
From this story you can see that economic power in the 21st century is not going to look like economic power in the 20th century. The
crucial fact about the new epoch is that creativity needs hubs. Information networks need junction points. The nation that can make
itself the crossroads to the world will have tremendous economic and political power.
In 2009, Anne-Marie Slaughter, now director of policy planning at the State Department, wrote an essay for Foreign Affairs in which
she laid out the logic of this new situation: "In a networked world, the issue is no longer relative power, but centrality in an increasingly
dense global web."
Slaughter's essay was titled "America's Edge." That is apt. Americans are now in a depressed state of mind. As China and India rise,
nearly two-thirds of Americans believe their nation is in decline.
In fact, the U.S. is well situated to be the crossroads nation. It is well situated to be the center of global networks and to nurture the right
kinds of networks. Building that America means doing everything possible to thicken connections: finance research to attract scientists;
improve infrastructure to ease travel; fix immigration to funnel talent; reform taxes to attract superstars; make study abroad a rite of
passage for college students; take advantage of the millions of veterans who have served overseas.
The nation with the thickest and most expansive networks will define the age. There's no reason to be pessimistic about that.

If President Obama decides to move Hillary Clinton to the Pentagon as part of a mid-term shake-up, he can
count on some unlikely support -- from Newt Gingrich.
"She is knowledgeable, she is tough, I think that she'd be a very aggressive defender of the military in terms of
what it needs, its budgets and its concerns," Gingrich told me.
The Washington rumor mill has been talking about Clinton moving over to the Pentagon for some time -- but
the secretary of state told my colleague Cynthia McFadden that she has "made it clear that I love the job I
have."
The former speaker of the House said he was impressed with Clinton when they served together on the
Transformation Advisory Group for the Joint Forces Command.
"If she would take it she would be terrific," he told me.
"I'm not sure she would have quite as much fun," Gingrich added. "I think she probably would have an even
better time being secretary of state."

As you know, we are working with Melanne on the upcoming Commission on the Status of Women/February 2011. The
US has been asked to nominate experts to participate in interactive panels during the meeting. Specifically, experts
should focus on the link between women's education and employment, women's participation in science and
technology education and employment, women's access to and use of technology, or gender biases in scientific
knowledge production and product design. We understand that US nominees are often not selected for these panels
given needs to balance regional representations. Still, we should submit one or two names for consideration. Our
suggested nominations would be who could speak to any of the topical areas listed; Dr.
another possibility is who just left

Hillary Clinton Calls on TechWomen and Green Girls for Global Change
Friday night, I waited at the San Francisco Marriott Marquis, surrounded by Bomb Squad vehicles and black bulletproof SUVS, for
Hillary Clinton to speak to an audience of 1,400, only her third appearance in the United States since she took office as Secretary of
State in early 2009. Upon entering the room, she grinned widely and received a standing ovation, welcomed with open arms by the
loyal crowd. After a brief introduction, she cut straight to the point. The government needs innovation to solve our problems and the
world's problems. And she meant it.
I live tweeted much of the event, including a lengthy Q&A that brought up issues all over the world, starting with Afghanistan, leading to
our neighbors, Canada and Mexico. E.B. Boyd ofFastCompany described the call for tech innovators quite well in her article, and the
full transcript of the event was published on the State.gov website. So while I could regurgitate many quotes from the two hour
Commonwealth Club event again here, I won't. Instead, I'll focus on the fine points affecting women, girls and bloggers -- our
community here at BlogHer.

The world is broken in so many ways. We're reminded of it every day with photos of flooded villages, exploding cities, and starving
children. Rather than taking the "glass half empty" approach and leaving it for other people to deal with, Secretary Clinton holds onto
optimism. Slowly, over generations, she believes we can solve these problems through collaboration across governments and cultures,
paired with innovative thinking and an entrepreneurial spirit. Included in this, not just as an afterthought, comes the role of women and
girls.
It's no secret Clinton is an advocate for women's rights, but she has also become a champion of global education for all, based not only
on her personal conviction but on numerous data sources showing how educating girls can change entire communities. The State
Department understands that this is a complex undertaking. But these communities also need protection. In order to help them, Clinton
explains, we must equip their governments and their people with the knowhow and a multitude of resources and tools to continue
developing on their own. Afghanistan is only one example of this, and the mWomen global initiative puts cell phones directly in the
hands of women who need them for basic communications and commerce.
Meanwhile, in more developed regions, we can provide mentorship opportunities. That's where State's new TechWomen initiative
comes in. Implemented by the Institute of International Education and the Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology, TechWomen
will bring 38 women from Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, the West Bank and Gaza for five weeks of mentorship by leaders
in Silicon Valley companies, including Google, Twitter, HP Labs, Facebook, Symantec along with Bay Area based Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories.
TechWomen provides just one way of opening up dialogues between women on how to innovate to solve global problems. It's part of
her view on "21st Century Statecraft." The State Department has also, over the past 20 months, taken extraordinary leaps in terms of
new media, for those who haven't noticed. Just look at their website now vs. two years ago (courtesy Archive.org), view their Twitter
feed, or observe their Facebook page. They're not just giving the Gov 2.0 movement lip service; they're full partners.
Which brings me back to girls. The final question from the Q&A on Friday night was from a young girl. She asked, "I am 10 years old
and I'm worried about my future environment. What can people do to help?" Clinton's soft spot couldn't have been more obvious. She
beamed at the young girl and told her "there is a lot that you can do."
Clinton continued to explain that in her experience, "young people are much more environmentally conscious and committed to
protecting the world you're growing up in than some of us older people are." (Earlier in the Q&A, she emphasized her extreme
displeasure at the lack of strong environmental legislation coming out of the Senate.) She then provided a disclaimer that she can't
comment on politics as Secretary of State, but noted, "speaking as a private citizen, I think people running for office should be asked to
explain their positions on what they're going to do." In other words, improve transparency about what candidates plan to do for the
environment and other important issues when they're elected, and hold them accountable.
After another standing ovation, Clinton stepped off the ballroom stage and departed the hotel, along with the Secret Service, Bomb
Squad trucks and darkened motorcade. But she left behind a room full of proactive thinkers, dreamers and doers, the majority of whom
were women, who will take her words to heart and make them happen. I implore the BlogHer community to join in this worthy endeavor.

Congo's Enough Moment:
The Case for Conflict Minerals Certification and Army Reform
As a growing consumer movement demands cell phones and gadgets that are guaranteed
not to fuel atrocities in eastern Congo, there is an opportunity to end the exploitation of
Congo's people and the pillaging of its resources.
In a new report, "Congo's Enough Moment: The Case for Conflict Minerals
Certification and Army Reform,"Enough Project Co-founder John Prendergast argues
that growing international attention to Congo and widespread interest in conflict minerals
has shined a spotlight on eastern Congo, opening a significant window for policy reform.
"The new U.S. law on conflict minerals and the growing global campaign have shaken up
the supply chain, and all those that are profiting say they are willing to change," says
Prendergast. "It is time for the U.S. government and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to
help leverage the end of the war in eastern Congo through leadership on two of the issues
that will catalyze a broader solution to the cycles of violence there: minerals certification
and comprehensive army reform."

Please convey to the Secretary my most profound thanks for her contribution to the 'It Gets Better' video series.

Thank you so much for your support for this project and for how quickly you made it move. Please convey our thanks to
the Secretary for her leadership on this issue. It has truly touched our members. As you may have seen, it received wide
attention within LGBT media, youth media (MTV and VH1), and the wider media. The video has over 110,000 views on

PJ-- Senator Menendez and company are released their report on Lockerbie/Megrahi release timed for tomorrow, the

into al-Megrahi's release" to "exhaustively identify and interview sources" to determine how and why Megrahi was
released.
Looking for comment...
Im also led to believe that the British govt. inquiry promised by Cameron has in fact uncovered additional documents
showing there may have additional communcations by the Brits to the Scots about the importance of releasing
Megrahi. Im assuming that State Department has been informed about some of this and you might be able to shed some
light...

Names: Radelet from State to USAID
Posted By Josh Rogin Thursday, December 23, 2010 - 12:34 PM Share
Steve Radelet, who joined the State Department last January to be Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's top advisor on
development, is moving over to USAID to be their first ever Chief Economist.
Radelet left his post as a senior fellow the Center for Global Development to help Clinton during the development of the
Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, which was unveiled earlier this month. While at State he co-led the
QDDR task force on aid effectiveness and helped stand up the Feed the Future Initiative, a huge program that will be
transferred to USAID as part of the ODOR implementation. The Chief Economist job at USAID is new.
"The new position of Chief Economist (CE) will help establish USAID as a global leader for innovative policy analysis,
research, and implementation," read an internal USAID email about Radelet's move, obtained by The Cable. Radelet will
be part of the senior management team and report director to USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah.
According to the email, the job will have four functions:
1. Building USAID's capacity to conduct rigorous economic analysis, especially macroeconomic analysis, 2. Developing a
network of leading economic researchers and development economists, 3. Cultivating a new generation of economists
and research analysts at the Agency, and 4. Providing strategic and analytical support to USAID's work in priority
countries, and implementation of Presidential Initiatives and the Presidential Policy Directive.
Before working at CGD, Radelet was a founding co-chair of the Modernizing Foreign Assistance Network. He was Deputy
Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Africa, the Middle East, and Asia from
2000 to 2002.
Read the full job description after the jump:
Chief Economist
The new position for Chief Economist (CE) will help establish USAID as a global leader for innovative policy analysis,
research, and implementation by:
1. Building USAID's capacity to conduct rigorous economic
analysis, especially macroeconomic analysis,
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773667 Date: 08/31/2015

2. Developing a network of leading economic researchers and
development economists,
3. Cultivating a new generation of economists and research
analysts at the Agency, and
4. Providing strategic and analytical support to USAID's work in
priority countries, and implementation of Presidential Initiatives and the Presidential Policy Directive.
Structure:
The Chief Economist will work extensively across the agency with both the functional and regional bureaus.
The CE will report to the Administrator and be a member of the Senior Management Team. The CE will be part of the
Front Office and have a special assistant and administrative support.
The CE will serve in an advisory capacity to the Bureau of Policy Planning and Learning (PPL) and the Bureau for
Sustainable Economic Growth (SEG). Given the cross cutting nature of the CE's work, and the resources and capacity it
will draw upon from both PPL and SEG, the CE will need to work in close alignment with the leadership of these two
Bureaus. The CE will participate in leadership meetings at both PPL and SEG, and be actively involved in advising both
bureaus. The details of this functional relationship will require further discussion between the CE and the Assistant
Administrators for PPL and SEG.
Build USAID's capacity to conduct rigorous economic analysis
Conduct focused economic and policy analysis in support of Administrator priorities at the direction of the Administrator
and serve as an economics advisor to the Administrator Enhance USAID's abilities to evaluate and understand the cost-
effectiveness and economic impacts of projects and programs.
Working closely with SEG, build USAID's capacity to incorporate rigorous economic analysis into project design,
implementation, and evaluation.
Strengthen USAID's capacity for understanding innovative ideas from external research and analysis and best practices
from other agencies, and incorporating these ideas into USAID programs.
Strengthen the knowledge base of all USAID staff on development economics through seminars, teaching, and training.
Establish regular development economics training seminars and courses for USAID staff and other staff from the
interagency.
Develop a network of researchers and development economists
Build and sustain networks of development economists from both inside and outside of the federal government
Establish and lead an interagency group of development economists and allow for USAID to be seen as a leader for inter-
agency thinking, analysis, and debate on development issues.
Develop strong partnerships between economic units and other major donor organizations such as World Bank, IMF,
DFID, etc.
Develop a "brain trust" / advisory board consisting of the world's leading development economists. The "Brain trust"
would be a mechanism under ACFVA and would leverage outside expertise and analysis in support USAID's economic
growth agenda.
Publish thought pieces for the agency on key priority economic growth issues.
Lead, mentor and guide a network of Agency economists and researchers
Working with SEG and PPL, help cultivate a cadre of senior, mid-career and junior professional policy analysts and
researchers that combine solid analytic and research skills with practical development experience.
Provide structured mentorship, support and guidance for the 77 economists working throughout the Agency.
Mentor and train a new generation of DLI economists.
Provide critical outlet and exchange function for Agency economists with the academic/ intellectual community.

The Big (Military) Taboo
By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF
We face wrenching budget cutting in the years ahead, but there's one huge area of government
spending that Democrats and Republicans alike have so far treated as sacrosanct.
It's the military/security world, and it's time to bust that taboo. A few facts:
•The United States spends nearly as much on military power as every other country in the world
combined, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. It says that we spend
more than six times as much as the country with the next highest budget, China.
•The United States maintains troops at more than 560 bases and other sites abroad, many of them a
legacy of a world war that ended 65 years ago. Do we fear that if we pull our bases from Germany,
Russia might invade?
•The intelligence community is so vast that more people have "top secret" clearance than live in
Washington, D.C.
•The U.S. will spend more on the war in Afghanistan this year, adjusting for inflation, than we spent
on the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War, the Civil War and the
Spanish-American War combined.
This is the one area where elections scarcely matter. President Obama, a Democrat who symbolized
new directions, requested about 6 percent more for the military this year than at the peak of the Bush
administration.

"Republicans think banging the war drums wins them votes, and Democrats think if they don't chime
in, they'll lose votes," said Andrew Bacevich, an ex-military officer who now is a historian at Boston
University. He is author of a thoughtful recent book, "Washington Rules: America's Path to
Permanent War."
The costs of excessive reliance on military force are not just financial, of course, as Professor Bacevich
knows well. His son, Andrew Jr., an Army first lieutenant, was killed in Iraq in 2007.
Let me be clear: I'm a believer in a robust military, which is essential for backing up diplomacy. But
the implication is that we need a balanced tool chest of diplomatic and military tools alike. Instead, we
have a billionaire military and a pauper diplomacy. The U.S. military now has more people in its
marching bands than the State Department has in its foreign service — and that's preposterous.
What's more, if you're carrying an armload of hammers, every problem looks like a nail. The truth is
that military power often isn't very effective at solving modern problems, like a nuclear North Korea
or an Iran that is on the nuclear path. Indeed, in an age of nationalism, our military force is often
counterproductive.
After the first gulf war, the United States retained bases in Saudi Arabia on the assumption that they
would enhance American security. Instead, they appear to have provoked fundamentalists like Osama
bin Laden into attacking the U.S. In other words, hugely expensive bases undermined American
security (and we later closed them anyway). Wouldn't our money have been better spent helping
American kids get a college education?
Paradoxically, it's often people with experience in the military who lead the way in warning against
overinvestment in arms. It was President Dwight Eisenhower who gave the strongest warning: "Every
gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from
those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed." And in the Obama
administration, it is Defense Secretary Robert Gates who has argued that military spending on things
large and small can and should expect closer, harsher scrutiny; it is Secretary Gates who has argued
most eloquently for more investment in diplomacy and development aid.
American troops in Afghanistan are among the strongest advocates of investing more in schools there
because they see firsthand that education fights extremism far more effectively than bombs. And
here's the trade-off: For the cost of one American soldier in Afghanistan for one year, you could build
about 20 schools.
There are a few signs of hope in the air. The Simpson-Bowles deficit commission proposes cutting
money for armaments, along with other spending. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton unveiled a
signature project, the quadrennial diplomacy and development review, which calls for more emphasis
on aid and diplomacy in foreign policy.

"Leading through civilian power saves lives and money," Mrs. Clinton noted, and she's exactly right.
The review is a great document, but we'll see if it can be implemented — especially because House
Republicans are proposing cuts in the State Department budget.
They should remind themselves that in the 21st century, our government can protect its citizens in
many ways: financing research against disease, providing early childhood programs that reduce crime
later, boosting support for community colleges, investing in diplomacy that prevents costly wars.
As we cut budgets, let's remember that these steps would, on balance, do far more for the security of
Americans than a military base in Germany.

The Big (Military) Taboo
By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF
<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editoria Isandoped/oped/columnists/nicholasdkristof/index.html?inline=nyt-
per>
We face wrenching budget cutting in the years ahead, but there's one huge area of government spending that
Democrats and Republicans alike have so far treated as sacrosanct.
It's the military/security world, and it's time to bust that taboo. A few facts:
• The United States spends nearly as much on military power
<http://www.sipri.org/research/armaments/milex/resultoutput/trends> as every other country in the world combined,
according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. It says that we spend more than six times as much
<http://www.sipri.org/research/armaments/milex/resultoutput/trendgraphs/Top1Obubble/top1Obubble2009/image_vi
ew_fullscreen> as the country with the next highest budget, China.
• The United States maintains troops at more than 560 bases and other sites abroad, many of them a legacy of a world
war that ended 65 years ago. Do we fear that if we pull our bases from Germany, Russia might invade?
• The intelligence community is so vast that more people have "top secret" clearance than live in Washington, D.C.
• The U.S. will spend more on the war in Afghanistan this year
<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/29/opinion/29kristof.html>, adjusting for inflation, than we spent on the

Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War, the Civil War and the Spanish-American War
combined.
This is the one area where elections scarcely matter. President Obama, a Democrat who symbolized new directions,
requested about 6 percent <http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/23/us/politics/23budget.html?_r=3> more for the
military this year than at the peak of the Bush administration.
"Republicans think banging the war drums wins them votes, and Democrats think if they don't chime in, they'll lose
votes," said Andrew. Bacevich, an ex-military officer who now is a historian at Boston University. He is author of a
thoughtful recent book, "Washington Rules: America's Path to Permanent War."
The costs of excessive reliance on military force are not just financial, of course, as Professor Bacevich knows well. His
son, Andrew Jr., an Army first lieutenant, was killed in Iraq in 2007.
Let me be clear: I'm a believer in a robust military, which is essential for backing up diplomacy. But the implication is that
we need a balanced tool chest of diplomatic and military tools alike. Instead, we have a billionaire military and a pauper
diplomacy. The U.S. military now has more people in its marching bands than the State Department has in its foreign
service — and that's preposterous.
What's more, if you're carrying an armload of hammers, every problem looks like a nail. The truth is that military power
often isn't very effective at solving modern problems, like a nuclear North Korea or an Iran that is on the nuclear path.
Indeed, in an age of nationalism, our military force is often counterproductive.
After the first gulf war, the United States retained bases in Saudi Arabia on the assumption that they would enhance
American security. Instead, they appear to have provoked fundamentalists like Osama bin Laden into attacking the U.S.
In other words, hugely expensive bases undermined American security (and we later closed them anyway). Wouldn't our
money have been better spent helping American kids get a college education?
Paradoxically, it's often people with experience in the military who lead the way in warning against overinvestment in
arms. It was President Dwight Eisenhower who gave the strongest warning: "Every gun that is made, every warship
launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are
cold and are not clothed." And in the Obama administration, it is Defense Secretary Robert Gates who has argued that
military spending on things large and small can and should expect closer, harsher scrutiny; it is Secretary Gates who has
argued most eloquently for more investment in diplomacy and development aid.
American troops in Afghanistan are among the strongest advocates of investing more in schools there because they see
firsthand that education fights extremism far more effectively than bombs. And here's the trade-off: For the cost of one
American soldier in Afghanistan for one year, you could build about 20 schools.
There are a few signs of hope in the air. The Simpson-Bowles deficit commission proposes cutting money for
armaments, along with other spending. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton unveiled a signature project, the quadrennial
diplomacy and development review, which calls for more emphasis on aid and diplomacy in foreign policy.
"Leading through civilian power saves lives and money," Mrs. Clinton noted, and she's exactly right. The review is a great
document, but we'll see if it can be implemented — especially because House Republicans are proposing cuts in the
State Department budget.
They should remind themselves that in the 21st century, our government can protect its citizens in many ways: financing
research against disease, providing early childhood programs that reduce crime later, boosting support for community
colleges, investing in diplomacy that prevents costly wars.
As we cut budgets, let's remember that these steps would, on balance, do far more for the security of Americans than a
military base in Germany.

Former president Clinton on mission to rescue Democratic Party in fall
elections
By Philip Rucker
Washington Post Staff Writer
Friday, October 22, 2010; 12:01 AM
Bill Clinton is baffled. The former president's friends say he is in disbelief that in the closing weeks of the
midterm campaigns Democrats have failed to articulate a coherent message on the economy and, worse, have
allowed themselves to become "human pinatas."
So Clinton is deploying himself on a last-ditch, dawn-to-dusk sprint to rescue his beleaguered party. And as the
only president in modern times who has balanced the federal budget, he is leveraging his credibility to become
one of the most fierce defenders of President Obama's economic policies.
"To hear the Republicans tell it, from the second President Obama took his hand off the Bible taking the oath of
office, everything that happened after that was his fault," Clinton said this week at a campaign rally for Sen.
Patty Murray (D-Wash.). "I'd like to see any of you get behind a locomotive going straight downhill at 200
miles an hour and stop it in 10 seconds."
If there was any doubt that Clinton remains the Democratic Party's North Star, it has been erased over the past
few weeks as he has packed legions of supporters into basketball arenas, college quads and airport hangars. He
is the Democrats' most in-demand messenger and, unlike Obama, he is summoned everywhere - no matter how
hostile the territory.
By Election Day, Clinton will have traveled to more than 100 events, including one Thursday in Maryland,
where he appeared with Gov. Martin O'Malley.
Some Democrats are troubled that Clinton, who left office a decade ago, is a bigger draw than Obama and the
party's current leaders. "Bill Clinton is not going to live forever, and it's time for the Democratic Party to
develop other voices," said Bob Rucker, a journalism profressor, as he left a recent Clinton rally at San Jose
State University.

But even with his party out of favor, polls show Clinton is among the most popular national political figures in
the country. His newfound popularity among Republicans is a notable reversal from 16 years ago - when, two
years into his presidency, a GOP resurgence cost Democrats both chambers of Congress.
"Look, folks, I've seen this movie before, in 1994," Clinton said at the rally in Everett, Wash. "I called the
president the other day, and I said: 'Relax. They haven't said anything about you they didn't say about me. The
only reason they're being nice to me right now is because I can't run for anything any more.'"
'Keep on being mad'
Clinton's pitch is rooted in empathy and delivered off the cuff. In Everett, he laid out what he said is the
Republican argument: "I know you're angry. I know you're scared. . . . So let's make this a referendum on
everything that's bothering you about life right now - take everything that's not working right now and put Patty
Murray's face on it and make it a referendum."
"It is not a referendum. It. Is. A. Choice," he continued, pausing between each word for emphasis, "a choice
between two different sets of ideas."
Clinton exhorted the crowd to "keep on being mad. But concentrate your anger so that it clarifies your judgment
instead of clouding it. . . . The worst thing you can do right now is bring back the shovel brigade to start digging
the hole again."
No other Democrat has so consistently given voice to the mood of this year's volatile, angsty electorate. Where
other politicians speak of the housing crisis in staid terms - "Mortgages? I understand homes are underwater,"
Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) said in a debate last week - Clinton talks about bad mortgages
as if his family were shackled with one.
"More than 10 million of us are living in houses not worth as much as our mortgages, and we can't move like
we used to do because our credit would be toast for a decade," Clinton said at a stop in Espanola, N.M., never
betraying that he is a millionaire many times over and the owner of multiple properties.
Clinton connects with "how normal 'walking-around' folks are feeling," said Paul Begala, a confidant and
former top strategist. "Both the right and the left have mocked that I-feel-your-pain empathy, but Americans
have always liked it. It's the core of him, even more than the brain. It's real."
Over the past two weeks, Clinton has had one day off, Saturday, which he spent in Northern California with his
close friend Terry McAuliffe. The two stayed up late, playing cards and drafting new talking points for
Democrats to trot out on the trail.
"He literally sat down with a yellow legal pad," said McAuliffe, a former chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, adding that Clinton told him: "Make sure, Terry, you get these talking points out to every
candidate."
It was then, McAuliffe said, that Clinton confided that he has been frustrated with the Democrats' message.
"He is just baffled and bewildered about why there has not been a more coherent message talking about what
the party has done, why we allowed ourselves to become human pinatas," McAuliffe said. "I think he is agitated
that Democrats haven't put their best foot forward in explaining to the American public what they've actually
done."
Student-loan policy

Clinton reserves time near the end of his speeches to talk about student-loan policy change, an Obama
accomplishment he says isn't getting its due on the campaign trail. Clinton bemoans that the United States has
fallen from first to ninth in the world in the percentage of adults with a four-year college degree - because too
many students drop out for fear that they can't repay their loans.
Democrats overhauled student-loan policy to cap monthly repayments at 10 percent of discretionary income - a
law Clinton says Republicans want to repeal.
"Do you know how many working families there are where people go home at night now, men and women and
the children they love better than life, and they're sick with worry, they think they'll never be able to send their
kids to college?" Clinton said in Everett.
"Oh, yes, you will," Clinton continued. "Do not let this bill be repealed. If the young people of America show
up, we will vote for the future and the bill will be secured. That's why you've got to vote for Patty Murray.
These are real choices here - real, serious choices."
Clinton, taking time off from running his global charitable foundation, is in the midst of a two-week swing that
has taken him from the Mississippi Delta to the Pacific Northwest and seemingly everywhere in between. It
took him across California, where he put a rivalries aside to join hands with Jerry Brown, running to reclaim his
old job as governor. Aides said Clinton might return to the road next week to visit the battlegrounds of Ohio,
Pennsylvania and Kentucky.
Some assume Democratic leaders in Washington are orchestrating Clinton's campaign activities, but he is
deployed by no one but himself.
Democratic candidates of all stripes are funneling requests and seeking advice through his top aide, Douglas
Band. Clinton prioritizes politicians who helped his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, in her 2008 presidential
campaign. (As secretary of state, she is banned from political activity.) He also has paid special care to loyal
friends such as Rep. Kendrick B. Meek (D-Fla.), who, despite running a distant third in his Senate race, has
drawn Clinton for more than a half-dozen visits, most recently this week.
The White House and congressional leaders do not coach him on what to say. Clinton does not read from a
prompter and only rarely refers to his notes at the lectern. He gives no interviews with local or national reporters
and on most days races in his motorcade from airport to rally to airport again.
Clinton speaks infrequently with the candidates - in some cases not at all before showing up for an event.
Clinton always has been a voracious consumer of news, especially political news, and aides say he stays up to
speed on their races.
This is evident in his speeches. He devotes a substantial portion to the local issues defining specific races. In
Washington state, he mused repeatedly about a Boeing tanker deal. In New Mexico, he riffed at length about
water use and encroachment from neighboring Texas.
At each stop, Clinton waxes nostalgic, as if he were revisiting an old haunt. At San Jose State: "In 1992, when I
ran for president the first time, the best rally we had in all of California was here at San Jose State." In New
Mexico: "When you voted for me twice, I got to know this state and know its people, and know the unique heart
and soul and dreams, and know the way you accommodate all this diversity and build a common sense of
humanity here. It means something to me. You're special to America."
After every speech, he flings off his suit jacket and works the crowd. He wraps his arms around folks and listens
for cues about what ails America. Clinton's speeches are bookended by thumping tunes - a Motown classic in
Everett, a Kanye West hit at San Jose State's arena, a mariachi folk song in Espanola.

"I keep thinking I'm too old for this," Clinton quipped to a crowd of 5,000 as the sun set behind him over the
open-air Plaza de Espanola at a rally for New Mexico gubernatorial candidate Diane Denish.
"No! No! No!" the crowd cried out.
"Then I got out here and started stirring around and realized a lot of people were mad and even more confused,
and I didn't want it on my conscience," Clinton said. "So I sort of loaded up and started strolling around."

Subject: 1st known case of a successful social media campaign in Syria
When Jared and I went to Syria, it was because we knew that Syrian society was growing increasingly young (population
will double in 17 years) and digital and that this was going to create disruptions in society that we could potential
harness for our purposes.
In what is the 1st of what I predict will be many interesting cases in the future, this past week a campaign went viral on
Facebook in Syria (even though Facebook is outlawed in Syria it is widely accessed through proxies) showing teachers in
Syria abusing their pupils. Thousands of Syrians made public their support on Facebook (the fact that people made their
identities known is notable) for the campaign to remove these teachers, and the Ministry of Education intervened and
fired the teachers.
This is the first known case of a successful social media campaign in Syria.
More will come.

S.O.S. -- Showing Our Strength
The United States Congress did more these past few weeks than simply pass a tax cut and rid the military of don't ask,
don't tell. It showed the rest of the world that the United States can act decisively. In uncertain times, with multiple
countries seemingly intent on testing Washington's resolve, that may prove to be the lame-duck Congress' most
important contribution to America's future.
China is one case in point. In several recent meetings with Chinese officials and opinion leaders in Beijing and
Washington, it has been apparent that many see China as on the rise and America in decline. The economic crisis, our
recent raucous election culminating with the Democrats' loss of the House of Representatives, the emergence of the Tea
Party and the American public's loss of faith in institutions, have convinced many Chinese that both our economic and
political model have failed.
But passage of the tax bill; the reaffirmation of America's commitment to human rights with repeal of don't ask don't
tell; and approval of the START Treaty, a crucial national security objective, resoundingly demonstrate that our political
process works and that we are getting our own house in order.
The challenge for the incoming Congress in 2011 is to ensure that we stay on this 'can do' path, demonstrating that the
U.S. political and economic system is alive and well. Combined with our enduring military strength, China and others will
take notice, improving our ability to manage a range of international issues, from North Korea to Iran to climate change.
To ensure the world gets the message, President Obama and the Congress need to take swift action on:

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774092 Date: 08/31/2015
Tax reform, deficit reduction and American competitiveness: The president is reviewing tax reform proposals and the
work of the several deficit commissions and study groups. Early in the next Congress, he should send to Capitol Hill a
comprehensive tax and deficit reduction package. Such reform is needed in its own right. But politically the president
must also demonstrate leadership by placing a set of proposals on the table and letting the new Republican-led House
grapple with it and take responsibility for walking their talk. This package should be part of a broader effort to promote
American competitiveness in the global economy through a fair exchange rate, a cut in the corporate tax rate, and
support for American manufacturing. A comprehensive initiative will also signal to those who doubt America's resolve
that we are serious about deficit reduction and modernizing our economy.
Energy and innovation initiatives: With Cancun having taken but a small step toward a global climate agreement, the
Congress should be challenged to do better. Even if 'cap and trade' has no immediate future, there are a host of
incentives and programmatic ideas that will increase energy research and development, spur innovation and move us
into a green, technologically sophisticated future. Our economic future depends on high-tech jobs, energy sufficiency
and nanotechnology.
Trade agreements: Passage of key trade agreements, beginning with the Korea-US Free Trade Agreement and
strengthened Colombia and Panama agreements, will signal that the U.S. is a robust import and export market and
reassert our presence in the march of globalization. No other country is idly waiting while the U.S. sorts through our own
politics. The European Union has finalized an agreement with Korea and is negotiating agreements with India and
Canada. We should, of course, only affirm free trade agreements that are in our interest, but Americans understandable
anxiety about loss of jobs cannot stall our progress when, in fact, some of the best jobs will be created by opening new
markets for our products.
Arms Control and Non-Proliferation: President Obama has laid out a vision for a nuclear free world that sets a
framework for American leadership. But dealing with Iran, North Korea and other would be nuclear weapons powers
requires all members of the U.N. Security Council. Indeed, the president should consider an arms control and non-
proliferation dialogue on a bilateral basis with all appropriate and key players, including China.
Immigration reform: Immigration reform, beginning with passage of the Dream Act, is critical for reaffirming America's
global leadership. A steady influx of immigrants has always been a source of wealth creation in the United States.
Although Americans understandably want to ensure security of our borders and a managed influx of immigrants, our
immigration policies hobble rather than enhance our economic future.
Young people brought to the U.S. by their parents deserve a pathway to good citizenship if they are willing to serve in
our military or get a college education that will serve America's objectives. How we treat immigrants says much about
our values, our openness, and our commitment to doing what is right, a set of values that we should emphasize and
celebrate.
Only by being all that America can be can we demonstrate to the rest of the world that America is not only not in
decline, but rather resilient and strong. Of course we should keep pressing others on the issues of key concern to us
including modernizing economies, resetting currencies, enforcing sanctions on Iran and North Korea, and doing their
part on climate change among other high priority issues. But America has always led by example on the global stage. The
Congress and the president took a lame duck session and showed that we weren't so lame after all. Now it's time for the
incoming Congress to do the same and show the world America's strength.

I don't know what motivated the robber here, but we are safely far behind in the masked robbery department. By my
quick research, former President Nixon masks lead the way (perhaps not surprisingly) with 11 reported instances,
followed by masks of the second President Bush (5 reported instances), and those of President Reagan (3). We appear
to be the first Democrat, however.
One other rational response to the Burton elevation occurs to me: strong alcoholic drink!

Masked 'Hillary Clinton' robs Va. bank
By Elizabeth Flock
A gun-toting man in a Halloween-style mask robbed a Sterling bank on Dec. 27, authorities said.
It appeared that the man wore a Hillary Clinton mask,
<http://www.loudou ntimes.com/index.php/news/a rticle/ma n_posing_as_u.s._secreta ry_of_state_robs_sterling_ba n k_

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774155 Date: 08/31/2015
Shortly after 9 a.m., the man walked into the Wachovia bank in Community Plaza, approached a teller, brandished a
firearm, and demanded cash, according to Loudoun County sheriff's office reports.
The robber, who authorities described as a black male around 6 feet tall, then fled in an unknown direction with an
undisclosed amount of cash. He was seen wearing a black jacket with a red shirt underneath.
No injuries were reported, says Kraig Troxell, spokesman for the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office, which distributed a
surveillance image from the robbery.
This robbery is not the first for the Wachovia bank in Sterling's Community Plaza this year. On Nov. 20, authorities said
the bank was robbed at gunpoint by Benjamin L. Sebastian
<http://www.loudountimes.com/index.php/news/article/police_name_west_virginia_man_as_suspect_in_regional_ban

Sebastian was arrested Dec. 11 and charged with six regional bank robberies
<http://www.loudountimes.com/index.php/news/article/police_name_west_virginia_man_as_suspect_in_regional_ban
k_robberies480/> , including the Sterling Wachovia bank and an Oct. 6 armed robbery
<http://sterling.wusa9.com/content/west-virginia-man-charged-connection-two-sterling-bank-robberies> of the Bank
of America in Sterling's Regal Plaza.
He remains in police custody.

Newsweek's Ben Adler: "Why is Bill Clinton So Much More Popular Than Barack Obama?" Here's a fun fact from the
latest NBC/Wall Street Journal
poll: Bill Clinton is the most popular political figure in the country.
The former president, who never won an outright majority of the popular vote and was impeached by Congress, enjoys
a 55-23 favorable/unfavorable rating. Clinton left office with an approval rating of 68 percent according to the CBS poll
at the time, so his continuing popularity is not surprising. LINK

Haiti Still Waiting For Pledged U.S. Aid
JONATHAN M. KATZ and MARTHA MENDOZA I 09/29/10 02:54 AM I 4'
Members of NGO Goal work in the Port-au-Prince streets on September 11, 2010. An United Nations report on the
impoverished Caribbean state, where a magnitude 7.0 earthquake on January 12 killed 250,000 people, said criminal
gangs are increasing their grip on many of the 1,300 camps where most of the estimated 1.3 million homeless are still
based. It painted a desolate picture of Haiti's infrastructure, estimating that almost a quarter of the 230,000 buildings
damaged, including about 150,000 hou
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Nearly nine months after the earthquake, more than a million Haitians still live on
the streets between piles of rubble. One reason: Not a cent of the $1.15 billion the U.S. promised for rebuilding
has arrived.
The money was pledged by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton in March for use this year in rebuilding.
The U.S. has already spent more than $1.1 billion on post-quake relief, but without long-term funds, the
reconstruction of the wrecked capital cannot begin.
With just a week to go before fiscal 2010 ends, the money is still tied up in Washington. At fault: bureaucracy,
disorganization and a lack of urgency, The Associated Press learned in interviews with officials in the State
Department, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the White House and the U.N. Office of the Special
Envoy. One senator has held up a key authorization bill because of a $5 million provision he says will be
wasteful.
Meanwhile, deaths in Port-au-Prince are mounting, as quake survivors scramble to live without shelter or food.

"There are truly lives at stake, and the idea that folks are spending more time finger-pointing than getting this
solved is almost unbelievable," said John Simon, a former U.S. ambassador to the African Union who is now
with the Center for Global Development, a Washington think tank.
Nor is Haiti getting much from other donors. Some 50 other nations and organizations pledged a total of $8.75
billion for reconstruction, but just $686 million of that has reached Haiti so far — less than 15 percent of the total
promised for 2010-11.
The lack of funds has all but halted reconstruction work by CHF International, the primary U.S.-funded group
assigned to remove rubble and build temporary shelters. Just 2 percent of rubble has been cleared and 13,000
temporary shelters have been built — less than 10 percent of the number planned.
The Maryland-based agency is asking the U.S. government for $16.5 million to remove more than 21 million
cubic feet (600,000 cubic meters) of additional rubble and build 4,000 more temporary houses out of wood and
metal.
"It's just a matter of one phone call and the trucks are out again. We have contractors ready to continue
removing rubble. ... We have local suppliers and international suppliers ready to ship the amount of wood and
construction materials we need," said CHF country director Alberto Wilde. "It's just a matter of money."

Last week the inaction bore tragic results. On Friday an isolated storm destroyed an estimated 8,000 tarps, tents
and shacks in the capital and killed at least six people, including two children. And the threat of violence looms
as landowners threaten entire camps with forced eviction.
In Washington there is confusion about the money. At a July hearing, Ravij Shah, director of the U.S. Agency
for International Development, thanked members of Congress for approving the funds, saying, "The resources
are flowing and are being spent in country."
It wasn't true then, and still hasn't happened.
When the earthquake hit, U.S. agencies sent troops, rescuers, aid workers and supplies to the devastated capital,
Port-au-Prince. On March 24, President Barack Obama asked Congress for $2.8 billion in emergency aid to
Haiti — about half to pay back money already spent by USAID, the Defense Department and others. An
additional $212 million was to write off debt.
The heart of the request was $1.15 billion in new reconstruction funds.
A week later, Clinton touted that figure in front of representatives of 50 nations at the U.N. secretariat, the
president of Haiti at her side.
"If the effort to rebuild is slow or insufficient, if it is marked by conflict, lack of coordination or lack of
transparency, then the challenges that have plagued Haiti for years could erupt with regional and global
consequences," Clinton said.
That was nearly six months ago. It took until May for the Senate to pass a supplemental request for the Haiti
funds and until July for the House to do the same. The votes made $917 million available but did not dictate
how or when to spend it. Without that final step, the money remains in the U.S. Treasury.
Then came summer recess, emergencies in Pakistan and elsewhere, and the distractions of election politics.

Now the authorization bill that would direct how the aid is delivered remains sidelined by a senator who
anonymously pulled it for further study. Through calls to dozens of senators' offices, the AP learned it was Sen.
Tom Coburn, a Republican from Oklahoma.
"He is holding the bill because it includes an unnecessary senior Haiti coordinator when we already have one"
in U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Merten, Coburn spokeswoman Becky Bernhardt said.
The bill proposes a new coordinator in Washington who would not oversee U.S. aid but would work with the
USAID administrator in Washington to develop a rebuilding strategy. The position would cost $1 million a year
for five years, including salaries and expenses for a staff of up to seven people.
With the bill on hold, the State Department is trying to move the money along by avoiding Congress as much as
possible. It sent lawmakers a "spending plan" on Sept. 20 and gave legislators 15 days to review it. If they fail
to act on the plan, the money could be released as soon as specific projects get the OK.
"We need to make sure that the needs of the Haitian people are not sacrificed to procedural and bureaucratic
impediments," Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman John Kerry told the AP by e-mail. "As we
approach nine months since the earthquake, further delays on any side are unacceptable."
Asked when the money will actually come, State Department spokesman Charles Luoma-Overstreet said the
department expects to start spending in the coming weeks and months. He added that $275 million in "bridge"
funds were released in March and have gone toward agriculture, work, health and shelter programs — not long-
term reconstruction.
Haitian advocates say that is not enough.
Jean-Claude Bajeux of the Ecumenical Center for Human Rights in Port-au-Prince said this phase was supposed
to be about building semi-permanent houses.
"Where are they? We haven't seen them," he said. "There is not much money that is being used. There is not
much work that has actually been done."
Of course there is no guarantee that the money would lead to the successful rebuilding of Haiti. Many past U.S.
aid efforts have fallen short.
"I don't think (the money) will make any difference," said Haitian human rights advocate Pierre Esperance.
"Haitian people are not really involved in this process."
But officials agree the funds could pay for new approaches to make Haiti more sustainable, and rebuilding
projects could improve millions of lives.
The AP found that $874 million of the funds pledged by other countries at the donors conference was money
already promised to Haiti for work or aid before the quake. An additional $1.13 million wasn't ever going to be
sent; it was debt relief. And $184 million was in loans to Haiti's government, not aid.
The Office of the Special Envoy has been tracking the money delivered so far but does not know who got it.
The envoy himself, former President Bill Clinton, told the AP in July and again in August that he was putting
pressure on donors to meet their pledges.

On the streets of Haiti, many simply feel abandoned. Mishna Gregoire, 22, said she was happy when she heard
about the donors conference. But six months later she is still in a tarp city with 5,000 other people, on a foul-
smelling plaza in the Port-au-Prince suburb of Petionville.
"I thought it was something serious they were really going to do," Gregoire said, standing amid tarps torn apart
by the sudden storm. "But nothing has been done. And I don't think anything will be done."

Dear Ms. Mills—
Since the chain of events that led to the Secretary's speaking at the Vietnam conference started with my 15
March 2010 email to you about Brownie Ledbetter's illness, I thought I would close the circle with another
email to you asking if you would pass this letter of appreciation to the Secretary. I wanted to go on record
saying how much we in the Historian's Office, and how very much I personally, appreciated both her presence
and her remarks at the conference.
Best,

Dear Secretary Clinton:
Thanks so much for delivering the opening speech at the Historian's Office's Conference on the American
Experience in Southeast Asia. It was eloquent and affecting. Your speech welcoming the audience struck the
perfect note for (1) celebrating the achievement of the Historian's Office documentary histories on
Indochina/Vietnam and (2) using that event to explore the history of United States policy in Southeast Asia,
1946-1975. It also placed in context what we were about to do at the conference. We couldn't have found a
better way to kick off our two days of historical exploration than your speech. You gave us marching orders to
study the conflict in Vietnam and the American role in it but not to let that past blind us to the common ground
our two countries now occupy. And that's what we tried to do.
The conference itself was very successful. We have had good feedback from attendees and from participants.
The speeches of Dr. Kissinger, Deputy Secretary Negroponte, and Ambassador Holbrooke, sent out ripples of
stimulating and provocative discussion, while the scholarly papers presented by American and international
scholars not only placed their comments in historical context but also, and more generally, increased our

knowledge and understanding of conflict in Indochina. The official historians from Vietnam fulfilled one of my
first requirements—that we provide our former enemy's perspective during the conference. And the media
panel—with old Vietnam hands such as William Beecher, Edith Lederer, Marvin Kalb, Morley Safer, and Barry
Zorthian on it—added zip to the proceedings as well as substance to our understanding of the media role in this
conflict. (We put the media panel video on our website Friday, accompanied by a transcript.)
In addition to the preceding I also wanted to tell you how pleased I was to have had the opportunity to briefly
chat with you immediately before your speech, and last March, too, after I gave you the sad news about
Brownie Ledbetter. Throughout that March conversation I was also having an intense debate with myself over
whether I should or should not ask you about opening the conference. I glad I did and glad that you said yes.
I also wish to tell you (no surprise here, I'm sure) how well you are served by the likes of Lona Valmoro and
Lauren Jiloty. Over the spring and summer Lona gave advice and reassurance in a number of emails when I was
structuring what I hoped you would do for and at the conference. She went out of her way to be helpful and
positive. And Lauren, as the conference drew near, gave me the sort of precise guidance, and in an always
friendly and efficient manner, about your speech and the surrounding scenario that lowered my anxiety level
considerably. I am grateful to both of them.
Finally, as I head toward retirement in February, I wanted to tell you that we in the Historian's Office—and none
more than I--see you as a first-rate Secretary of State doing an outstanding job in, to say the least, challenging
circumstances. I am personally proud to have been in the Department and served while you were Secretary.
Again, the speech was great. Thanks for doing it.
Sincerely,

You r doing a great job — if you weren't pushing...I could not imagine where things would still be with the IDB.
It will still be slower and more painful than all of us would like (but that is the nature of these processes as we know),
but things had no focus that I could see until you got involved and I think we might have lost the belief that it could work
without your determination.
Really — you are doing a great job and I admire and respect your efforts and don't know how you find the energy given
I'm sure all of the other demands you must deal with. You are making a difference here and that is what it is all about.
Please don't bother replying again Cheryl — I know how busy you must be.
Just keep going!

Subject: Update on North Park Meeting with President Preval and Request for Call on Tuesday - 2 Nov - 7am
All
I just wanted to give a quick update on the productive meeting we had with President Preval and his team of advisers
yesterday, including Gabriel Verret, to discuss a number of critical issues to move the project in the North forward.
The GOH has identified site 15 as the preferred site with which to move forward. This decision is based on the incoming
analysis from the IDB on flood risk & drainage, as well as soil and water studies. These studies point to better soil quality
and drainage on site 15 as compared to 14. Importantly, the analysis did not point to any flood risks.
The site decision enables the IDB to immediately move forward with the in depth environmental and social analysis,
which includes a water systems assessment to shed further light on quantities and quality available. President Preval
Identified site 14 as the back-up site should the assessments point to any unforeseen risks to the development of a
viable park in this location.
I think it makes sense to undertake a call on early Tuesday morning to review the status of the project, address
outstanding issues, and get an update on this week's conference. I have again attached the overall timeline of the
project and note that a number of deliverables are lagging and require greater attention to meet the agreed target of
beginning construction in January 2011.
I would suggest a call at 7am Tuesday morning given our multiple time zones. I have copied Joanne and would be
grateful if you could RSVP as to the availability of the appropriate representatives from your team to participate at this
time. Thanks so much.

Pinstripes to cargo pants -- Clinton tailors new
vision for diplomacy
By Elise Labatt, CNN
October 27, 2010 12:51 p.m. EDT
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
• It is the first-ever undertaking for the State Department
• Approach will focus on American leadership through civilian power
• Going forward, diplomats likely to wear cargo pants as a pinstriped suit.
Washington (CNN) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is outlining how she plans to redefine U.S. diplomacy and
development ahead of a top-down review which has taken place this year and will be released in the coming weeks.
In an essay in the November/December issue of Foreign Affairs, Clinton previews the Quadrennial Diplomacy and
Development Review, commonly referred to as the QDDR. The review, the first-ever such an undertaking for the
State Department, is meant to balance a similar quadrennial review by the Defense Department that projects their
strategy and priorities.
The new approach to development, Clinton says, will focus on American leadership through civilian power. Both
Clinton and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and have talked about "demilitarizing" foreign policy, and Clinton
says the QDDR will suggest how to do that, with a whole new set of resources for diplomacy and development,
much of which will be geared toward fragile states in conflict or crisis.
In the article, Clinton painted the broad strokes of the document, which she called a blueprint for reforms to be
implemented over the next four years. Those reforms include modernizing and coordinating diplomacy across U.S.
government agencies, creating a stronger nexus between diplomacy and development and ensuring that
development undertaken by the U.S. has a lasting and "sustainable" impact.
"Economic growth is the surest route out of poverty, and expanding and strengthening middle classes around the
world will be key to creating the just and sustainable international order that lies at the heart of the United States'
national security strategy," Clinton wrote in Foreign Affairs. She said that the U.S. ultimate goal in development was
to "put itself out of business" by boosting up countries to assume responsibility for their own projects and future.
President Barack Obama laid out the vision and the basic pillars of the policy in September at the United Nations
General Assembly when he released the "U.S. Global Development Policy," which changes U.S. efforts to focus on
building up countries that demonstrate good governance and economic potential.
But the QDDR will outline how to put that policy into practice. Officials say the 150-page document will detail
everything from how the United States conducts multilateral diplomacy, how the United States undertakes
"stabilization" efforts in post-conflict areas, how the State Department works with USAID and contractors to the
types and numbers of personnel needed to implement the new approach.

Obama denies batch of pardons
By: Josh Gerstein
October 28, 2010 04:37 AM EDT
After months of pleas from those who favor more use of the president's pardon power,
President Barack Obama has finally acted on the issue—disappointing many of those
advocates by denying hundreds of requests for sentence commutations and dozens of
criminal pardons.
White House and Justice Department officials confirmed that Obama has yet to grant any
pardons or commutations since taking office. Earlier this month, officials said, Obama
formally denied 605 commutation petitions and 71 pardon requests, a record that criminal
justice reform advocates find troubling.
"We'd like to see him being a lot more generous and actively granting clemency, but it
doesn't seem to be a high priority of this administration at all," said Molly Gill of Families
Against Mandatory Minimums, an organization advocating the elimination of harsh federal
punishment for certain low-level crimes. "Obviously, there are a lot of political decisions
that go into clemency decisions, particularly in an election year."
According to Pardon Power, a blog that tracks clemency issues, Obama is currently the
fourth-slowest president to commute or void a prisoner's sentence. Only Presidents Bill
Clinton, George W. Bush and George Washington have taken longer, according to P.S.
Ruckman of Rock Valley College in Illinois.
However, Obama's "about 30 days from passing Clinton" to become third slowest,
Ruckman said, though he added that details on Washington's grants of clemency are
murky.
Neither the White House nor the Justice Department would release the list of those denied
clemency by Obama this month.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775487 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775487 Date: 08/31/2015
Last month, the Justice Department argued in federal appeals court that the government
has the right to keep secret the names of those refused pardons or commutations. A
former Washington Post reporter, George Lardner Jr., sought the names for a book he's
writing on executive clemency.
Ohio State University professor Doug Berman, a clemency advocate, said he believes
Obama will soon grant pardons and commutations, which traditionally come during the
holiday season.
"Kudos to the president for acting, because simply not acting and giving the impression
this is going into some black box is actually worse," Berman said. "Wishfully thinking, I
would hypothesize that this is a precursor to some future grants. ... Obama has been
disappointing so far in that he has sent signals he's going to do nothing or, as of now,
deny, but I'm cautiously hopeful."
Margaret Love, a former Justice Department pardon attorney under Clinton and President
George H.W. Bush, said she'd like to see Obama grant pardons to some immigrants who
have long completed their sentences or never served time but now face deportation
because of criminal convictions still on their records.
"It would be wonderful to see President Obama take some action in some of the cases I
know are pending where people are under the threat of deportation," said Love, including
Chibueze Okorie, a Nigerian who is a Presbyterian minister in Brooklyn, N.Y.
In 1989, he pleaded guilty in federal court to driving a van for a heroin gang and was
sentenced to 18 months in prison. Since his release, his community work has been
praised by officials, including former Sen. Hillary Clinton, now Obama's secretary of state.
But under a 1996 law, Okorie might be forced to leave the country because he was
convicted of an aggravated felony.
In May, Democratic Gov. David Paterson of New York set up a commission to deal with
cases of green card holders who were convicted before the 1996 law kicked in or who
pleaded guilty without realizing deportation was an option.
"Congress set up this list of aggravated felonies. This was a conscious decision," said Ira
Mehlman of the Federation for American Immigration Reform. "This is something that
ought to be addressed in the legislature, not done by the president or Gov. Paterson
exercising their executive clemency privileges."
CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story said Obama has denied all pending pardon
requests. While he has yet to grant any such requests, several hundred applications
remain pending, according to Justice Department statistics.

Makes me miss my old ambassadorial days working with State.
As you can see by the below email to me, husband David Dunn (a lawyer/not lobbiest at Patton Boggs, and an old friend
of Hillary's) and another Hillary friend, Herb Miller, will be on Hainan Island on Sat. and Sun. Oct 30 and 31 (already Sat.
morning there now) to go to the city of Sanya to visit the Mayor. They are there to commit to a major commercial mall
project in Sanya with their Chinese partners, Huinong Capital.
They believe that HRC will be visiting Sanya as well in the same time frame and will meet with officials there.
They would love to say hello to HRC to show US businessmen committed to expanded US China trade relations if convenient for her

Special Report
WikiLeaks
17:00; 12/2/10
Media coverage in many countries of WikiLeaks releases is decreasing, with new stories from wire services on
Assanage and Interpol and the latest Russia reports. Reporting on specific cables is shifting to more local
issues, such as US military use of Ireland's Shannon Airport or US interest in Iran's activities in
Peru. Governments and many commentators assert US relationships will not be significantly damages, and
there are frequent observations that the releases have not revealed "anything new." Anti-US writers and media
continue to use the opportunity to skewer the United States.
Many of the items below are digests of more extensive Embassy reporting. Additional reporting is available
from post email submissions.
AF:
Burundi
Swahili Bonesha FM radio broadcast a report that a Spanish official told Embassy Madrid that Russia, Belarus,
and Chechnya had become a mafia states, and also mentioned anti-terrorism expert Russell Travers would
investigate the leak. The story suggested the leaks have embarrassed US diplomats.
Mali
No local mention in print or broadcast media in Mali.
Niger
No local media coverage.
Zimbabwe
An online website reports Zimbabwean political parties in a fragile coalition government on Tuesday dismissed
WikiLeaks revelations that a power sharing deal between them is doomed because of acute differences between
rival politicians.

Most local newspapers carry wire reports on Assange's legal situation. Dailies also cited Assange calling for
Secretary Clinton to if it's proved she ordered American diplomats to spy on U.N. officials. Local dailies focus
on Iran's President Ahmadinejad saying "the documents lack the legality and the credibility and they will not
affect on Iran's relations with other countries in the region." Dailies also focused on one alleged report that
Syrian President Al-Asad's "is not convinced Iran is developing nuclear weapons." There is no mention of the
Jordan-specific leaks in any print media.
A columnist writing for Al-Ghad contends the leaks will not harm the region or the US, although they could
undermine trust. He sates the documents show that the positions of the US and Middle Eastern states on
regional issues is clear. Another columnist writing for the same paper catalogues criticisms of international
leaders and concludes by wondering "what will happen next."
EIJR:
Azerbaijan
The only Azerbaijan-specific newspaper reporting is an article in opposition daily Yeni Musavat containing a
denial by the Bank of Baku of an allegation that it is involved in Iran's sanction-busting. Wide coverage of a
document comparing President Aliyev to both Sonny and Michael Corleone in the online news websites. TV
maintains tone that Wikileaks is criminal conspiracy and that the documents are inaccurate.
Finland
Coverage continues, but much reduced. Focus has shifted to the refusal of Finnish authorities, notably
President Halonen and FM Stubb, to comment on revelations about Finland that have emerged from the leaks.
Much speculation has focused on suggestions in the leaked documents that China had pressured Finland not to
accept Uigur prisoners being released by the U.S. from Guantanamo Bay. Finnish officials continue to assert
publicly that the leaks will not affect relations with the United States. It was also reported that Finland has no
plans to reassess its own policy on confidentiality. Commentary speculates about what may be revealed in the
future, but expects little damage to relations.
Germany
Coverage is still primarily focused on the domestic impact of the leaks, particularly on the hunt for the young
politician who allegedly provided the U.S. Embassy with confidential government documents. Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung and Sueddeutsche Zeitung said in a joint editorial that "those in Germany who thought
North Korea was a dark empire but not a real threat have been proven wrong by the WikiLeaks revelations."
Der Spiegel is continuing to publish new material on roughly the same timeline and topics as the New York
Times; today's coverage focused on Russia and was substantively the same as the English-language reporting
over the past few days.
Ireland
Media is focusing on specific revelations about the use of Shannon Airport by the U.S. military. According to
the Irish Daily Mirror "it appears the (Irish) government was not serious about dealing with real concerns about
the use of Shannon by the U.S. military on their way to Iraq and Afghanistan. Bloggers opine the Irish
government felt conflicted — it liked the revenue it received from U.S. troops passing through, as well as the
diplomatic benefits, but felt it had to placate the Irish public before the 2007 elections and publicly decry the
use of Shannon. The Irish Examiner relied on an excerpt from TIME Magazine's interview with Assange. An
analyst writing for the Irish Independent headlines "Diplomatic corps' horror is pure gold for historians,"
concluding that, ith 900 further Irish cables set to be published in the coming months, the trouble may only be
starting for the mandarins of Iveagh House (Department of Foreign Affairs)."
Malta
Interest in Wikileaks continues in the online media, with comments on the more general revelations. There
were no new pieces about Malta itself.

Montenegro
Over the course of the last two days, the Wikileaks story has moved from the cover pages and headlines of
Montenegro's media to the international news sections. All major electronic and print media carried the first
official statement of a Montenegrin official on the topic. PM Djukanovic said American diplomats were doing
their job and nothing can spoil the US-Montenegran relationship. There was wire coverage of the Interpol
warrant and Secretary Clinton at the OSCE.
Portugal
Calling it "an Invaluable Service to Democracy, a columnist for Niblico condemns "the orders that American
diplomats received to collect personal information from high-ranking international officials, and in particular,
Ban Ki-Moon's." He concludes that "The future of freedom is linked to the security and integrity of our
personal data — and I do not know that the U.S., after having lost 250,000 of its secret documents, is in any
condition to guarantee either one of them."
Switzerland:
Swiss press reports feature extensive coverage; however, very little new information. Items reported included
preparations for a Clinton meeting with Foreign Minister Micheline Calmy-Rey in 2009; the Swiss - Libya
affair; FBI-Swiss Federal Police liaison in 2006; Papers also reported that Julian Assange has contacts in
Switzerland and that a Swiss citizen from Basel is allegedly in charge of processing donations for
Wikileaks. According to the press, Assange met representatives of the Swiss Pirate Party in Geneva. Finally,
Swiss papers took up the story that Wikileaks might be targeting Bank of America, writing that the bank is
trying to calm down the stock markets. The NZZ published two opinion pieces. Both critical of the leaks for the
harm they do to diplomacy.
WHA:
Brazil
Brazilian media today featured extensive coverage. Folha de Sao Paulo dedicated six pages, including an op-ed
by Ambassador Shannon outlining the U.S. viewpoint. Folha's editorial said the information released is
relevant but neither surprising nor dangerous, while another outlet praised efforts by certain papers to filter the
information and adding that Wikileaks is on the whole valuable to society. A commentator in Folha wrote that
President Lula should not so quickly dismiss the U.S. observations about the GoB (which he claimed are likely
accurate), and another used the documents' description of President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin to
analyze the possible role of Lula in the Rousseff Administration.
Cuba
Cuban media coverage continues at levels similar to yesterday's. Online Cubadebate and Juventudrebelde.cu
publish wide-ranging articles, many of them culled from news wires, covering USG reaction, third country
reaction (Canada), and Wikileaks reaction (Julian Assange's "insurance" against prosecution and accusations
that Amazon violated the First Amendment). In commentary, Granma's Manuel E. Yepe, a Cuban lawyer,
economist, journalist and former Cuban ambassador to Romania, suggests that Wikileaks "yielded to pressure
from the USG and the media in managing how and when information was released, and insinuates that right
wing elements in the U.S. are behind the disclosure of the documents.
Eastern Caribbean:
Reporting continues to be general, with the exception of one radio report on StarCom's LOVE FM 104.1 that
WikiLeaks may soon release cables about the Caribbean, and mentioning that the U.S. Embassy in Port of Spain
released a statement that WikiLeaks' actions jeopardize the U.S. national security.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776619 Date: 08/31/2015
Discussion continues to dominate the front pages of major newspapers as well as the editorial pages--with an
increase in the number of opinion articles. Press continues to report and opine on the invitation to Ecuador
offered by Deputy Foreign Minister Kintto Lucas to Assange and the subsequent disclaimer and withdrawal of
the invitation by President Correa. Most articles criticized Lucas for his error. A tongue-in-cheek editorial in El
Universo "The Coming of Julian" expressed regrets that Assange would not be coming to Ecuador as he might
have revealed the secrets of the GOE and then would have faced the same or worse treatment that Ecuadorian
investigative journalists receive.
El Salvador
A columnist for El Diario de Hoy asked "What is the big deal?" He said the cables about Honduras "tell us
that the American diplomats were lost and did not understand what was happening" during the coup
there. Any Ambassador who is not reporting on the mental state of people like Hugo Chavez, Daniel Ortega,
Evo Morales and Cristina Kirchner, is not doing his job ... This is all so routine that it cannot greatly affect
American diplomacy ..." Salvadoran media reporting continues to rely almost exclusively on wire
stories. Locally produced articles and TV/radio reports have focused on reaction from Foreign Minister
Martinez and Ambassador Aponte, both of whom have repeatedly explained the nature of diplomatic
correspondence and have underscored the strength of the US-Salvadoran bilateral relationship.
Honduras
The buzz around the WikiLeaks scandal is slowly taking a backseat — for now -- to Honduran issues such as
taxes and security issues. Conservative Tribuna had a positive editorial arguing countries maintain relations
with each other based on national interest. It suggested "the importance of the U.S. on the global stage will
ensure that other countries will continue to work closely with Washington in the pursuit of those interests." An
op-ed in liberal daily Tiempo titled "In defense of Ambassador Hugo Llorens," stressed that diplomats must
provide honest advice to their government. Tiempo's op-ed claims that "the documents divulged so far
havebeen, in their majority, frivolities without importance, however highly sensitive and dangerous issues could
pop up in them...[d]iplomacy is a prolonged example of hypocrisy and cynicism."
Mexico
El Universal in its editorial questions the wholesale, unfiltered dumping of classified information; "the fact that
a government hides something does not make it damnable. It's normal.. .for diplomats to prepare reports about
the countries and leaders where they are posted." The paper asserts that "it may be interesting to know that
U.S. officials had questions about the mental health of the president of Argentina, but the benefit to citizens of
such a revelation is marginal in proportion to the potential damage to relations between the two countries." An
op-ed writer for El Universal, claims that the "released documents show U.S. diplomats rummaging through
personal lives and privately mocking the same leaders whom they publicly treat as friends." Another daily La
Jornada's in its editorial concludes that "the main factor of diplomatic tension and greatest security risk to
world peace is not Wikileaks but Washington's belligerent, unilateral and imperialist warmongering, aggravated
now by its defense of opacity."
Peru
Peru media are focusing on the first alleged cable to come from Peru, on US concern about Iran's interest in
Peru's uranium, as well as regional "revelations" in regards neighboring Chile, Venezuela and Argentina. TV,
radio and internet reflect similar slants.
Venezuela
Articles on Interpol's "Red Notice" for Julian Assange appeared in most dailies. El Nacional cites assessments
by the Embassy's Economic Counselor about the development of nuclear energy in Venezuela. El Mundo
reports alleged comments by then Ambassador Duddy describing the Venezuelan bank interventions in
November 2009. A columnist in government owned Correo de Orinoco says accuses the U.S. of diplomatic
'excesses,' torture in occupied territories, hiring contractors that fire on crowds, using lies to justify wars in
Iraq, Afghanistan, and Yemen. Taking a different tack, an Op-Ed in El Universal remarks sarcastically, "the

U.S. does not have friends, only interests. Bold discovery! Only the ignorant, the naïve, or the crazy — or a
combination of those three — can say that this constitutes an international declassification." An article in the
online edition of La Verdad of Maracaibo speculates the State Department is using Wikileaks to put out
information it does not want to release directly.

I know you are busy but I wanted to close the loop with you on the ED position (Lois Quam), the chair position for
Operations Committee, and the need to ensure that there is specific language in the QDDR that keeps PEPFAR in the
State Department (one or two sentences). I believe it is in all our interests to do this. [AGREE] I also wanted to discuss
with you the process to determine the benchmarks. [I WISH WE COULD GET THEM IN QDDR SO THERE IS FIRMNESS
AND CLARITY— WORRIED IF WE DO IT LATER IT WILL BE A NEGOTIATION AND SQUISHY]; Raj is hesitant to concretize,
plus I know he is very busy. We are going to deliver to him today a version that has been agreed on by CDC and OGAC. I
will propose a process that would include a public vetting of the benchmarks but do not think the benchmarks need to
be specifically defined in the QDDR. [FINE BUT SEE ABOVE — CAN I SEE DRAFT AS IS?] The reference to the Operations
Committee and the Secretary as the trigger for movement into USAID is enough.
I have been made aware of a growing discussion on the Hill around GHI as an attempt by the Administration to diminish
the PEPFAR program contributions because of its association with President Bush. Last night's prime time FOX news
piece (>10 minutes) on PEPFAR was well done. President Bush was clear about why he started PEPFAR and why he feels
it is still the right thing to do and to continue (Humanitarian/Security both addressed). He also spoke directly to the
bipartisan nature of the program (from inception) and the need to continue bipartisan support. It was a missed
opportunity not to have had President Obama on the FOX piece to make the point that "GNI is building on PEPFAR..."
and to begin a bipartisan dialogue. (WH declined as I understand it) [WE SHOULD MAKE THIS POINT — S ALWAYS CREDITS

I am here through Saturday, then off to Bulgaria to lay in the reform efforts at the Global Fund retreat followed by the
GF Board meeting in Geneva (I won't stay for the whole meeting, just the first day). John Monahan and I have been
aggressive in insisting on Board Chair (BC)and Vice Chair (VC) coordination of the reform effort. This has been reflected
in a letter from BC and VC with ED support that the retreat directly address and coordinate the reform effort, establish a
level for round 10 and address the Maternal and Child Health GF expansion (GWI supports). I feel we will establish
targets and timelines in this meeting with a reporting structure directly to the Board. In addition, there will be
politicking on the election of a new Board Chair (Tedros' term ends in April). It is critical the new chair be fully aligned
with the reform efforts. [GOT IT— FLAGGING FOR S TOO]

Subject: excerpt from Julian Assange live online Q and A with the Guardian today
I am a former British diplomat. In the course of my former duties I helped to coordinate multilateral action against a
brutal regime in the Balkans, impose sanctions on a renegade state threatening ethnic cleansing, and negotiate a
debt relief programme for an impoverished nation. None of this would have been possible without the security and
secrecy of diplomatic correspondence, and the protection of that correspondence from publication under the laws of
the UK and many other liberal and democratic states. An embassy which cannot securely offer advice or pass
messages back to London is an embassy which cannot operate. Diplomacy cannot operate without discretion and the
protection of sources. This applies to the UK and the UN as much as the US.
In publishing this massive volume of correspondence, Wikileaks is not highlighting specific cases of wrongdoing but
undermining the entire process of diplomacy. If you can publish US cables then you can publish UK telegrams and UN
emails.
My question to you is: why should we not hold you personally responsible when next an international crisis goes
unresolved because diplomats cannot function.
Julian Assange:
If you trim the vast editorial letter to the singular question actually asked, I would be happy to give it my attention.

DPRK CONDUCTS ARTILLERY DRILL NEAR MARITIME BORDER
(SBU) The drill, heard in the Republic of Korea, was contained within Democratic People's Republic of Korea

As Haiti enters the period of electoral contestation, it is essential that all political actors remain
calm and encourage their supporters to do the same. The United States, together with Haiti's
international community partners, stands ready to support efforts to thoroughly review irregularities
in support of electoral results that are consistent with the will of the Haitian people expressed in
their votes.
Like others, the Government of the United States is concerned by the Provisional Electoral
Council's announcement of results from the November 28 national elections that are inconsistent
with the published results of the National Election Observation Council (CNO), which had more
than 5,500 observers and observed the vote count in 1,600 voting centers nationwide, election-day
observations by official U.S. observers accredited by the CEP, and vote counts observed around the
country by numerous domestic and international observers.
Haiti's transition to democracy over the past 24 years has seen many successes, overcoming major
challenges. The 2010 elections represent a critical test of whether the Haitian people will
determine their destiny through their vote. The United States is committed to the consolidation of
democracy in Haiti and calls on the Government of Haiti, the CEP and all political forces to ensure
that the will of the people is fully reflected in the outcome of this election.

I spoke to Liz this morning and explained where we are in terms of the interagency and green lighting invitations (i.e.,
very close, but not there yet). She said that at this point we will probably not be able to attract the number and level of
corporate leaders we originally envisioned for next Tuesday. Liz certainly could pull together something with USGLC
board members and some military leadership, but if she is to only get one bite of the apple with HRC her
recommendation is to "do it right" and move this to January (either the week of the 10th or 241. The idea in January
would be to include members of congress and frame the event as the QDDR making the case for State/USAID's mission
and resources in the new environment. We could take the event in a number of directions (Liz would LOVE to get Gates
together with Clinton) but the idea to launch the QDDR in January with USGLC as the blueprint for supporting
international affairs and the 150 account.
Thoughts? -D

Subject: Re: Sujay
Senator DeMint is insisting that he and Sujay sit down to personally review her post-hearing QFR answers. This is highly
unusual. We offered Sujay up right away, but DeMint's staff insisted that the Senator was only available to meet on
December 16 (the Senate target adjournment date is December 17). This effectively scuttles any chance Sujay has of
getting confirmed this Congress.
Unfortunately, we don't have much recourse. Sujay's nomination will remain on Tuesday's business meeting agenda, but
given his request, DeMint will exercise his prerogative and ask that she be held over. With no other business meetings
scheduled this year, she'll remain stuck in Committee.
There's another factor at play here too. We learned yesterday afternoon that Sujay has taken it upon herself to reach out
to different Senator's offices. I don't know what exactly she's been saying, but the leg officer (a State Department fellow)
handling Sujay's nomination got an email from Hatch's office. He has been supportive of her and we have a good working
relationship with them. I don't know what Sujay said, but the message back from Hatch's person is that "while we do
support her, this really makes us question her common sense and judgment." We obviously told her to stop her outreach
campaign.
Finally, Hatch's office also informed us that Brownback is rumored to be considering a hold on Sujay's nomination if
DeMint for any reason relents.

Of Funds To Haiti's Central Government
And Of Travel Visas For The Government's Leaders
Who Are 'Trying To Subvert The Will Of The People'
[(FRIDAY, Dec. 10) -- US. Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) Friday said he has urged the Obama Administration
to withhold funding to the central government of Haiti, and to suspend visas for travel to the United States by
senior Haitian Government officials and their immediate family members, until necessary steps are taken to
ensure a fair and democratic outcome to the elections held on November 28, 2010. Leahy chairs the Senate
Appropriations Committee 's Subcommittee on The State Department and Foreign Operations, which handles
the Senate 's work in funding foreign assistance, including aid to Haiti, and the State Department's
budget. Leahy also chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, which handles immigration policy issues. Leahy
released the following statement.]
"As if Haiti did not have enough problems, now, once again, those in power there are trying to
subvert the will of the people. The United States must come down squarely in support of the
Haitian people's right to choose their leaders freely and fairly. By suspending direct aid to the
central government and visas for top officials and their immediate family members, the United
States would be sending that message. This process needs to bring about a legitimate
government respected by the Haitian people and recognized by the international community."

Twas the Night Before the QDDR
December 13, 2010
By Connie Veillette in Rethinking U.S. Foreign Assistance Tags: QDDR
Twas two weeks before Christmas, when all through the town
Breaths were held expectantly, in the midst of a countdown.
With their keyboards ready, the bloggers abandoned all care,
Hoping that Secretary Clinton soon would be there.
The NGOs were nestled all snug in their beds,
Knowing the QDDR soon would be read.
And the Senate and House, with a sharp rap,
Had just left town for a long winter's nap.
When out on the Mall there arose such a clatter,
Aid analysts sprang from their cubicles to see what was the matter.
Away to their lnboxes they flew like a flash,
Tore open their emails and emptied the cache.
The moon on the breast of the soon-to-fall snow
Gave the lustre of mid-day to the stalled traffic below.
When, what to their wondering eyes should appear,
But an armored car, and eight men in full gear.

With a diplomatic wit, married to Bill,
They knew in a moment it must be St Hill.
More rapid than eagles her people, they came,
And she whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!
"Now Slaughter! Now, Radelet! Now, Geithner and Shah!
On, Nides! On, Steinberg! On Yohannes, hurrah!
To the top of the White House! To the top of the Hill!
Now dash away! Dash away! Get us good will!"
And then, in a flash, her people took to the phone
Spreading the word about what few had known.
As the developmentistas gathered to find common ground,
Behind the podium St Hillary came with a bound.
Her eyes-how they twinkled! Her hair how flaxen!
Her cheeks were like roses, the cameras were flashin'!
Her smart red suit was adorned with a bow,
The perfect "development diplomat" from head to toe.
She addressed the crowd on integration and elevation,
And gave USAID some special designation!
A wink of her eye and a twist of her head,
Soon let them dream that they had fewer things to dread.
She spoke many words, and expressed her complete vision,
While her colleagues set about implementing the QDDR's decision.
And laying her finger aside of her nose,
And giving a nod, she departed, nothing else to disclose!
She sprang to her car, to her team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But they heard her exclaim, 'ere she drove out of sight,
"Just trust me on this, it will all be alright!"
May all your dreams come true, from your friends at the Rethinking U.S. Foreign Assistance initiative — Connie,
Sarah Jane, and Casey — and with many thanks for the creative talents of Casey Dunning and Julie Walz.

Ambassador Richard C. Holbrooke passed away this evening, surrounded by his wife, Kati, his sons David and
Anthony, his step-children Elizabeth and Chris Jennings, his daughter-in-law Sarah, and the rest of their
family.
Secretary Clinton released the following statement on his passing:
STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON
Passing of Richard Holbrooke
Tonight America has lost one of its fiercest champions and most dedicated public servants. Richard Holbrooke
served the country he loved for nearly half a century, representing the United States in far-flung war-zones and
high-level peace talks, always with distinctive brilliance and unmatched determination. He was one of a kind --
a true statesman -- and that makes his passing all the more painful.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05778383 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05778383 Date: 08/31/2015
From his early days in Vietnam to his historic role bringing peace to the Balkans to his last mission in
Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard helped shape our history, manage our perilous present, and secure our future.
He was the consummate diplomat, able to stare down dictators and stand up for America's interests and values
even under the most difficult circumstances. He served at every level of the Foreign Service and beyond,
helping mentor generations of talented officers and future ambassadors. Few people have ever left a larger mark
on the State Department or our country. From Southeast Asia to post-Cold War Europe and around the globe,
people have a better chance of a peaceful future because of Richard's lifetime of service.
I had the privilege to know Richard for many years and to call him a friend, colleague and confidante. As
Secretary of State, I have counted on his advice and relied on his leadership. This is a sad day for me, for the
State Department and for the United States of America.
True to form, Richard was a fighter to the end. His doctors marveled at his strength and his willpower, but to his
friends, that was just Richard being Richard. I am grateful for the tireless efforts of all the medical staff, and to
everyone who sat by his side or wished him well in these final days.
Tonight my thoughts and prayers are with Richard's beloved wife Kati, his sons David and Anthony, his step-
children Elizabeth and Chris Jennings, his daughter-in-law Sarah, and all of his countless friends and
colleagues.

Clinton Seeks to Revamp Diplomacy, Development
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
Filed at 11:26 a.m. EST
WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday will unveil plans to restore civilian diplomacy and
development to its former role as the leading edge of American foreign policy.
Clinton is scheduled to present the results of a wide-ranging review of the operations of the State Department and U.S. Agency for
International Development, conducted with the aim of better responding to global threats and emergencies. The proposed changes will
"give our military the partner it needs and deserves," according to an advance copy of the document obtained by The Associated Press.
The plan calls for hiring 5,500 new personnel, creating new positions and the consolidating others under a revamped and streamlined
leadership structure.
The plan also outlines a strategy to reduce the government's reliance on private contractors, which has rapidly expanded over the past
decade, particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We will work to break down walls between agencies," Clinton wrote in an introduction. "We will eliminate overlap, set priorities, and
fund only the work that supports those priorities. We will empower our people to make decisions and hold them accountable for the
results."
No price tag is associated with the changes, which are being presented as a new Congress prepares to be seated next month. Many
Republicans, who are now the majority in the House, have called for deep spending cuts in the State Department and foreign operations
budgets. Moreover, one of Clinton's most powerful allies in efforts to boost civilian operations — Defense Secretary Robert Gates —
plans to leave his post sometime in the coming year.
In her introduction, Clinton said the goal is to ensure that the taxpayer dollar is spent wisely. "It's an important exercise even in the best
economic times. In tough times, it's critical," she wrote.

The plan would set up bureaus for international energy affairs and crisis and conflict operations at State, as well as offices for policy
planning and science and technology at USAID. It would also add a special State Department cyber security coordinator and expand the
department's counterterrorism office.
More broadly, the review calls for giving greater authority to ambassadors and other senior diplomats abroad, making them the top
managers for implementing policy across all U.S. government agencies that have offices in their respective embassies or consulates.
"It sounds basic, but it's the kind of change that will help us tap the full potential of our civilian power," Clinton wrote.
The proposals grow out of the findings of a Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review that Clinton ordered when she became
secretary of state, and reflects the Obama administration's "smart power" approach to foreign policy stressing civilian over military
operations.
The review is dedicated to the late Richard Holbrooke, the veteran diplomat who died Monday.
"He represented the best of our nation's civilian power," it says. "He understood that we cannot project our leadership unless we also
promote our values."
The plan proposes expanding the existing undersecretary of state for democracy and global affairs position to include civilian security
and human rights. The new crisis and conflict operations bureau would report to this official and coordinate civilian responses to
humanitarian emergencies with USAID.
At USAID,the proposal calls for tripling the hiring of midlevel workers from 30 to 95 per year to reduce reliance on outside contractors.
This aims to reverse the 38 percent decline in the agency's work force between 1990 and 2007.

HI Cheryl,
Thank you once again for the lift to Santo Domingo and for your support and friendship.
After our adventure last night, I had a delayed reaction to my good news. At the risk of sounding corny, I work
up this morning feeling glad to be alive, thankful for the privilege of working with smart, dedicated and
passionate people like you, and fortunate to live in a country with clean water, electricity, education, and

I hope that you, David and your kids have a happy, safe and healthy holiday season.
Warmly,

Richard Holbrooke, Pakistan's hero:
He had a vision for our future
New York Daily News.
By Ahmed Rashid <http://www.nydailynews.com/authors/Ahmed%20Rashid> Wednesday, December 15th 2010, 4:00

•No American has tried as hard to ease the fears, apprehensions, doubts, conspiracy theories and ill-informed views of
Pakistanis toward the U.S. <http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/United+States> as has Richard Holbrooke
<http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Richard+Holbrooke>. His death is a tragedy for American diplomacy - but much
more so for Pakistan <http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Pakistan>, because whether you liked him or disliked him,
there is no denying that in the last two years, he constantly battled for Pakistan.
The image of Holbrooke wading through floodwater, distributing relief goods to this year's 20 million flood victims - not
once but repeatedly at the ripe age of 69 - is an indelible one, that our own much younger leaders barely ever
replicated. He pushed for U.S. helicopters to be deployed in Pakistan for the flood victims. He pushed for more aid
money for Pakistan from a reluctant Congress.
He helped start a dialogue on a dozen different issues - which will be his lasting legacy - and he pushed Pakistan,
especially its army, to change its ways. Under the proverbial cover of national interest, we Pakistanis never made life
easier for him or for ourselves by confronting the new realities of terrorism, our lack of political leadership or our
collapsing economy.
But Holbrooke soldiered on.

At times he may have been aggressive and pushy, loud and boisterous, too quintessentially American, too bluntly New
York <http://www.nydailvnews.com/topics/New+York>.
But ultimately none of that mattered, because he bought to the table for the first time - after the preferred ignorance of
the Bush administration and its lackadaisical love affair with Gen. Pervez Musharraf
<http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Pervez+Musharraf> - a strategic vision to the U.S.-Pakistan relationship.
What was this vision? That America would remain committed to Pakistan's progress over the long term, even after the
Afghanistan <http://www.nvdaiIvnews.com/topics/Afghanistan> war was over, and that it would help improve Pakistani
relations with India <http://www.nyclailynews.comitopics/Ind ia> .
This was crucial: Unlike many who came before him and will come after, Holbrooke thought Pakistan was important for
its own sake, not just because America wanted to defeat the Taliban
<http://www.nydailynews.cornitopics/The+Taliban> in Afghanistan or solidify trade relationships with India.
He recognized the deep feelings of mistrust and ambivalence that still exist in Pakistan toward the U. S. He knew better
than anyone in the U.S. administration that diplomacy makes a difference when diplomats deal with the realities on the
ground - and not a preconceived image of what should be.
We should remember that all this time, Holbrooke battled the odds back in Washington
<http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Washington%2c+DC> . The Obama administration
<http://www.nyclailynews.comitopics/Barack+Obama> was and is heavily divided between the Obama-controlled
White House <http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/The+White+House> , the Hillary Clinton
<http://www.nydailynews.comitopics/Hillary+Clinton> -controlled State Department
<http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/U.S.+Department+of+State> - in which he was her key adviser on global issues -
and the all-powerful Pentagon. Not to speak of a Congress that, even when Democratic-controlled, kept trying to put
awkward strings on aid to Pakistan, which Holbrooke opposed.
Holbrooke was a pain in the rear end for many of these power centers. At times he was ignored by the White House or
by the Pentagon <http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/The+Pentagon> . At other times he was castigated by Congress.
But Holbrooke, a strong-willed man, stuck to his convictions.
Whoever comes after him will be far less likely to have that strength of character - call it pigheadedness, if you like - and
that will be a great loss.
It is especially problematic as Pakistan's future continues to teeter. The military still gives sanctuary to the Taliban.
Extremism is still spreading. The international community still raises fears about the safety of its nuclear weapons. As
the end game in Afghanistan approaches, some in Pakistan are pressuring against a final settlement of hostilities there.
Some in America will be happy to have a thorn removed from their sides. But many Pakistanis will remember Richard
Holbrooke fondly: He was tirelessly fighting for a more stable future for our country. We have lost a friend, and whoever
replaces him will never quite measure up.

The Envoy
Posted by Hendrik Hertzberg
Last night, as I was unlocking my bike on a windswept Greenwich Village sidewalk after leaving a holiday party, a friend
approached, cell phone in hand. A few minutes earlier, she and I had been inside, chatting happily amid the buzz and warmth of
a holiday party. Now she had tears in her eyes. "Richard Holbrooke died," she said.
Notwithstanding the hospital bulletins since he fell ill on Saturday—critical condition, damaged aorta, emergency surgery—this
sudden, awful ending was a shock, because Richard Holbrooke was such an astounding volcano of vitality. Everything about
him was large: his physical size, including the ultimate "in your face" face, a face like a Times Square billboard; his buzz-saw
voice, a highly expressive instrument, equally adept at piano (a side-of-the-mouth, gossipy wisecrack, often pleasingly nasty)
and forte (a high-decibel outburst of anger or indignation, almost always calculated for effect); his appetites (for experience, for
danger, for praise, for power, for fun); and his ambitions (for himself, for his beliefs, for the United States, for the world). He
was no doe-eyed peacenik, but as a diplomat he labored long and hard to seek alternatives to war and ways to end particular
wars. He was sentimental about his own unsentimentality, romantic about his own tough-guy realism.
Unlike my tearful informant, who had known Holbrooke as a family friend since she was a little girl, I was acquainted with him
in the casual way of many journalists and editors. He was a peer as well as a "source," a prolific and forceful writer whose
favorite venues, The New Republic and The New Yorker, happened to be the places where I've spent my working life. He was
gregarious and fond of big, splashy black-tie evenings. The last time I saw him was six weeks ago, on November 1st, at the
New York Public Library's "Literary Lions" celebration. At the pre-dinner reception, where he would normally have been on
his feet, looming large, he repaired to a folding chair behind a little table and let his wife, Kati Marton, bring the party to him.
At sixty-nine he was tired—that much was obvious—but he was as sharp and voluble as ever. He still had plenty to do.
Not long after Holbrooke achieved his greatest diplomatic triumph by negotiating the 1995 end to the Balkan wars, I asked him
if he liked Warren Zevon's wonderful song "The Envoy." He said he'd never heard of it. The next day I sent him a CD. After
that, he mentioned it every single time I've seen him, up to and including that NYPL gala, saying he puts it on, loud, when he
needs a lift. And no wonder: his life was a drama, and he liked it that way.
If the Supreme Court had allowed the votes to be counted in 2000, then the Envoy, almost certainly, would have become the
Secretary of State, and the next decade would have unfolded very differently. As it is, Holbrooke has left a stronger, more
positive, more creative mark on history than all but a few of those who have held that post. He certainly did not die of a broken
heart—Kati Marton saw to that—but it was surely the ghastly, impossible demands of his last, impossible assignment that

brought on the rending of his aorta. He died for his country as surely as any soldier. And his deathbed words may turn out to be
the most important he ever spoke.
