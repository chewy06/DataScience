Status update on the Chris Stevens mission to Benghazi:
The current game plan is for Mr. Stevens to move no later than Wednesday from Malta to Benghazi. He will stage off
shore initially for a one day visit during which he will have meetings with TNC interlocutors and get a sense of the
situation on the ground. The goal of this one day trip is for him to lay the groundwork for a stay of up to 30 days.
He will be accompanied by a DS team, a staff member from Embassy Tripoli and the leader of USAID's DART team. With
the support of Ambassador Cretz and Embassy Tripoli, Mr Stevens is in contact with TNC members on the ground in
Benghazi and elsewhere; the team is also in contact with other diplomatic missions and NGOs in Benghazi. We expect to
get support in particular from the Turks who have a consulate in Benghazi.
Mr. Stevens team has been in touch with Africom planners on the details of the mission. We have made the official
request for support from OSD but have yet to get approval. Once we have that — and we hope that will be very soon --
we will be able to move forward with the planning.

(SBU) Per Special Envoy Stevens:
• The situation in Ajdabiyah has worsened to the point where Stevens is considering departure from Benghazi. The
envoy's delegation is currently doing a phased checkout (paying the hotel bills, moving some comms to the boat,
etc). He will monitor the situation to see if it deteriorates further, but no decision has been made on departure. He will
wait 2-3 more hours, then revisit the decision on departure.
He received reports of shelling last night in Ajdabiyah as well as snipers shooting people in the city. AFRICOM
reported Qadhafi's forces took the eastern and western gates of Ajdabiyah, with 5 vehicles at the eastern gate and 50 at
the western gate. More Qadhafi forces are heading to Ajdabiyah from Brega.
The Brits report Qadhafi forces are moving from Sirte to Brega, which they interpret as preparation for another
assault on Ajdabiyah today.
He plans to discuss the situation further with the Brits, Turks, and the TNC to see if this is an irreversible
situation. Departure would send a significant political signal, and would be interpreted as the U.S. losing confidence in
the TNC. Initial message to the TNC would frame the departure as due to security grounds and as a temporary measure
only.
Polaschik said she would discuss these developments with Amb. Cretz.
If the group departs, the contract for the boat stipulates they return to Greece. One scenario could be the group
stages elsewhere for a few days.
Ops will continue to monitor the situation.

Politicallecsmomic developments
Coda McCain: Senator McCain had an enthusiastic reception in Benghazi. The TNC welcomed his strong
statements of support, and US flag-waving Libyans cheered him wherever he went. The INC praised the
introduction of US Predator aircraft and asked that the US jam Libyan television broadcasting, The NC's
finance minister told him that his top ptiotities are to obtain a line of credit to meet basic needs, and to find a
way under the sanctions to allow trade with the liberated parts of Libya. He was impressed by the civilian
leadership but came away with serious doubts about the military's leadership, organization, and capabilities. He
was heartened to hear that the MC plans to shake up the military leadership and appoint a minister of defense--
equivalent as early as next week. In a press conference, he advocated the use of more effective US strike
aircraft in the NATO missions and US facilitation of 3"I party arms transfers to the rebels; be stopped short of
endorsing the introduction of US military advisers, saying that role could be filled by others. He was clearly
moved by the plight of the people of Misrata and visited a hospital where he met a number of patients who were
severely wounded in the fighting there. The Human Rights Watch representative in Benghazi and a INC
member from Misrata briefed him on the situation there.
Consular issue: Conoff received the deceased Amcies personal effects from the IOM representative in Benghazi
and submitted them to the UK delegation in Benghazi in order to be flown out with the body. The Aincifs body
departed Libya on the evening of 22 April.
Injured Arncit will board a UNICEF-chartered ship that will depart Misurata at 2300 local time on B6
22 April and will arrive in Malta approximately 22 hours later.
A memorial service for the journalists was held at the Tibesti hotel, attended by INC deputy chairman Abd al-
Hafidh Goglia, the UK envoy, and the US envoy. Ghoga and the envoys also delivered remarks.

Subject: McCain update
The Watch received the following readout of CODEL McCain's Apri123 meetings in Cairo.
Foreign Minister Alaraby:
McCain discussed his visit to Libya, emphasizing it appeared a stalemate was emerging. McCain supported the
decision to send in predator drones and would like NATO to provide equipment, as well as training, to the rebel
forces. McCain characterized the TNC as "good people," but said its military was far less impressive.
Regarding the possibility of Egypt increasing aid to the TNC, Alaraby said Egypt was reluctant to provide additional
support out of concern for the estimated 1 million Egyptian nationals living in Libya.
Alaraby reiterated Egypt is in no rush to restore diplomatic relations with Iran.
Alaraby said Egypt will abide by all agreements made with Israel. He encouraged the United States to support, or
at least not oppose, recognition of Palestinian statehood in the UN.
McCain said the USG had discussed a modest assistance package for Egypt, but warned it was probably more
modest than Egypt wished given the current economic climate. McCain planned to organize a group of businessmen to
visit Egypt and encouraged Alaraby to create a more pro-business environment.
Defense Minister, Field Marshall Tantawi:
The meeting focused on Libya and strategies to increase U.S. and Egyptian assistance. The discussion was not as in
depth as McCain's meeting with the FM. Tantawi echoed Alaraby's concern about Egyptian nationals in Libya and
request for increased U.S. assistance.

Subject: Stevens update
Security: Today's focus is on the security situation in Benghazi. There is new local reporting that hotels are being
targeted. The INC conducted a raid on a house/storage facility and found and arrested an Egyptian cell reportedly there
for the purpose of attacking hotels. It is believed they were connected to the cell arrested last week, and that
Interrogation of those arrested earlier led to this round of arrests. Ahmed Qadafadarn, cousin of Qadhafi who was
envoy to Egypt (and was rumored to have defected), is purportedly the funder and organizer of this cell.
CA updated its travel guidance to tell travelers to stay away from the Fadihi Hotel. Stevens will inform the INC this
afternoon. [NOTE: for your reference, I appended the new WM at the end of this email.]
Stevens will be meeting with MFA in one hour and will make a written request for better security at the hotel and
for better security-related coordination. He still feels comfortable in the hotel. They are looking into the idea of moving
into a villa, but that is some way off. Need to consider resource requirements (would need TDY'er with authority to sign
lease, hire local guards, etc.). Based on discussion with DS yesterday, the hotel remains the safest location. Stevens will
continue to work to have the TNC post more people outside and beef up security presence. They have a good set back
and are way off the ground.
Flights: Stevens checked with head of the airport. There are no regular humanitarian or other flights, however,
there are flights coming in and the airport could support an air bridge if any country wanted to sat one up. Stevens will
see his European counterparts this afternoon and will ask how they are bringing in their people and whether we can be
part of it.
- Trip to Rome: Stevens doesn't know yet if Jai is going to Rome. As of now, he's inclined not to go but he might
change his mind. If the Department thinks he ought to go, Stevens can pass that message. As it stands now Mahmoud
Jabril and All Tarhouni will be going.
Misrata: Stevens spoke with Brig. Gen. Hassi re Misrata. The general was pretty dear that the ostensible move by
Qadhafi forces out of the area is a ruse. They are withdrawing troops so they won't be hit by NATO, but will send them
back in in civilian clothing so they can continue killing that way. Hassi said the assertion Qadhafi would leave to the
tribes to resolve was ridiculous because there are no armed tribes around.

Contrast between Benghazi and reports from the West: Here in Benghazi since Thursday, I have joined our
representative, Chris Stevens, in meetings with a large number of representatives from the TNC, civil society, UN
organizations and NG0s, and the diplomatic corps. While we had no idea that our trip would correspond with significant
military advances in the east and the start of the coordinated Tripoli uprising dubbed "Operation Mermaid Dawn," the
timing gave us the opportunity to note the contrast between the relative bureaucratic quiet here compared to hyped-up
activity in western Libya. Clearly, some coordination is underway between Benghazi and the west: Ali Tarhouni, recently
promoted to Deputy Prime Minister In a still-to-be-completed cabinet reshufle, previewed the Tripoli uprising with us,
down almost to the minute. Yet one feels that, to a large extent, TNC officials are observers and chroniclers rather than
the authors of the unfolding developments to the west. (In a telling anecdote, just after confiding in us the plans for
Tripoli about to unfold, Tarhouni turned off his ringing cell phone, to concentrate on talking to us in a leisurely
manner.) What TNC officials told us to a large extent was sensible and mostly reassuring in its content -- and the TNC
just issued a directive reiterating its policy to treat combatants according to the Geneva conventions and observe human
rights -- but their comments fell mostly in the category of passive analysis rather than aggressive forward
thinking. Washington has task forces in focused on Tripoli; Benghazi does not
While there's a sense in the air that the final battles have begun, that palpable anticipation does not seem to have
translated into the type of stepped-up bureaucratic activity that one would expect. After meeting with us for nearly two
hours on Thursday, TNC Executive Committee chair (and PM equivalent) Mahmoud Jibril returned to Doha rather than
head any kind of war room here. I was on the ground far longer than Jibril, giving another cameo appearance
here. Tarhouni confided that there is no plan for when or how the TNC would relocate quickly to Tripoli, should Tripoli
fall. TNC Chairman Mustafa Abduljalil (who remains by all accounts a unifying figure here) is a humble, retiring leader,
which after Qadhafi's flamboyance is part of the attraction for Libyans but which does not make him naturally think of
how to project INC authority and symbolism quickly to the newly liberated areas. The question is when Tripoli falls, do
the extensive plans that the TNC has made about the post Qadhafi transitional structures have any relevance for
Tripoli? I do not want to overplay this: the flags being raised in the western towns are the flags used here. Our visit to
the military command center demonstrated that there is active information flow (if not exactly command and control)
passing between east and west. Tarhouni and others who visit western towns, usually from Tunis, describe support
there and from tribal leaders across Libya. No other groups are claiming to have established or planned for an
alternative civilian authority to compete with the TNC. Still, in our engagement with TNC officials, we will need to
remind them continually of the imperative to nurture their legitimacy and authority and to prevent a political vacuum
that others could fill -- especially after Tripoli falls and the INC is here, not there.
We've talked a lot about Tripoli and whether a battle for the capital could be avoided, which we argued would be the
best solution. One of the TNC's assets is the moral distinction between what the Libya that the TNC aspires to promote
and how Qadhafi has treated Libya's citizens. The world's attention will focus on a battle for Tripoli, we cautioned, and
acts of brutality and revenge and potential internal fights among competing militias will blur that moral distinction even
more than the assassination of INC Chief of Staff Abdulfatah Younis already did. The damage to the TNC's credibility
could be irreparable. We also noted that a TNC led negotiation that succeeds in winning Tripoli without a fight would
underscore the TNC leadership far more dramatically than a successful militia assault only vaguely connected to the
Benghazi leadership. The TNC officials heard us out patiently, but they clearly were not in the mood to negotiate. They
feel confident about the current military situation, and they remain convinced that Qadhafi simply will not give up no
matter how high the pressure. If anything, their positions have hardened in recent weeks, with Abduljalil telling us that
the TNC will no longer contemplate Qadhafi staying in Libya once he is out of power. Saif Qadhafi is seen in the same
category as his father. I do not believe that anything short of a significant change -- Qadhafi's departure, a military

setback that punctures the TNC's current confidence, NATO insisting on a pause in operations in favor of negotiations --
will persuade the TNC leadership that it is in their interest right now to offer Qadhafi a peaceful way out. Tarhouni also
acknowledged with his trademark candor that, to the Libyan people right now, negotiations would appear weak and
not a satisfactory climax to the revolution. They do have a point that, despite signs of desperation around Qadhafi (e.g.,
Mohammed Ismail's multiple attempts to contact Gene Cretz and me), there is no indication that Qadhafi himself is
prepared to throw in the towel. There is real fear that, should Qadhafi somehow make it from Tripoli to Sebha, a guerilla
war could persist for years, with supplies and mercernaries smuggled across the Saharan border.
Among other topics, we pushed the INC officials hard on starting a high-profile discussion immediately on the
reconciliation which is part of the TNC's platform. We noted that the many victims of Qadhafi's 42-year rule will be less
likely to pursue individual acts of revenge If they are assured that there will be some form to address grievances through
rule-of-law accountability. The same message should also appeal to average Libyans who for whatever reason remained
as part of Qadhafi's regime to the end but who have no blood on their hands and might otherwise fear retribution. INC
officials refer approvingly to the South African and Moroccan models, and they reiterated their commitment for an
inclusive process for Libya's future that welcomes all but the most notorious individuals around Qadhafi. Yet they still
seem to rely largely on (variously described) luck, tribal discipline, and the "gentle character" of the Libyan people as the
best assurances against abuse and revenge killings. We will continue to push on this.
Benghazi remained full of chatter about the Abdulfatah Younis assassination. With tribal visits and investigation
committees and cabinet changes, the INC addressed the immediate crisis sufficiently effectively that the intiial tension
and gunfire quickly dissipated. But the assassination highlighted two realities of Libyan life that TNC officials had
previously tried to downplay: tribes and militias. Rather than denying the tribal affiliations of Libyans, TNC officials are
now looking to the tribes as part of the solution in enforcing discipline and preventing the type of widescale looting and
pillaging that destroyed Benghazi's security infrastructure in March. Tribes, we heard, can also be a corrective balance
to Islamist leanings. On reining in the militias, we heard no good answers. Some people (Tarhouni, INC National
Security Advisor Bazama, some civil society representatives) spoke frankly about the problem, including the Islamist
leanings of the most powerful. The Islamist militias deserve more discussion in other channels, but a couple of people
noted that the Younis assassination had an upside in making scrutiny of this issue imperative. Others seemed to rely,
again, on luck or tried to avert their eyes from the problem that militias could post on the Day After. There was
widespread disdain for Qatar's role in encouraging certain militia elements, and I will be able to cite lots of concern here
when I go to Doha later. Qatar's role, too, is a subject better discussed elsewhere.
We also discussed humanitarian and financial needs. Tarhouni and Jibril noted that the TNC's financial needs increase as
more territory falls under rebel control; they are worried that, if they can't provide electricity to newly liberated towns
or fund other services there, disenchantment with the TNC will grow. Tarhouni agreed to reach out to the Indians to
discuss Libya's outstanding debts, to see if he can help us get India's hold on the frozen asset proposal lifted. Briefed on
South Africa's objections, fibril understood the need for continued outreach to Africa (although part of our South Africa
problem may derive from Jibril's poor relations with Zuma, with Jibril telling us that he recently accused Zuma of making
Nelson Mandela feel ashamed); Abdulrahman Shalgam will go to the August 25-26 AU Summit and Jibril did not rule out
attending himself. I've spoken several times to UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed since arriving here, and the
UAE has finally responded positively to our soft collateral proposal for a loan to the TNC, which may be our fastest way
of getting funds here, assuming we can come up with a letter that meets the UAE's needs and passes the scrutiny of the
U.S. interagency process.
My traveling companions, Bill Roebuck (NEA/MAG director) and Ben Fishman from the NSS, start their return trip today.
I will go on to Cairo, Doha, and Abu Dhabi, where, inter alia, I will have more Libya discussions, including seeing Jibril
again in Doha. With NileSat continuing to broadcast Qadhafi's propaganda, the Libyan anger over Egypt's role
approaches if not exceeds annoyance with Qataar. We are also checking on how to get from Cairo back here, should I
need to join Chris here in the coming days.
Chris and his tiny staff are doing a heroic job in representing our interests here. I am especially appreciative to DS for all
the work done to support my trip. I also want to highlight the work that Pat Kennedy's M family and NEA/EX did in
establiishing living and working quarters for Chris and his team. Thanks to a lot of creativity and hard work, the

Subject: FW: Benghazi update (1200 local)
Update from Rep. Stevens in Benghazi, based on largely on info from acting PM Afi Tarhouni and acting FM
Salah Bishari:
• TNC caretaker cabinet/members were up until 4am following events in Tripoli and discussing plans for
the coming days. Tarhouni said the TNC has been in constant communication with its people in Tripoli,
including both fighters and those entrusted with implementing the stabilization plans. Rebels in Tripoli,
in coordination with the TNC, have begun to set up checkpoints inside the city and guard public
buildings
• TNC chairman Abd al Jalil and PM Jibril made statements to the media last night, urging people to
refrain from revenge attacks and destruction of public buildings.
• There has so far been "no bloodbath" or serious looting.
• The capture of Saif al-Islam al-Qadhafi and Mohamed al-Qadhafi is significant. The TNC, including
Abd al-Jalil himself, intervened with rebels surrounding Mohamed's house to ensure that they did not
harm him. They understood that it would be harmful to the revolution and the TNC if he were
killed. These events were captured live by Al Jazeera in interviews with Mohamed. Both brothers are
in rebel custody (at this time, it is unclear to us exactly who is holding them, however).
• Per Tarhouni, the next steps are: 1) find Muammar Qadhafi; 2) issue a statement announcing the end of
the Qadhaii regime and the start of the interim period under the TNC (TNC staff have begun drafting
this statement already); 3) insure the delivery of essential services and commodities (esp. addressing the
acute shortages of fuel, children's milk, and medication for blood pressure and diabetes); and 4) move
the TNC to Tripoli.
• Regarding the move to Tripoli, Tarhouni said security arrangements would need to be made before they
could send the TNC leadership to the capital. We have heard from another contact that some TNC
members are already making plans to fly to Misurata and the Western Mountains, possibly as early as
today, and from there drive to Tripoli.
• Request for assistance: Tarhouni, who also holds US citizenship, said the items listed above (gas, diesel,
baby milk, and medicine) are urgently needed in Tripoli and recommended that the USG ship those
items directly to Zawiya's Port and publicize such assistance as soon as feasible (in coordination with
the TNC). Ile said this would bring the US even more goodwill than it has already earned here.

Challenger withdraws from race to unseat Afghan president
KABUL (Reuters) — One of the top candidates expected to bid to unseat Afghan President Karzai withdrew abruptly from
the election race, dealing a blow to opposition hopes of fielding a contender with a broad enough base to win.
Gul Agha Sherzai, popular governor of Nangarhar Province and a former anti-Soviet guerrilla commander, had been in
talks to head up a broad opposition ticket with two vice presidential candidates that would span ethnic lines.
But he told a news conference that he had met Karzai and had been persuaded not to run.

Iran: US journalist's case will get fair review
TEHRAN, Iran — Iran's foreign minister assured his visiting Japanese counterpart that the case of an American journalist
imprisoned in Tehran for allegedly spying for the United States will get a fair review on appeal. Foreign Minister
Manouchehr Mottaki said 32-year-old Roxana Saberi's appeal will be "reviewed justly and humanely." He spoke at a
joint news conference Saturday with Japan's Hirofumi Nakasone, who expressed concern over the case during his visit to
Iran. Saberi is a dual Iranian-American citizen who was born in Fargo, North Dakota. Her father is Iranian and her
mother is Japanese. She was arrested in January in Tehran and sentenced last month to eight years in prison after a one-
day trial behind closed doors. Her case has raised an international outcry

Clinton, in Iraq, Blames 'Rejectionists' for Violence By MARK LANDLER BAGHDAD — Secretary of State Hillary Rodham
Clinton arrived here Saturday morning for a one-day visit, delivering an American show of support for Iraq as it battles a
sudden eruption of violence, in the wake of suicide bombings that killed at least 140 people and wounded several
hundred more on Thursday and Friday.
Mrs. Clinton, in her first visit to Baghdad as secretary of state, acknowledged that the attacks were worrisome. She said
she would seek a briefing on the security situation from the American military commander, Gen. Ray Odierno, in her first
meeting on Saturday, a day packed with appointments.
But she played down suggestions that the attacks augured a return to the relentless sectarian violence that convulsed
Iraq in 2006. She said they did not signal that a new jihadist movement was taking root in Iraq, which could derail the
progress the country has made in the last two years.
"In Iraq, there will always be political conflicts," Mrs. Clinton said to reporters before setting off on the unannounced
visit Friday evening. "But I really believe that Iraq, as a whole, is on the right track."
She characterized the latest bout of violence as the last gasp of "rejectionists" who fear that the government will
succeed in creating a united and peaceful Iraq. The suicide bombings, she said, are "in an unfortunately tragic way, a
signal that the rejectionists fear that Iraq is going in the right direction."
"Are there going to be bad days? Yes, there are," Mrs. Clinton said. But she added, "If you look at the evidence,
overwhelmingly the progress that's been made has been positive."
The Obama administration, she said, was determined to help Iraq achieve "stability, sovereignty, and self-reliance," as
the United States prepares to pull out the last of its troops by the end of 2011.
Mrs. Clinton has been a regular visitor here, coming three times as a senator to chart the progress of a war she voted to
authorize, but later said had been mismanaged by the Bush administration. She said she was pleased to be back, though
the attacks have cast a shadow over her visit.
While the violence is far below the worst levels in 2006, 18 major attacks this month have kindled fears that Baathist and
jihadist elements could be reconstituting themselves into a smaller, but still deadly, insurgency that will exploit the
withdrawal of American troops between now and 2011.
Mrs. Clinton compared these latest suicide bombings to a spectacular terrorist attack that occurred several months after
the Good Friday peace accord ended years of conflict in Northern Ireland.
At times, her analysis almost echoed that of former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Defense Secretary Donald
Rumsfeld. When the sectarian violence was relentless several years ago, Mr. Cheney spoke of the insurgency being in its
"last throes," while Mr. Rumsfeld talked of "dead-enders" who kept fighting a lost cause.
On Friday, Gen. David Petraeus, the head of the military's Central Command, testified before a House appropriations
committee that the suicide bombers may have been part of a militant network based in Tunisia. Four of the bombers, he
said, were from Tunisia.
Mrs. Clinton said she did not have specific information on the bombers, but said: "We've seen suicide bombers from
many countries in Iraq over the last six years. It's unfortunate that young men, and occasionally even a young woman,
would travel to Iraq to kill other people in that way."

The violence did not seem to curtail Mrs. Clinton's ambitions for her brief visit. In addition to General Odierno, she was
scheduled to meet a retinue of Iraqi leaders, including the president, Jalal Talabani; the prime minister, Nuni Kamal al-
Maliki; and the foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari.
She is also playing host at a roundtable of Iraqi women, something she has done in previous trips to Iraq. And she is to
hold a town-hall meeting with Iraqi students, as well as members of nongovernmental organizations and provincial
reconstruction teams.
This is a format Mrs. Clinton savored as a presidential candidate, and that, as secretary of state, she has used from South
Korea to Turkey. "I want to listen," she said, "I want to respond to their questions and concerns. I want some feedback
and ideas of about how are we going to make this transition as successful as possible."
When President Obama visited Baghdad earlier this month, dusty skies prevented him from traveling by helicopter from
Baghdad International Airport into the city. He met with Mr. Maliki at a palace near the airport and General Odierno at
the American base, Camp Victory.
The new American ambassador, Christopher R. Hill, beat Mrs. Clinton to Baghdad by one day. He was confirmed by the
Senate on Tuesday after a lengthy process that was held up by Republican senators, who objected to his lack of
experience in the Arab world and his handling of negotiations with North Korea over its nuclear weapons program.
In Iraq, Mr. Hill will spearhead the shift in emphasis by the United States from military to civilian operations. Some Iraq
experts said the American civilian presence here had been lacking momentum since the departure in February of the last
United States ambassador, Ryan C. Crocker.

Clinton says Iraq on right track
BAGHDAD (AP) - U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton says this week's deadly suicide bombings in Iraq are a
sign that extremists fear the Iraqi government is succeeding.
On her first visit to Iraq as America's top diplomat, Clinton said the country has made tremendous strides despite the
recent violence and continues to deserve support as the Obama administration moves to reduce the U.S. military
presence there.
Clinton arrived in Baghdad Saturday on an unannounced trip after suicide bombings in the capital and outside killed
at least 148 people on Thursday and Friday. The attacks have exposed gaps in security as Iraq takes over from U.S. forces
in protecting the country.

Bill Clinton to be UN special envoy to Haiti: UN official
UNITED NATIONS, May 18 (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon plans to name former U.S.
President Bill Clinton as his special envoy to Haiti, U.N. officials said on Monday, in a move that could attract
investment in the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation and help stabilize the country. "The announcement is
expected to come soon," one U.N. official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. The official said a formal
announcement could come as early as Tuesday. Clinton, who has galvanized efforts to help the impoverished
Caribbean nation recover from the devastating impact of four hurricanes last year, accompanied Ban on a trip to
Haiti earlier this year. Several other diplomats confirmed the appointment of the former president, who is trying
to help Haiti through his Clinton Global Initiative foundation

Italian foreign minister cancels trip to Iran
ROME (AP) — Italy's foreign minister has canceled a planned trip to Iran for talks on regional security issues.
The Foreign Ministry in a statement Wednesday cited a problem over the meeting place with President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. It said it regretted the "lost opportunity" to discuss involving Iran in the stabilization
of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini had been scheduled to depart later Wednesday.
The communiqué made no mention of reported criticism over the planned trip, nor did it mention a missile test
conducted Wednesday by Iran with a range capable of reaching Israel and U.S. Mideast bases.

Cheryl -
I understand from Susan that you and she both received word that a decision has finally been made. We have gotten
cleared around the building this evening a package with terrific help from 10 and DRL of a press statement, talking points
and a cable notifying posts of the decision. NSC has cleared as well. We will not launch until tomorrow at 2:00.
As part of the launch plan NSC has asked that we use quotes from Secretary Clinton and Ambassador Rice in the press
statement. We would like to work with whoever is appropriate (Jake and Robert?) traveling with the Secretary to get a
one sentence quote for the statement. Jennifer Simon on our staff will email you the draft statement shortly. Please let us
know with whom we should follow up as we want to ensure we preserve the close hold nature of this process.
Thanks - Erica
(P.S. Ops has left a message for you as well from me - this is the topic - feel free to call anytime if you'd prefer
discussing).

from those who joined their ranks not out of conviction, but out of desperation. This is, in fact, the case for a majority of
those fighting with the Taliban. They should be offered an honorable form of reconciliation and reintegration into a
peaceful society if they are willing to abandon violence, break with al-Qaida, and support the constitution."

QUESTION: And on this reconciliation, bringing members of the Taliban or al-Qaida
SECRETARY CLINTON: Only the Taliban, we never said al-Qaida. We never said al-Qaida. We have no interest in any
kind of reconciliation or any rapprochement by anyone with al-Qaida.

response to her reactons and then Lissa and I could work on turning it into a real speech draft and circulate more
widely. I will also have plenty of time on my trip to work over a version that would be more suitable for Foreign Affairs,
assuming she is comfortable with the overall frame and the different pieces.

In a notice to be sent soon to State Department employees, Clinton says regulations that denied same-sex couples and
their families the same rights and privileges that straight diplomats enjoyed are "unfair and must end," as they harm U.S.
diplomacy.
"Providing training, medical care and other benefits to domestic partners promote the cohesiveness, safety and
effectiveness of our posts abroad," she says in the message, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press.
"It will also help the department attract and retain personnel in a competitive environment where domestic partner
benefits and allowances are increasingly the norm for world-class employers," she says.
"At bottom, the department will provide these benefits for both opposite-sex and same-sex domestic partners because
it is the right thing to do," Clinton says.
Among the benefits that will now be granted gay diplomats: the right of domestic partners to hold diplomatic passports,
government-paid travel for their partners and families to and from foreign posts, and the use of U.S. medical facilities
abroad.
In addition, gay diplomats' families will now be eligible for U.S. government emergency evacuations and training courses
at the Foreign Service Institute, the message says.
The announcement, expected this week, was provided to the AP by a State Department official who is a member of the
Gays and Lesbians in Foreign Affairs Agencies organization. Two department officials not affiliated with the organization
confirmed its accuracy.
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publically about the changes.

THE WHITE HOUSE
Office of the Press Secretary
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 25, 2009
STATEMENT FROM THE PRESIDENT REGARDING NORTH KOREA
Today, North Korea said that it has conducted a nuclear test in violation of international law. It appears to also have
attempted a short range missile launch. These actions, while not a surprise given its statements and actions to date, are
a matter of grave concern to all nations. North Korea's attempts to develop nuclear weapons, as well as its ballistic
missile program, constitute a threat to international peace and security.
By acting in blatant defiance of the United Nations Security Council, North Korea is directly and recklessly challenging the
international community. North Korea's behavior increases tensions and undermines stability in Northeast Asia. Such
provocations will only serve to deepen North Korea's isolation. It will not find international acceptance unless it
abandons its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.
The danger posed by North Korea's threatening activities warrants action by the international community. We have
been and will continue working with our allies and partners in the Six-Party Talks as well as other members of the U.N.
Security Council in the days ahead.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761748 Date: 06/30/2015
Purpose: To reach out to Japan, South Korea, China and Russia following the probable May 24 DPRK nuclear test.
• A nuclear test by North Korea, if confirmed, would be a provocative act and an unequivocal violation of UNSCR
1718, blatantly disregarding the will of the international community.
• We have remained united in the face of the DPRK's provocations, and we need to maintain this unity among the
Six-Party partners. The DPRK's message to us in advance of the test, which blamed the UNSC's "failure to apologize for
its Presidential Statement," demonstrates the degree to which the DPRK has isolated itself. Now is the right time for a
Five-Party meeting to demonstrate our unity.
• It is essential that the UN Security Council take strong measures to clearly demonstrate that the DPRK's actions will
have consequences. The United States believes that it is essential that the Security Council issue a swift statement
condemning the DPRK's test at its initial May 25 emergency meeting. The UNSC should then quickly follow up with a
strong new Chapter 7 Resolution that includes concrete response measures.
• [FOR TOKYO AND SEOUL] The United States remains committed to the nuclear umbrella and its obligations under
the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security and the U.S.-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty.

Sporadic gunfire was heard in the area of the blast, and troops rushed to the scene.
Television footage taken shortly after the blast showed emergency workers carrying at least one body covered
by a blanket to an ambulance, and injured bystanders mopping blood from wounds.
The blast comes as government forces are engaged in a major offensive against Taliban militants who have
seized control of the northwestern Swat Valley.

Just FYI: wanted you all to know that, for S's meeting today with Roxanne Saberi, I deferred on my own
participation in favor of the officer in the Iran office who has been doggedly working on this case for
months. Erica Thibault has been working all B6
out to get messages via the Swiss and others, working with CA and the family, etc. on this case. So if S was
wondering why I wasn't showing up, it was as a moral boost and recognition of the work Erica did on this case.

Subject: Philippine Burma Statement
Ops - Following Secretary Clinton's call on Saturday, May 16, Philippine Foreign Secretary Alberto Romulo had the
Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) issue the following statement on Sunday, May 17. The statement is on the
Philippine DFA website. Much appreciated if you would inform S staff and other appropriate folk:
Philippine Statement:
The Philippine Government is deeply troubled and outraged over the filing of trumped up charges against Daw Aung San
Suu Kyi and her transfer to Insein prison, particularly when concerns have been raised regarding her health condition.
These recent incidents will surely impede the process of national reconciliation and the Roadmap to Democracy in
Myanmar.
We urge the government of Myanmar to resolve the matter speedily, and to release Aung San Suu Kyi immediately and
unconditionally.
Regards

Times Reporter Held by Taliban Escapes
By THE NEW YORK TIMES
A New York Times reporter who was kidnapped by the Taliban has escaped and made his
way to freedom after more than seven months of captivity in the mountains of Afghanistan
and Pakistan.
David Rohde, along with a local reporter, Tahir Ludin and their driver, Asadullah Mangal,
were abducted outside of Kabul on Nov. 10 while Mr. Rohde was researching a book.
Mr. Rohde was part of the Times reporting team that won a Pulitzer Prize in May for
coverage of Afghanistan and Pakistan last year.
Mr. Rohde told his wife, Kristen Mulvihill, that Mr. Ludin joined him late Friday night in
climbing over the wall of a compound where they were being held in the North Waziristan
region of Pakistan. They found a Pakistani army scout, who led them to a nearby army
base, and on Saturday they were flown to the American Bagram military base in
Afghanistan.
"They just walked over the wall of the compound," said Ms. Muvihill.
Mr. Mangal did not escape with the two other men.
The initial report was that Mr. Rohde was in good health, while Mr. Ludin injured his foot
in the escape.

Until now, the kidnapping has been kept quiet by The Times and other media
organizations out of concern for the men's safety.
"From the early days of this ordeal, the prevailing view among David's family, experts in
kidnapping cases, officials of several governments and others we consulted was that going
public could increase the danger to David and the other hostages. The kidnappers initially
said as much," said Bill Keller, the executive editor of The Times. "We decided to respect
that advice, as we have in other kidnapping cases, and a number of other news
organizations that learned of David's plight have done the same. We are enormously
grateful for their support."
Since the men were abducted, there has been sporadic communication from them and
from the kidnappers.
Ms. Mulvihill expressed relief at the end of the ordeal and gratitude to the many people —
official and unofficial — who offered information, advice and support.
"The family is so grateful to everyone who has helped — the New York Times, the U.S.
government, all the others. Now we just hope to have a chance to reunite with him in
peace," she said.
"We've been married nine months," Ms. Mulvihill added. "And seven of those, David has
been in captivity."
Both Mr. Keller and Mr. Rohde's family declined to discuss details of the efforts to free the
captives, except to say that no ransom money was paid and no Taliban or other prisoners
were released.
"Kidnapping, tragically, is a flourishing industry in much of the world," Mr. Keller said.
"As other victims have told us, discussing your strategy just offers guidance for future
kidnappers."
Mr. Rohde, 41, had traveled to Kabul in early November to work on a book about the
history of American involvement in Afghanistan when he was invited to interview a
Taliban commander. Before setting out, Mr. Rohde instructed The Times's bureau in
Kabul on whom to notify if he did not return. He also indicated that he believed the
interview was important and that he would be all right.
Mr. Rohde joined The Times staff in 1996 after winning a Pulitzer Prize in international
reporting for documenting the massacre of Bosnian Muslims in Srebrenica.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Congressman Henry Waxman, the powerful chairman the U.S. House of Representatives
Energy and Commerce Committee, has been hospitalized in Los Angeles for an undisclosed ailment, a spokeswoman
said. The 69-year-old veteran Democrat from Southern California was not feeling well on Tuesday and was admitted to
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for "routine testing," the spokeswoman, Karen Lightfoot said. "He's feeling much better now,"
Lightfoot said. She declined to disclose the nature of his ailment or how long he is expected to remain in the hospital.
Waxman, a member of Congress since 1975, was a leading co-sponsor of landmark climate change legislation passed by
the House on Friday.

Bill Clinton to visit Haiti Monday as UN special envoy
07/02/2009 16:58
UNITED NATIONS, July 2, 2009 (AFP) - Former US president Bill Clinton will travel to Haiti Monday for his first visit as UN
special envoy to the Caribbean nation, the world body announced Thursday.
Clinton, who was appointed to the post by UN chief Ban Ki-moon last month, is to confer with government officials
"about how to best support the efforts to prepare for hurricanes, generate new jobs and enhance the delivery of basic
social services," UN spokeswoman Michele Montas told reporters.
The former US president "will also focus on how to ensure that the United Nations, civil society and the donor
community align their activities with the government's recovery plan as well as with each other," she added.
It will be Clinton's his second trip to Haiti this year.
In March, he and Ban toured Haiti together and urged the international community to continue to aid the impoverished
Caribbean country.
Clinton, who visited Haiti while president in 1995, was the first US leader to travel to the country while in office since
Franklin Roosevelt in 1934.
The former US president has sought to focus world attention on Haiti which was devastated by hurricanes last year and
is the poorest country in the western hemisphere.

Isn't a surprise since 5 years ago he removed his brother as official crown prince.
Basically he's not honoring his fathers dying wish but since constitution says it should be son (with brother as option) he
has clear authority to do it. I personally think this shows confidence in his position as he's not worried about an outcry
from his fathers loyalists.

Well he's very young, only 15.
Rumor is hes smart, quiet, bookish. Like his father.
What is interesting is that the reason abdullah gave from removing his brother 5 years ago is that he thought the weight
of being crown prince restricted his life, education and travel. I suspect the reason he's done this is so his son can be
properly groomed from now to inherit the thrown. Life will change dramatically for him.

Subject: RE: Colombian President Uribe would like to speak with the Secretary this evening
My guess is that he is calling about Honduras. He, like many other leaders with an interest in Central America, is worried
that Honduras is slipping towards confrontation and violence. He probably does not think Insulza is up to the task. S
should be aware that Arias is prepared to offer his services. I spoke with the Costa Rican FonMin, who said the de facto
government has reached out to Arias, and that the Costa Ricans will be looking for a way to make the offer to
Zelaya. Uribe knows Zelaya and has some influence. Uribe might want to talk with Arias and offer to help move Zelaya
in the right direction. (Although Uribe and Zelaya come from different ends of the political spectrum, they are both
ranchers and love horses, and this has created some comradeship.)

North Korea to move [Inter contktenta[l mOssillle: report
Fri May 29, 2009 9:40pm EDT
SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea is preparing to move an intercontinental ballistic missile from a factory near Pyongyang to
a launch site on the east coast, a South Korean newspaper quoted a source in Washington as saying on Saturday.
The factory north of Pyongyang is the same place where the North manufactured the long-range rocket it fired on April 5
before moving it to the east-coast Musudan-ri missile range for assembly and launch, the Dong-a Ilbo newspaper said.
Regional powers are waiting to see what the North might do next after it conducted a nuclear test on Monday. South
Korea is on alert on the assessment Pyongyang may make provocative moves using conventional weapons at their
heavily armed border.
North Korea has warned of an intercontinental ballistic missile test in anger over U.N. Security Council punishment of
what Pyongyang said was a satellite launch on April 5.
"Preparations to move an ICBM from the Saneum Weapons Research Center near Pyongyang by train have been
captured by U.S. spy satellites," Dong-a Ilbo quoted a source in Washington knowledgeable about the issue as saying.
The research lab is the North's main center of research and manufacture of long-range missiles, the newspaper said.
South Korea's defense ministry could not immediately comment on the report.
North Korea fired a short-range missile on Friday from the Musudan-ri missile base, South Korea's Yonhap news agency
quoted an unnamed government source as saying. The missile appeared to be a modified surface-to-air missile with a
range of up to 160 km (99 miles), Dong-a Ilbo said.
The two Koreas have fought two deadly naval clashes on their disputed maritime border in the past 10 years and the
North has warned another could happen.
U.S. Defense Department spokesman Geoff Morrell said on Friday there had been no sign of stepped-up North Korean
military activity.
But a U.S. defense official said the United States had observed "above average activity" in the past 24 hours at a site in
North Korea that has previously been used to test fire long-range missiles.
South Korea's Defense Ministry said it had seen the number of Chinese fishing boats near the peninsula in the Yellow
Sea drop sharply in recent days and is watching the North's activities for indications of aggression.

Reached out tom about your calls this morning.
He reports that the Mexicans are appreciative for the call and are energized. They are reaching out to others to try to
find a helpful solution.
Amorim called the Brazilian Ambassador here, who tom spoke to after your call. Amorim was very happy with the call,
especially the detailed discussion of possible solutions. He professed a desire to work with you to resolve this issue.
Brazil recognizes that it is being tagged as the "blocker on democratic language and wants to get out of the way. That
explains Amorim's heavy push to give this issue back to Insulza. Torn told the Brazilian Ambassador that Insulza has a big
credibility problem in our Congress, and that we, Brazil, Mexico, and others cannot walk away from the issue. This was
being relayed back to Amorim.
Among a core group of countries there is a growing realization that lack of consensus could be very damaging for the
OAS and its members. Tom thinks your calls have injected new urgency into the search for a solution.
He will be sending a classified update on the latest in a few hours. We will pouch to the house.

I am in the office and working with our Embassy in Tegucigalpa. Apparently, the action this morning was a coordinated
effort by the Supreme Court, the Honduran Congress, and the armed forces to prevent President Zelaya from holding a
non-binding poll on a possible constituent assembly. The Supreme Court determined the poll illegal and ordered the
military to collect all balloting materials. In the process of doing this, the military also seized Zelaya and supposedly sent
him by aircraft to Costa Rica.
Our Ambassador has his Emergency Action Committee convened at the Embassy. They are reaching out to all their
contacts to determine the current state of play. The Embassy will issue a warden message soon to U.S. citizens in
Honduras regarding events. I have called our Embassy in Costa Rica and asked it to confirm Zelaya's presence in San
Jose. I will be calling the Costa Rican Foreign Minister soon. Tomorrow, Costa Rica takes over as President Pro Temp of
the Central American Integration System.
Hector Morales has been in touch with OAS SecGen Insulza. The OAS Permanent Council passed a resolution on Friday
offering its good offices to Honduras to resolve the political impasse, and Insulza was going to lead a team to Honduras
on Monday. We are checking to determine the state of play of the delegation, but OAS involvement will be key to a
successful resolution of this event.
I will also be calling the new SouthCom Commander to ensure a coordinated U.S. approach. We have big military
equities in Honduras through Joint Task Force Bravo at Soto Cano airbase.
We are working up press points now. Although this morning's events were part of a larger political and institutional
struggle in Honduras. The seizure and expulsion of the President was an intolerable act by the armed forces and we are
going to have to say this loud and clear.

Spanish FM Moratinos has requested to speak with you today. Tom can give u verbal download but below are basic
points. Let me know if u want us to set up call
Points:
- We condemn the effort to remove Zelaya from office.
- We are working within the OAS and with our regional partners to resolve this situation quickly and in a manner that
restores democratic order.
°- We appreciate the role Spain played in winning quick EU condemnation of the coup attempt.
- Our work is not done. Rebuilding trust among competing political institutions and reducing polarization within
Honduras will take a lot of work. We hope Spain will work with us and the OAS to ensure a restoration of democratic
order that will allow Honduras to carry through with it electoral timetable (presidential vote scheduled for November)
Note from torn:
Aside from the statements issued by the President and the Secretary, we have been working in the OAS Permanent
Council fashioning a consensus resolution mapping out a path forward, reaching out to regional partners ( I have spoken
twice with Salvadoran President Funes, and our Ambassadors have been working with other Central American leaders),
and working within Honduras to limit the damage to Honduras institutions.

Subject: Israeli police seek fraud charges for foreign minister
JERUSALEM, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Israeli police recommended on Sunday that state prosecutors charge
Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman for bribery, fraud and money laundering. Lieberman, whose
ultranationalist Yisrael Beiteinu party is a key partner in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ruling coalition,
accused police of waging a "campaign of persecution" against him and said their allegations were
unfounded. In a statement, police said a nine-year investigation found "a basis of evidence" against Lieberman
of bribe-taking, fraud, violation of public confidence and obstruction of justice with regard to suspected money
laundering. The investigation, conducted mostly while Lieberman held other government posts, focused on the
transfer of millions of Israeli shekels to shell companies and accounts belonging to people close to him, the
statement said. Lieberman, in a statement released by his spokesman, said there was "no basis for the police
recommendation" and expressed confidence he would not be indicted. Police handed their recommendation to
state prosecutors who have to decide whether to charge Lieberman, the latest in a line of Israeli public figures to
face police questioning. Ehud Olmert was forced to resign as prime minister a year ago over a corruption
probe, though he has denied any wrongdoing. The Moldavan-born Lieberman has been denounced by Israeli
Arabs as a racist for his party's introduction of legislation to curb the liberties of citizens deemed as disloyal to
the state, moves widely seen as targeting Israel's Arab minority.

debriefing for the White House, officials said Thursday.Clinton spoke to a member of President Barack Obama's national
security council on Wednesday night, hours after flying home from negotiating the release of two jailed US journalists,
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said."We are going to get a fuller briefing," Gibbs said, adding that Obama was
also seeking to sit down with the former president to get a rare view from at the inner workings of Kim Jong-II's hermetic
political system.The White House has so far declined to detail the nature of Clinton's conversations, other than to style
the visit as a purely humanitarian mission that included no message from Obama to the leadership in Pyongyang.The
Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Clinton discussed a broad range of issues in a three-hour encounter with Kim,
and told him Pyongyang could benefit if it released kidnapped South Korean and Japanese nationals.The paper quoted a
South Korean official as saying Kim was hoping to secure the kind of direct summit with Obama that he failed to lock in
with the former president as his administration drew to a close in 2000 and 2001.A day after Obama told North Korea it
must halt provocative acts and its nuclear program, Gibbs argued that the next step in any easing of tensions must come
from Pyongyang."If they would like to see a greater international breakthrough, then they just have to come back to live
up to the responsibilities that they entered into," he said."We are going to continue to ensure that we take actions to
enforce recently passed Security Council resolutions to ensure there is not the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction."col/macUS-NKOREA-NUCLEAR-CLINTON-MEDIA-DEBRIEF - 08/06/2009 10:24 - AFP--Service: World News

EDINBURGH (AP) - Sky News and BBC television reported Wednesday that Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset
Ali al-Megrahi was to be freed from his Scottish prison on humanitarian grounds, but the minister in charge of
deciding al-Megrahi's fate denied that any such decision had been made. Neither news network cited a source
for its report. Scottish Justice Minister Kenny MacAskill, who was due to decide whether to release al-Megrahi,
told a local television station he had yet to make up his mind. A call and an e-mail sent to al-Megrahi's Scottish
lawyer were not immediately returned late Wednesday. "The decision will be made next week," MacAskill
told Scottish Television late Wednesday. Two spokeswomen for the Scotland's devolved government dismissed
the BBC and Sky reports as speculation. "Absolutely no decision has been taken on that," a spokeswoman for
the Scottish Executive said. "Categorically no decision has been made at this stage."

Well, I finally made it. Quite a start to be able to ride in with the President in AF1 and then roll into meetings with
Calderon and the leadership of the Mexican government. I will spend this week in Mexico. I will be back next week to
pack out, but will also follow up on a number of other issues while I am there.
I wanted to ask if you thought it might be possible to get a bit of time with the Secretary. There are two requests going
through the system. One is for a formal swearing in. I understand that she has one swearing in at 4:00 on Monday in
the Ben Franklin room, so one option would be if she could do the same for me in the Treaty Room at 4:30. I know this
is short notice — this has been one of those cases where planning has alluded us.

North Korea frees detained South Korea worker
By KWANG-TAE KIM (AP) – 2 hours ago
SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea has freed a South Korean worker detained for months in the communist country,
officials said Thursday, brightening prospects for improved relations on the peninsula.
The release came days after Hyundai Group Chairwoman Hyun Jung-eun traveled to Pyongyang in an effort to secure the
employee's freedom, and a week after the isolated regime freed two U.S. journalists sentenced to 12 years of hard labor
for entering the North illegally in March. That release followed a surprise visit by former President Bill Clinton, who held
talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong II.
The 44-year-old technician, surnamed Yoo, worked at an industrial zone in the North's border city of Kaesong, where
about 110 South Korean-run factories employ about 40,000 North Korean workers. He was detained in March for
allegedly denouncing the North's political system.
Though one of the few joint projects still running, the complex's viability has come under questions in recent months as
the North refused to release Yoo and demanded a massive increase in payments and recent at the industrial park. It now
has only a skeletal South Korean staff.
Unification Ministry spokeswoman Lee Jong-joo said Yoo — an employee of the Hyundai Group's North Korean business
arm, Hyundai Asan — had been released and was expected to return to South Korea later Thursday.
"It's fortunate that Yoo is returning to his family, though it's rather late," presidential spokesman Lee Dong-kwan said in
a statement. He added that the South Korean government will maintain a "consistent policy" toward North Korea.

Lee did not elaborate, but South Korean President Lee Myung-bak's government has taken a hard-line approach toward
North Korea, and the North responded by cutting off most ties and halting or curtailing key joint projects except for the
Kaesong complex.
A council made up of South Korean companies operating in Kaesong welcomed Yoo's release and expressed hope it
would "improve frozen South-North relations and revitalize" the troubled complex.
The North, however, is still holding four South Korean fishermen whose boat was seized last month after straying
accidentally into northern waters. North Korea told the South earlier Thursday that its investigation into the case is still
continuing, Unification Ministry spokesman Chun Hae-sung told reporters. No details were given.
Ahead of the news of Yoo's release Thursday, about 100 demonstrators gathered in central Seoul to demand the release
of the detained worker and the fishermen. Some burned a North Korean flag and photos of Kim.
Hyundai has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the industrial zone and a joint tourist project promoted by more
liberal South Korean governments in the past. But renewed tension between the rivals has seen a suspension of trips to
the North by South Korean tourists and a dramatic reduction in the number of South Koreans working in the industrial
zone.
The two Koreas technically remain at war since the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended in a cease-fire, not a peace treaty.
Associated Press writer Hyung-jin Kim contributed to this report.

I was granted a 40-minute prison visit with Yettaw two hours after the verdict was read. He was in surprisingly good
spirits and looked healthier than he had in a couple weeks.
He said he plans to appeal the verdict.

Subject: Senator Webb Press Comments read-out
Colleagues,
FYI, following is a read-out of Senator Webb's comments to the press August 16 in Bangkok.
• Senator Webb first delivered a prepared statement, in which he said his visit to Burma had three purposes:
1)to appeal for Yettaw's deportation;
2)to visit ASSK;
3)to ask to the Burmese leadership to end her house arrest.
• The Senator summarized the basis of his humanitarian appeal, noting Yettaw's health and stating that the
[trespassing] incident was regrettable but not mean-spirited.
• With ASSK, he said he had discussed elections and sanctions issues, but declined to characterize the content of
their conversation.
• With the leadership, he said he had raised a wide range of issues, including elections. He conveyed to the
generals that it would be hard for the world to view the Burmese elections as free and fair without the
participation of ASSK and her supporters. Asked whether free and fair elections are possible given the Burmese
constitution's structure, Webb said the constitution does not necessarily constrain elections.
• Senator Webb explained he was not a U.S. Government envoy. Asked whether his visit would trigger a review
of U.S. Burma policy, the Senator responded that Secretary Clinton had already called for a review and that he
would discuss his visit with the Secretary.
• Asked why he was received by the Burmese leadership while the UN Secretary General was not, the Senator
referred to his 18-year record of working on Southeast Asia issues and his record in Vietnam. He did not
characterize his own position on sanctions. With respect to human rights groups' fear that his visit would lend
legitimacy the regime, Webb firmly restated his qualifications and record.
• The Senator indicated that he viewed this as a possible opening for progress, but did not make any indications or
suggestions on next steps.

Mumbai gunman says he's ready for gallows
MUMBAI (AP) - The lone surviving gunman in the Mumbai attacks said he is ready to go to the gallows and wants no
mercy from the court for his role in one of India's worst terrorist acts which left 166 people dead. "Whatever I have
done, I have done in this world. It would be better to be punished in this world. It would be better than God's
punishment. That's why I have pleaded guilty," Ajmal Kasab, a Pakistani, told the court.

3 militants die on eve of Afghan presidential vote
KABUL (AP) Police stormed a bank in Kabul on Wednesday and killed three insurgents who had taken it over, while a
wave of attacks killed at least six election workers around the country on the eve of the presidential election, officials
said. The three-man assault in Kabul came a day after two militant attacks in the capital, including rockets fired at the
presidential palace. It also follows a suicide car bomb explosion in front of NATO's Kabul headquarters Saturday that
killed seven, a drumbeat of attacks that would appear to signal the intent of Taliban insurgents and their militant allies
to disrupt Thursday's vote. In a sign of how difficult election preparations have been, Afghanistan's chief electoral
officer said that 20 percent of election materials hadn't yet been delivered to voting sites less than 24 hours before polls
open at 7 a.m. Thursday (0230 GMT Thursday, 10:30 p.m. EDT Wednesday). Daoud Ali Najafi said Afghan army
helicopters would be used to,deliver the materials to insecure and hard-to-reach regions.

At least 13 die in Pakistan bus crash
ISLAMABAD (AP) Police say a bus has crashed in northwestern Pakistan killing at least 13 people and injuring 35. Police
officer Sardar Shah says the driver of the bus lost control Wednesday while driving on a mountain road, and the bus
veered into a ditch in the Batagram district of North West Frontier Province. He says three children are among the
dead. Shah blamed the accident on the driver's speeding as he went into a sharp turn on the road. Such accidents are
common in Pakistan, where roads are often poorly maintained and drivers regularly disregard traffic rules.

U.N. asks Afghanistan to lift election media ban
KABUL, Aug 19 (Reuters) - The United Nations has asked Afghanistan to lift a last-minute ban on media reporting of
violence during Thursday's presidential election, saying the Afghan constitution guaranteed a free press. Afghan
authorities imposed the ban on Tuesday with two decrees, the first barring journalists from reporting any violence in the
country between 6:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. (0130-1530 GMT) on polling day. The second ordered journalists to stay away
from the scenes of any attacks. The government says the measures are intended to prevent reports of violence from
scaring Afghans away from voting. Taliban fighters have vowed to disrupt the election. The United Nations said Afghans
had a right to information, and restricting the media could undermine confidence in the poll. "People need access to
information, not only on polling day but after polling day. The credibility of these elections is directly linked to the
information that they have access to," said Aleem Siddique, spokesman for the U.N. mission in Kabul. "Its unclear to us
what if any legal basis there would be for such a directive when Afghanistan's constitution guarantees freedom of
expression and freedom of the press. We are making this point to the Afghan authorities," he said on
Wednesday. Afghan police have taken a more aggressive attitude towards reporters in recent days. Several journalists
were beaten by police at the scene of a suicide car bombing on Tuesday and a siege with gunmen on Wednesday.

The Secretary's Call Sheet for
Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari
Purpose of Call: To express your condolences regarding the deaths of Iraqi MFA personnel in the August 19 attack on
the Iraqi Foreign Ministry.
MI want to personally express my heartfelt condolences to you for the savage attack on the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign
Affairs today and for the tragic loss of so many Iraqi lives around Baghdad and particularly at the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs.
al I remember fondly our meeting at the MFA in April — I was proud to be the first senior U.S. official to attend a meeting
there, and I was deeply saddened to hear that your Ministry was attacked.
DI This is a trying day for Iraqis and the Government of Iraq, but brutal attacks like these only deepen the need for
dedicated Iraqi like you and those in your Ministry, to remain committed to the new Iraq.
1:11 Know that the United States will continue to stand by Iraq as it faces these challenges.
Background: On Wednesday, August 19, what appears to be a series of VBIED and additional rocket attacks in Baghdad
resulted in the bloodiest day in Baghdad since the June 30 withdrawal of U.S. forces from urban areas. Although exact
numbers have not been confirmed, media is reporting that approximately 75 people were killed across Baghdad with
over 100 injuries. The most devastating attack appears to have been against the Iraqi MFA, where a VBIED was
exploded in front of the main gate. Zebari's Chief of Staff estimated that there were 35-40 fatalities and up to 40
injuries resulting from this attack, with 70% of the building damaged. In April, you were the first senior U.S. official to
hold a meeting at the MFA. Deputy Foreign Minister Labid Abbawi, who attended your meeting at the MFA and who's
wife led your meeting with Iraqi war widows, was reportedly slightly injured and quite shaken by the attack. He may
have lost a number of staff members. At this point, we do not know if other senior-ranking MFA officials were killed or
wounded in the attack.

Scots to rule soon on Lockerbie bomber -lawmaker
LONDON, Aug 19 (Reuters) - A decision by the Scottish government whether to release a Libyan convicted of the 1988
Lockerbie bombing may be announced as early as Thursday, a legislator said on Wednesday. Christine Grahame, a
member of the Scottish Parliament who has campaigned against the conviction, said she expected former Libyan
intelligence agent Abdel Basset al-Megrahi to be freed early on compassionate grounds because he has terminal
cancer. The regional administration has come under pressure from the United States to keep Megrahi in jail, while a
British government minister said the wait for news was "becoming embarrassing". "I don't think it will be long coming,"
Grahame told BBC radio. "I suspect we might have something maybe tomorrow (Thursday) morning. We will probably go
for compassionate release. It avoids a lot of difficulties." Scotland's Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill is considering two
requests from Megrahi to be released early, on compassionate grounds or under a prisoner transfer agreement (PTA)
between Britain and Libya.

The Secretary's Call Sheet for
Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari
Purpose of Call: To express your condolences regarding the deaths of Iraqi MFA personnel in the August 19 attack on
the Iraqi Foreign Ministry.
GI I want to personally express my heartfelt condolences to you for the savage attack on the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign
Affairs today and for the tragic loss of so many Iraqi lives around Baghdad and particularly at the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs.
El I remember fondly our meeting at the MFA in April — I was proud to be the first senior U.S. official to attend a meeting
there, and I was deeply saddened to hear that your Ministry was attacked.
111This is a trying day for Iraqis and the Government of Iraq, but brutal attacks like these only deepen the need for
dedicated Iraqi like you and those in your Ministry, to remain committed to the new Iraq.
I Know that the United States will continue to stand by Iraq as it faces these challenges.
Background: On Wednesday, August 19, what appears to be a series of VBIED and additional rocket attacks in Baghdad
resulted in the bloodiest day in Baghdad since the June 30 withdrawal of U.S. forces from urban areas. Although exact
numbers have not been confirmed, media is reporting that approximately 75 people were killed across Baghdad with
over 100 injuries. The most devastating attack appears to have been against the Iraqi MFA, where a VBIED was
exploded in front of the main gate. Zebari's Chief of Staff estimated that there were 35-40 fatalities and up to 40
injuries resulting from this attack, with 70% of the building damaged. In April, you were the first senior U.S. official to
hold a meeting at the MFA. Deputy Foreign Minister Labid Abbawi, who attended your meeting at the MFA and who's

have lost a number of staff members. At this point, we do not know if other senior-ranking MFA officials were killed or

Pakistan PM effectively rules out treason charges
ISLAMABAD (AP) Pakistan's prime minister on Wednesday effectively ruled out bringing treason charges against the
country's former military ruler, Pervez Musharraf. Pakistan's Supreme Court recently ruled that Musharraf's imposition
of a state of emergency in 2007 was unconstitutional a decision that raised the possibility he could be accused of
treason. But Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani had said such charges would only be brought against Musharraf if
Parliament passed a unanimous resolution requesting them. Speaking in Parliament on Wednesday night, Gilani said the
opposition parties did not have enough votes to pass the resolution indicating his own party would not vote in favor.

Secretary Clinton —
I understand you are going to Kenya next week and while I know the trip is primarily focused on trade issues, I
wanted to flag an issue for you because I know it is near and dear to your heart.
Kenya has one of the strictest anti-abortion laws in Africa — it is illegal unless a woman's life is at risk and
criminalizes both the woman and the provider. Two years ago, Kenyan authorities imprisoned a doctor and
two nurses, falsely accusing them of providing illegal abortions. After a year in prison, the providers were
found innocent and released, but it galvanized the legal and provider community who formed a coalition to
make abortion less restrictive. It will come as no surprise to you that, as a result of their abortion law, Kenya
has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in all of Africa, with an estimated 800 women a day seeking
the procedure, often through dangerous means.
Kenya is restarting a long-stalled constitutional review process and they hope to produce a final Constitution
by next year. Religious groups are on a concerted crusade to include new language in the Constitution which
would codify that "life begins at conception". The current Constitution is largely silent on the issue. If this fetal
personhood amendment goes forward, it would place Kenya in the small community of nations with such a
provision. It would clearly mark Kenya as out of stop with countries attempting to institutionalize the African
Union's Maputo Protocol, one of the most progressive regional documents on women, development and
reproductive rights, and with the vast majority of African countries in general. For a country trying to regain
the momentum of stability and success it enjoyed until recently, such a policy imposition would be a
regression for women's rights and for the country writ large.
I went to Kenya last month to work with the coalition that has formed to strategize against the Constitutional
amendment and to work toward a less restrictive abortion law. I also visited several of our clinics and
providers in Nairobi and in nearby villages where Planned Parenthood has programs to train providers in post
abortion care. You have seen this a million times in your travels around the world, so I don't need to tell you
how poignant the stories were of the lives saved and lost, the bravery in standing up to constant government
harassment, and the fear of what this potential Constitutional amendment will mean to the provision of safe
medical services. I know it is asking a lot, but if there is any way that you could draw attention to this issue
when you are in Kenya, you would be even more of my personal hero than you already are. It is our hope that

if Kenya knows the world is watching they may be more careful in how they proceed. Of course we would be
happy to help you in any way if you decide you want to do something on this while you are there. There is also
a Congressional delegation going to Kenya the week of August 8th and we are working on them to have a side
meeting on this issue as well.

N-M: Yes, I can hear you but the line is very poor
5: I wanted to reach out to you today. I hope you're doing well
N-M: Thank you. I wanted to come to New York, but it was impossible....
S: I wanted to talk with you about the Human Rights Council.. I think as you know, we decided to join it so that we
could be actively involved and would be able to solve some of these issues. We have been working very closely with the
Egypt and the OIC on resolution for freedom of expression. We have agreement and then at last minute we were told
that saw wanted to change the wording which would break down consensus. Can we avoid this?
N-M: We will do whatever we can to keep our good relations. We are already happy about the way things have been so
far. On the issue, we totally agree with you, and thank you for the call. We fully agree with you but we must not block
the passing of the resolution;
S: Could I call you right back? I understand the concern that your delegation expressed about offensive speech is one
that others share. There is a separate consideration going on about that. We had hoped with Egypt as partner we could
to have a strong resolution and then we could get back to the other issues.
N-M: Therefore it must be allowed to and then whatever we must allow the resolution to be passed. For that it must
be allowed to pass without the vote.
S: What I would like to do is to understand whether there is a way we could allow this agreed upon language to go
forward, and then work together on your concerns. Is that possible?

N-M: I was saying to you that we are elated that you are backing the HRC, and we appreciate the amount of work you

resolution. Hate speech was one of the issues of apartheid, the issue around hate is protected by our
constitution... ...the work you have undertaken... We want the resolution to go through. We do appreciate the work
you are doing. On the whole, the issue of the hate language is quite sentimental and has been protected in our
constitution because of where we come from.
5: I understand the importance. If you would work with us to allow us to pass the resolution that is currently pending,
then we could work with you to focus on the areas of hate speech. That would have a combined impact to make it
powerful. What we've done with Egypt and the OIC is a first, and when we heard that South Africa would not pass the
resolution, we were worried that it would undermine the efforts that we're making on the Human Rights Council.
N-M: If it can go through without the vote. It's our constitution and our history, that we take the issue about hate
speech very seriously. I'm agreeing with you now, to find a way to have the resolution go through, without the vote
S: There are a number of things I want to talk with you about this was most urgent. I will report that back. I appreciate
the cooperation. Let's schedule a call in the next week to go over other issues.
N-M: Let's talk again in the next week.

o The goal is clear: to bring an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and to resolve the open disputes
and claims between the parties, including the territorial and security issues addressed by UN Security Council
Resolution 242 and 338, by reaching realistic, effective, and enduring agreements and arrangements which will
enable two states to live side by side in peace and security—the state of Israel with secure and recognized
borders and an independent and territorially and economically viable Palestinian state. Without prejudice to
the location of borders, the land being discussed is the territory occupied in 1967.
• It is understood that this will be achieved through direct bilateral negotiations which will resolve
previously identified issues such as security, borders, settlements, refugees, Jerusalem, relations, and
cooperation with other neighbors as well as other issues of common interest. The U.S. will play an active and
sustained role in supporting the parties in this effort. The parties will need to: agree on the conduct of the
negotiations, reach the necessary agreements and arrangements, and ultimately attain their long awaited mutual
reconciliation.

On Friday morning the UN HRC adopted the Freedom of Expression resolution by consensus.
The U.S.-Egyptian joint resolution is another step on the long road to bridging divides at the HRC. It is an example of U.S.
diplomacy, working with others in a multilaterral setting following the Cairo speech and reinforces the Administration's
decision to join the HRC.

KHARTOUM, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Sudan must swiftly approve a budget to pay for elections in April and speed up
preparations if the vote is to go ahead on time, the U.S.-based Carter Center which will monitor the ballot said on
Thursday. The votes for the presidency, parliament and other bodies is part of the democratic transformation promised
in the 2005 peace deal that ended a north-south civil war that lasted two decades. They will be the first multi-party
elections in over 20 years. "The Center reported serious concerns about slippage in the overall electoral calendar," a
report said, adding the organization was also worried about new laws and continued restrictions on civil liberties. "(It is
an) ambitious schedule but will only be viable if the government of national unity and the NEC (National Elections
Commission) take immediate action to ensure that further delays are avoided," the report said.

Russia to help Ecuador develop nuclear energy
QUITO (Reuters) - Russia will help Ecuador develop a nuclear energy program for peaceful purposes according to a new
energy cooperation agreement between the two countries, the Ecuadorean government said Thursday. "Yesterday the
ministry of electricity and renewable energy signed a memorandum of understanding with the Russian State Atomic
Energy Corporation (Rosatom) ... to carry out research in technologies and nuclear devices that may effectively be used
in our country," the ministry said in a statement. The ministry said that Rosatom would provide "support and
assistance" to help Ecuador draft a set of laws that will limit the use of nuclear energy to peaceful purposes only. The
statement says the deal calls for the governments of the two countries to appoint a team that would identify "the most
interesting projects to develop a nuclear industry" in the Andean country.

Low turnout seen in Afghan election; 26 killed
KABUL (AP) Millions of Afghans defied threats Thursday to cast ballots in the country's second national elections since
Taliban rule, but turnout appeared weaker this time because of continuing violence, fear and disenchantment. In much
of the Taliban's southern strongholds, many people did not dare to vote, bolstering the hopes of President Hamid
Karzai's chief rival. At least 26 people were killed in election-related violence, fewer than had been feared. Officials
began counting millions of ballots as soon as the polls closed at 5 p.m. after a one-hour extension. First preliminary
results weren't expected for several days, and some major candidates were already alleging fraud. A top election
official, Zekria Barakzai, told The Associated Press that he estimated 40 to 50 percent of the country's 15 million
registered voters cast ballots far lower than the 70 percent who voted in the presidential election in 2004.

Subject: CORRECT UPDATED VERSION FOR S -- NOTE ON MOBILE INITIATIVES
All,
Yesterday Secretary Clinton asked for our Mobile Initiatives update (this would have been a part of one of the
presentations in the Af/Pak session but was canceled due to time).
Sean Misko may have sent an old version up, but this is the one reviewed by Holbrooke that should go to S. It also
includes a significant update on our mobile banking programs that was not in the original draft.
Please pass this to the Secretary. Also attached are a memo on the cell phone expansion by ISAF — which was started by
Ashley Bommer's initiatives -- in the spring and an economist report on mobile technologies in emerging markets that
features the key Afghan telecom partner whose mobile payment program is described in the memo.
Best,
Vikram

Subject: Juba Update
Secretary Clinton, greetings from Juba, Southern Sudan, where we've just held our latest round of trilateral
talks between the Southern People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) and National Congress Party (NCP),
facilitated by the United States. This update outlines the outcomes of our trilateral and bilateral discussions,
and highlights of the some important issues that will influence our planning in the months ahead. In addition,
I'll pass on some impressions from my visit to the Kenana Sugar Factory that illustrates why I believe we need
smarter sanctions for Sudan.
SPLM and NCP Agreement
Yesterday I witnessed the initialing of a bilateral agreement between the SPLM and NCP, in which the parties
laid out points of agreement on ten of the twelve major outstanding issues in the Comprehensive Peace
Agreement (CPA). Culminating three months of negotiations, this agreement documents a shared vision for
implementing the Abyei arbitration decision, for moving forward on border demarcation, for completing legal
reforms, and for resolving other key issues. If the parties match their words with actions, it will bring them
closer to full CPA implementation and to peaceful coexistence. To ensure implementation, we have backed up
the agreement with timelines and a stoplight chart that we will use to hold both parties accountable to their
words.
With this agreement, we can now turn our full attention to resolving the electoral census and the referenda
for self-determination. We will resume our trilateral talks in Juba in early September. These two issues are
the most controversial and potentially destabilizing challenges facing Sudan. It appears likely that we will
ultimately have to raise these politically sensitive issues to the level of the Presidency (President Bashir, Vice
President Kiir, and Vice President Taha) to reach final agreement. I will keep you posted on my discussions
and the potential for meetings at the Presidency-level in Khartoum or Juba.
Looming NCP-SPLM Dilemma
1^1A
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764258 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764258 Date: 07/31/2015
As the clock ticks down to the April 2010 national elections and the January 2011 referenda on self-
determination for Southern Sudan and Abyei, both parties have begun the process of negotiating and defining
the path forward to accomplish their highest priorities. The NCP's focus is on holding onto power and
controlling the levers of power in Khartoum. In this spirit, the NCP has reached out to the SPLM with an offer
of a strategic partnership that would bring the two parties together through the elections (in an electoral
alliance that guarantees the election of Bashir in Khartoum and Kiir in Juba). This alliance will also clear the
way to implement remaining CPA milestones and to resolve referenda issues. However, the NCP will not let
the South go quietly under any scenario. The price of a smooth path to the referenda will be an SPLM
commitment to unity, to include Southern Sudan's vocal support for a unified nation.
This puts the SPLM in an extremely difficult position. While the SPLM is united in the view that getting to the
referenda is their most important objective, asking them to take a position on unity versus separation
accentuates a divide that runs deep within the SPLM. For a small core of SPLM who are loyal to the original
"New Sudan" vision of John Garang, unity has always been a more attractive option—but not without the
fundamental democratic transformation envisioned by the CPA. For an increasingly large portion of the SPLM,
separation has become a more attractive option despite the risks; this side of the party seeks to be in sync
with the vast majority of the Southern population who are expected to vote for independence. The path to
the referenda will be extremely difficult even under the best case scenario. I believe that separation of the
South will require very significant political, economic, and possible security investments by the United
States. Providing this assistance proactively will be a lot cheaper and easier than waiting until we must react.
The Future of Southern Sudan
No matter how this strategic dilemma is resolved and which path is taken to the referenda, all indicators
suggest that Southerners will vote for independence in January 2011, creating the first new nation in Africa in
more than two decades. Unlike other recent examples of independence, such as East Timor and Kosovo,
Southern Sudan will not have a long transition period after its vote for independence to prepare itself—indeed
it could have as little as six months from the referenda to the day independence is declared. During this
period, the government would have to undertake milestones such as establishing a central banking system,
issuing new national currency, and setting up commercial banking. The new government would also have to
determine the division of assets between North and South, and gain membership in the international financial
institutions (e.g., IMF and World Bank) to qualify for financial assistance and debt relief. This are just the
monetary policy issues! The South will be born facing serious internal and external security threats, weak
governance, and a grave financial situation—we must begin now to prepare both Southern Sudan and the
United States for this outcome. Our historic relationship with Southern Sudan gives us a special opportunity
to help guide the future of this fragile state, but also a unique responsibility to ensure its viability and its
success.
To meet these expectations, we have begun to develop a bilateral partnership framework with the SPLM to
outline what the United States expects from the Government of Southern Sudan (GoSS) and the SPLM and
what they expect of us. In these talks and in my meeting with President of Southern Sudan Salva Kiir, we
discussed how the United States could work with the GoSS to help strengthen its governing capacity, assist
with internal security and regional stability, and pursue economic development. As part of the bilateral
partnership, we expect the GoSS/SPLM to complete its responsibilities under the CPA, to pursue good
governance practices and fiscal transparency, and to support the United States and the international
community in promoting security and stability in Darfur and the rest of the country. To meet the South's
needs, I believe we need to focus on three areas: 1) transitioning from development assistance to large-scale
nation building, 2) instituting "smart" sanctions, and 3) strengthening security assistance to the South. While
US development and security assistance projects have increased capacity in Southern Sudan, these activities

have not transformed the South enough to ensure its success in the post-referenda period. We will reevaluate
the level of assistance that we provide to the South and will review ongoing projects to ensure we're doing
everything we can to prepare for the likely independence in 23 months.
The need for smarter sanctions was reinforced during my visit to the Kenana Sugar Company in Northern
Sudan, one of the largest integrated sugar companies in the world. I was impressed not only by the scale of
sugar production at Kenana, but also by its scope. Kenana engineers use byproducts of the sugar-refining
process to produce commercially viable commodities, ranging from animal feed to ethanol. We also visited a
school and a hospital catering to Kenana's permanent staff of over 4600. The staff and their families receive
free housing, electricity, clean water, medical care, and education. From my perspective, Kenana is a model
for securing foreign exchange and stimulating sustainable economic development. This plant provides long-
term employment opportunities that could be replicated throughout Sudan. While still maintaining pressure
on the Government of Sudan in Khartoum, I believe we could assist the people of Sudan by:
In addition to these fixes that apply between now and 2011, we must soon begin to undertake a
comprehensive review of our legal and policy guidelines regarding foreign assistance spending and economic
relationships to ensure that the South is born unencumbered from the restrictions we have placed on Sudan.
My trip will continue in Addis Ababa and Cairo to coordinate efforts to reunify Darfuri rebels and to promote
the Darfur peace process. When I return, I would welcome the opportunity to brief you further on these
issues prior to the upcoming Principals Committee meeting. I would very much value your insights on the best
path forward. Very respectfully, Scott

Fw: (WSJ)- German government awaits outcome of GM board of directors meeting
From: Morgan, Jack A
To: NEWS-Mahogany
Cc: SES-O_Shift-II
Sent: Fri Aug 21 11:45:21 2009
Subject: (WSJ)- German government awaits outcome of GM board of directors meeting
BERLIN (Dow Jones)--The German government is awaiting the outcome of a meeting of General Motors Co.'s board of
directors later Friday that will discuss the sale of its German unit Adam Opel GmbH.
The government will then assess what it believes will be a fundamental signal on which of the two remaining bids for the
unit the company favors, economics ministry spokeswoman Beatrix Brodkorb said Friday.
The meeting is due to take place in the afternoon, central European time, according to the government.
Austrian-Canadian car parts maker Magna International Inc. (MGA), in a consortium with Russian savings banks OAO
Sberbank (SBER.RS), and Belgian private equity firm RHJ International SA (RHJI.BT) have recently presented revised
bids for Opel and its sister company, U.K.-based Vauxhall.
Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is keen to rescue jobs at Opel ahead of the Sept. 27 general election, has
lobbied hard for Magna to be win the bid, while GM in the past has preferred RHJ.
Government spokesman Klaus Vater said Friday that there is currently "some movement," and Brodkorb said the
government has been in contact with the U.S. on Opel over the past 24 hours.
Brodkorb stressed that Germany's offer to provide the entire EUR4.5 billion in state aid for Opel came after GM asked
Germany to provide more details on aid for the Magna bid but made no request for more state aid details for RHJ.
The offer to pay state subsidies entirely and upfront without other European countries that have Opel and Vauxhall plants
"is an offer to other countries to help get a fast decision," Brodkorb said.
Other European countries with Opel plants include Spain, the U.K., Poland and Belgium.
The U.K. government is reportedly irritated by Germany's offer to entirely shoulder state guarantees of up to EUR4.5
billion in the deal because a decision on state aid wouldn't be up to Germany alone since the Opel bids also involve
Vauxhall and production sites in Spain and Poland.
Opel has around 50,000 staff in Europe, of which around half are based in Germany.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who is bidding to oust Angela Merkel as
chancellor of Germany in September's election, said he wanted a timetable for a military pull-out from
Afghanistan. Steinmeier said once it became clear who would lead Afghanistan after the election there, talks should
begin over how long foreign troops should stay. "We need to agree with the new Afghan president...how long
international troops should remain in Afghanistan," he said at the sidelines of an election event in Dortmund on
Saturday.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) An official says South Korea's president is meeting a visiting high-level delegation from North
Korea amid signs of warming ties on the divided peninsula. A presidential Blue House official says talks between
President Lee Myung-bak and the delegation from Pyongyang are being held at the president's office Sunday morning.
The North Korean delegation flew to Seoul on Friday to pay respects to former President Kim Dae-jung who died last
week. Their visit provided a rare opportunity for dialogue between the two Koreas, whose relations have been largely
frozen since Lee took office last year with a tougher line on the North. Speaking on condition of anonymity citing
government policy the official says she could not provide further details.

Jim, Cheryl and Bill:
We have a Congressional issue that is moving a bit too slowly through the building that you should know
about. Rep. Steve Rothman (D-NJ) and Senator Lautenberg have contacted us alarmed by the news that
Qaddafi will come to UNGA and allegedly overnight at the residence of the Libyan PermRep in
Englewood.. Rothman has called our office directly and threatened holy war and Fox news "if the State
Department allows this." A few minutes ago we also got a letter from Sen. Lautenberg to the Secretary
expressing similar concerns. The anger is of course over the "hero's welcome" for Megrahi. An action memo
for Jim to consider on how to deal with Qaddafi's visit is in the works, but I fear Rothman will head for the
microphones before Jim gets the memo.

the Korean War, Seoul officials said, the first such dialogue in nearly two years. North Korea accepted
South Korea's proposal to hold the three-day talks starting Wednesday at the North's Mount Kumgang

Oops my email acting up.
Eap is asking you to call Thai foreign minister kasit regarding the case of the russian arms dealer viktor bout. Are you ok
doing this call in the next day or so?
Below is call sheet and I also faxed to the house.
Purpose of Call: To underscore the importance we place on a the Royal Thai Government's successful appeal of the
court decision rejecting the extradition of Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout to the United States and the importance of
his continued detention pending the outcome of the appeal.
Background: On August 11, 2009, a Thai judge denied a U.S. extradition request of accused arms smuggler Viktor Bout
(pron: BOOT) to face trial in New York for conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals and officers; acquire and use anti-aircraft
missiles; and provide material support to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The Thai Attorney
General's Office will appeal the ruling. FM Kasit has been a strong ally on Burma and released a forward-leaning
Chairman's statement on behalf of ASEAN following ASSK's conviction.

Sensitive But Unclassified
UNASUR Letter on Colombia
• Cheryl and Jim said they both thought that there were things missing from the latest WHA draft of a letter from
the Secretary to UNASUR members. The goal is to get the final version to the Secretary as soon as possible.
Mitchell meeting with Netanvahu
• Cheryl noted that the Secretary will receive a readout from Senator Mitchell on his meeting with Prime Minister
Netanyahu shortly.
Libya
• Bill reported that Jeff Feltman has not heard back definitively on Qaddafi's decision about staying in New Jersey
during UNGA. Pat Kennedy said he had talked to USUN about possibly allowing Qaddafi to pitch his tent in Fort
Hamilton in Brooklyn. Mike Polt noted that he had spoken to Congressman Rothman twice yesterday, and that
Rothman expressed hope we would have a definitive answer from the Libyans by Sunday, when the Rabbi in
Englewood, N.J. plans a protest at the Libyan Residence.
H1N1
• Pat said he had received a call from John Brennan thanking State for providing data on H1N1 outbreaks in the
Southern Hemisphere and asking relevant desks to let their embassies know that the USG would be issuing a
report on this.
Honduras
• Harold said he had signed off on an action memo to the Secretary along with WHA and F regarding restrictions
on assistance to Honduras. (I subsequently confirmed that the package has not yet come forward to the Line -
it is awaiting WHA front office clearance and Jim Steinberg's final approval.)
• Derek Chollet said that S/P has drafted the options memo for the Secretary on the upcoming Presidential
election in Honduras.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764544 Date: 07/31/2015
• Ian said he anticipated questions on Qaddafi and UNGA, Senator Mitchell's meeting with PM Netanyahu, and
the results of the delegation to Honduras. He noted in this regard that the decision to suspend NIV issuances in
Honduras attracted relatively little attention, but any decision with respect to a possible cut off in assistance
would attract a great deal more.
• Ian noted that CNN is running with a story based apparently on a State IG report faulting the Department for
being slow in planning for the safety and effectiveness of U.S. civilians in Iraq in the wake of the U.S. military
withdrawal. Pat said he thought this was based on an old IG report. Jim said that our line should be that we are
confronting the implications of the military withdrawal, that we have an elaborate planning process in place,
and that we are focused heavily on the safety and security of remaining USG employees.
• PJ noted that the Secretary will issue a statement on Senator Kennedy's death, and that Senator Mitchell also
would putout a message in his capacity as a former Senate colleague.
• Finally, PJ reported that ABC has not yet given up on the story related to a Soviet-style effort by the Russians to
entrap/smear a Department employee in Moscow. (The incident in question stems from the time the employee
did not work for the Department, but was studying Russian language in Vladivostok.) We are trying to convince
ABC that this is not a story and if there is a story, it is that the Russians continue to use old techniques to try to
entrap our employees.

This is kennedy statement about to go out. Will be joint from u and wjc.
Senator Ted Kennedy was one of the most important and influential leaders of our time, whose five decades as Senator
from Massachusetts helped to shape America's history and chart our shared future. During our time in the White
House, we were thankful for his fierce advocacy and support for universal health care and his work to provide health
coverage to low-income children. Without his tireless efforts, America would not be as close to achieving health care
reform as we are today.Continuing the legacy left by his older brothers, his lifelong pursuit of civil rights and justice for
all moved America forward to form a more perfect union. But beyond his death, his legacy of public service will live on in
millions of young people across our nation who now have the chance to serve through the Edward M. Kennedy Serve
America Act, which will expand AmeriCorps and other youth service opportunities. He loved his country, his wife Vicki,
and his incredible children and grandchildren. We are proud to have known him, worked alongside him, and called him
our friend. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and the people of Massachusetts during this difficult time.

Ban really wants to do this w me but he cannot do it at 3:30 on the 24th because he has to go to P'burgh. He asked that
we work w Bob Orr on his staff to find another time if possible. We should try to do that asap. He doesn't leave NY until
afternoon of 24th so possible to do in morning. He returns late afternoon on 25th. What can we work out? If all else
fails, work w Orr to get the right representative.

Top Russian official: no missiles near Poland
MOSCOW (AP)-A Russian deputy defense minister has confirmed that the military has scrapped a plan to deploy missiles
near Poland. Vladimir Popovkin says that U.S. President Barack Obama's decision to dump the Bush-era plan to deploy
missile defense sites in Eastern Europe has made the deployment of Iskander short-range missiles in Russia's Kaliningrad
region unnecessary. Popovkin's statement on Ekho Moskvy radio Saturday confirmed previous similar statements by
other Russian officials.

Nalbandian statement: "The Turkish side is informed and we are confident that they realize that we exclude the
conditioning of the normalization of Turkish-Armenian relations on steps toward the settlement of the Karabakh
conflict. Trying to link these two processes could lead to the failure of both. A number of countries, including
those of the Minsk Group Co-Chairs, have the same position. They have said many times that the normalization
of relations between Turkey and Armenia must be without preconditions. With this mutual understanding, we
have started and conducted negotiations and come to agreements that are reflected in the initialed protocols. If
the Turkish leadership has problems with the signing of these documents, they should not try to solve them by
distorting the spirit, essence, and goals of the initialed documents. The signing and implementation of the
agreed documents is a process that is full of difficulties. Nevertheless, Armenia is ready to respect the
agreements and move forward If the current authorities in Turkey are not ready to accept the fact of the
genocide perpetrated in the Ottoman Empire, then they are at least obliged to show respect toward the
survivors of the Armenian genocide and their descendants."
Huma can you make sure S sees this before calls.
Erdogan quote: "Until the Karabakh issue is solved we cannot open the border. We have told them that
already. We cannot open the border until the Azerbaijani Armenian conflict is overcome. There are frequent
meetings of Aliyev-Medvedev-Sargsian. We are much closer to a Karabakh solution. Without that issue being
resolved, it is impossible for our side to take this step. Armenia must free itself of being led by the
diaspora. Armenia doesn't get any benefit from the diaspora. The diaspora scores points by using
Armenia. That's what it does. The diaspora in the U.S. and France does this."

PARIS (AP) EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner is withdrawing her candidacy for the top job at
the United Nations agency for culture and education. Paris-based UNESCO is choosing a new director in voting that
began Thursday and continues Monday. Austrian Ferrero-Waldner was considered a strong candidate. The front-runner
is Egyptian Farouk Hosni, opposed by Jewish activists. He threatened last year to burn Israeli books, but later
apologized. The Austrian Foreign Ministry announced Sunday that Ferrero-Waldner was withdrawing "for the greater
good of the organization and European unity," and urged respect for UNESCO's ideals. Other candidates are former
Bulgarian foreign minister Irina Bokova and Ecuadorean diplomat Ivonne Baki.

Don't think oscar was able to get this to you before you left. Its a few ny notes from chris falvo before the school event:
TO: Secretary Clinton
FROM: Chris Falvo
DATE: September 8, 2009
RE: NY Local Issues
Schools - NYC public schools open on Wednesday, September 9th. As a result, you will be visiting a charter school that
opened a couple of weeks ago instead of a public school. Mike Mulgrew, who took over as President of the UFT when
Randi left for AFT, will be present at the event and should be acknowledged in your remarks. His aides who you have
met numerous times, Dick Riley and Bridget Rein, will also be present. Mike appointed Dick as his press secretary last
month.
H1N1 - Mayor Bloomberg did a rollout earlier this week on NYC's plans to handle this health concern, and a significant
portion discusses schools. Unlike what was done in the Spring, this time closing schools will be a last resort. Reason is
that they found kids still contaminate each other by going to movies and playgrounds when the schools are closed, so
instead they are asking sick kids to stay home.
And if four percent of a student body experiences the flu on a single day, a doctor will visit to monitor the situation.
Every student in a NYC school will be offered free H1N1 flu shots or mist once a vaccine is available.
Primary day - September 15th is primary day. In addition to Bill Thompson for Mayor, the primary races that have been
closely followed are Public Advocate and City Comptroller. Running for Public Advocate are Councilmember Eric Gioia,
Councilmember Bill DeBlasio, former Public Advocate Mark Green, and civil rights lawyer Norman Siegel. Running for
Comptroller are four Councilmembers: John Lui, Melinda Katz, David Yassky, and David Weprin.
Rangel - As of last week House Speaker Pelosi plans to allow Rep. Rangel to keep his chairmanship of the Ways and
Means Committee despite his ethics problems. According to amended forms recently filed with the House, Rangel failed
to disclose at least $800,000 in assets and income since 2002. This comes amid a House ethics investigation into his
failure to report income from and pay taxes on a villa in the Dominican Republic and his ties to a real-estate developer
who leased him four rent-stabilized apartments in New York. The panel is also looking into Rangel's fundraising and
whether he improperly used his office to raise money for a public policy center in his name at the City University of New
York. Rangel has denied any wrongdoing and says its accounting mistakes and simple oversights. The NY Post and
Buffalo News have called for his resignation. Speaking at a health-care forum in Washington Heights last Tuesday, Rangel
said that bias and prejudice toward Obama are fueling opposition to health-care reform. "Some Americans have not
gotten over the fact that Obama is president of the United States. They go to sleep wondering, 'How did this happen?' "
Rangel said. Rangel then likened the battle over health-care expansion for the uninsured to the fight for civil rights.
"Why do we have to wait for the right to vote? Why can't we get what God has given us? That is the right to live as
human beings and not negotiate with white southerners and not count the votes. Just do the right thing," he said. After
the forum, Rangel insisted he was not smearing opponents as racists. "What I'm saying is, if you watch the town-hall
meetings, people were angry and did not care what the answer was to some of their questions. They were angry with
their member of Congress, period," he said. Rangel's comments came less than two weeks after Governor Paterson
claimed he has been the victim of a racist white media -- and also suggested that opposition to Obama's plan is racially
driven. The White House disagreed with Paterson's comments.

Huma, Joe, Jake,
We are likely to have one candidate against Hosni in round 4 of the UNESCO director general race on Monday.
EU Commissioner Ferraro-Waldner has pulled out formally.
Our UNESCO Amb. Killion reports that candidates Baki (Ecuador) and Bukova (Bulgaria) met Sunday night Paris time.
Baki has given Bukova an ultimatum. Either they form a unity ticket with Ivonne Baki on top or Baki leaves the race.
Tonight former Ferrero-Waldner supporters are considering how to vote. Mexican Dep Secretary for 10 issues called
me. They are wondering whether to support Baki in round 4 now that F-W is out.
I noted that we wanted the strongest of the ladies to stay in (Fyi, they both were on our list of the most qualified
candidates.) Too early a pull out could also affect the race.
The Egyptian candidate could lose because of a consolidation of alternative candidates.
I am sorry to report that the Egyptians have used harsh tactics in the halls of UNESCO. A member of the U.S. delegation
has seen a member of the Egyptian-hired "public relations" group walking around with an envelope of cash. They
pushed to have two Amb recalled. Disgust and resentment is running high.
The Egyptians are pushing delegations very hard. FM Aboul-Gheit has stopped in Paris to deal with the UNESCO race
while en route to NY for UNGA.
A/S Feltman writes that Egyptian Ambassador Shoukry has called him twice today with a "message from the Foreign
Minister." FM Aboul Gheit is angry and reports President Mubarak is angry.
A/S Feltman notes " maybe we've become a convenient excuse." A/S Feltman very helpfully pushed back and helped
defend our ambassador who had been criticized.
Our strategy relies on our Amb being low-key. He is following his instructions. We should be unhappy with the way he is
being attacked personally. Candidates Bukova and Baki are moving ahead on their own lobbying. FYI, Hosni even said
on French TV that the U.S. is neutral reflecting our especially low key approach this past week. Now that Hosni may
lose, the U.S. looks like a convenient one to blame.

Events will continue to develop among the candidates and voting delegations. The Monday 9am Paris time Europeans'
meeting could indicate Bukova's relative support and offer a chance to reveal any Baki-Bukova deal if there is one.
Meanwhile Egyptian pressure is likely to continue at UNESCO on Monday.
Monday's vote is midday EDT.

African support appears to be moving to Bukova. Amb Killion has received a series of calls from African ambassadors as
they want credit.
We are talkng at Unesco in. Paris and with capital delegations arriving in New York. Key votes: Chile, Phillipines,

Helicopter support for Emb Baghdad
• Pat Kennedy noted that Blackwater's contract ends Sept. 4, but problems have arisen with the successor being
ready to assume helo support tasks; they have not secured the necessary helos nor obtained the required
certificates of airworthiness and are in breach of their contract. Rather than shut down Embassy operations
after Sept. 4, it may be necessary to give Blackwater a short (perhaps 2 months) extension until the successor is
ready to perform. M is talking to Chris Hill about our options; he would need to discuss this with the Iraqis if
Blackwater is extended.
Libya
• Rich Verma noted the planned demonstration in Englewood, New Jersey this weekend in opposition to Qaddafi's
desire to stay there during UNGA. There is now a possibility that Qaddafi will stay at a hotel in Manhattan. Bill

Senator Lautenberg.
Hearings
• Rich reported that Chris Hill is scheduled to appear before the SFRC on Sept 9 and the HFAC on Sept 10, perhaps
with Gen. Odierno, although Odierno may not be available those dates. There was discussion of the pros and
cons of appearing with or without Gen. Odierno, given past precedent on Iraq and Afghanistan testimony and
the general rule that ambassadors usually do not testify on the Hill.
• Upcoming confirmation hearings include those for Bob Hormats on Sept 9, perhaps with Jose Fernandez, and a
panel of EUR ambassadorial-nominees on Sept 10. Also, Richard Holbrooke will testify on Sept 15 before the

At 0429 EDT Mr. Kim Davidson, RSO Embassy Riyadh, informed the EAO that there has been a "security incident" in the
city of Yanbu, Saudi Arabia (approx 150 km North of Jeddah). Saudi Arabia security forces have engaged "some type of
bad guys". Post cannot confirm if the bad guys are terrorist or just some criminal element, but notes that the MFA is
saying the incident is purely criminal. Post further notes that there is a desalinization plant and oil refinery located in
Yanbu which have been targets of previous terrorist attacks. Post commented there will be several visiting dignitaries
and heads of state in Saudi Arabia tomorrow for the opening of a major University. A local Human rights group is

PARIS (AP) UNESCO says a career diplomat from Bulgaria has defeated a controversial Egyptian candidate to head the
United Nations agency for culture and education. The chairman of UNESCO's executive board says Bulgaria's
ambassador to France, Irina Bokova, has beaten longtime Egyptian Culture Minister Farouk Hosny in secret
balloting. UNESCO's press office says Bokova won 31 to 27 Tuesday in a suspenseful fifth round. The Egyptian was long
considered a favorite, despite his threat last year to burn Israeli books, and Egypt's contentious record of cultural
censorship under his watch. Hosny apologized for the book-burning comment, but many Jewish activists said he was
unfit to be the U.N.'s guardian of culture.

Subject How Anthony Weiner Helped the Public Option Return From the Brink -- New York
Magazine
The Power Grid
Back From the Death Panel How the public option, helped by a congressman looking for an issue and a shrewdly silent White House,
returned from the brink.
•Published Oct 11, 2009
On the night last week when much of Washington was joyously weeping over the seal of approval bestowed on the Baucus health-care
bill by the Congressional Budget Office, Anthony Weiner was in his quarters in the Rayburn Building, merrily pissing all over the
legislation instead. "It's just too weak," he told me. "It doesn't do enough It doesn't achieve real cost savings. There's no real
competition. It's pretty much a wish list for the insurance companies." And those were merely Weiner's substantive criticisms of the
bill. His political assessment was even harsher: "It's effectively dead," he said. Not a droplet of Weiner's dismissal of the Baucus
plan came as any sort of shock; he's been trashing the Senate Finance Committee's efforts for weeks. What's surprising is that anyone
gives a fig what Weiner has to say about the topic in the first place. Until six months ago, after all, the congressman was known more
for his yearning to acquire the keys to Gracie Mansion than his mastery of the arcana of Medicare reimbursement rates. In fact, as
Weiner would be the first to admit, his interest in, knowledge of, and record on health-care reform were perilously close to
nonexistent. And yet, since May, when he concluded that taking on Mike Bloomberg was a challenge that went beyond the Sisyphean
into the realm of the just plain silly, Weiner has emerged as one of the few real stars in the marathon health-care debate: the clearest
and savviest (and, as always, loudest and noodgiest) voice in favor of the public option. And though it's plain that whatever bill
eventually lands on Barack Obama's desk—and, yes, I think the odds are now close to overwhelming that a big pile of health-care
paper will wind up there—won't be anything close to Weiner's single-payer dream, his role in framing the terms of the discussion has
been more than salutary. In some non-obvious ways, you could argue that it's been essential. I should confess at the outset that I have
a long-standing soft spot for Weiner, whom I first met more than twenty years ago, when he was a budding Chuck Schumer protégé
and we played on the same Capitol Hill softball team. Weiner then was strikingly similar to Weiner now: amped-up, ambitious,
wicked smart, forever gauging all the angles, unafraid of being (actually, proud of being) a royal pain in the tuchis. All the qualities, in
other words, that have served him so well in the wrangle over health care. Weiner describes his efflorescence on the subject as a
matter of opportunism, in the best sense of the word. "This was one of those unusual issues where we really didn't have a mother ship
that was directing the message, and that created an entrepreneurial environment," he says. "You didn't have the president out there
speaking clearly about what he wanted. And among my colleagues, there weren't people that jumped out who either had a comfort
with the material or weren't intimidated by the blowback" Weiner laughs. "Frankly, I like the blowback. After my thirteenth town-
hall meeting, someone on my staff said, 'I can't tell if you're a sadist or a masochist.— Weiner is right about the nature of the vacuum
that he smartly stepped in to fill, but there are at least two other proximate causes for it that should be added to his list: the illness and
death of Ted Kennedy and the migration of Hillary Clinton out of the Senate and into Foggy Bottom, which deprived the debate of
what would have been its two dominant liberal protagonists. For Weiner, Clinton's absence and its implications carry a personal twist;
he is engaged to Huma Abedin, Hillary's longtime personal aide. "It's a weird irony that I'm kind of part of the family now and this
has become my issue," Weiner says. "If Hillary had stayed in the Senate, I would never have had this opening." Weiner allows that
he's discussed the health-care battle with Clinton; what she's told him he will not say. But one imagines she approves of the
cleverness and chutzpa he's displayed—especially in drawing an explicit analogy between the public option and Medicare, an
equation that not only increases support for the proposal among voters but flushes out the phoniness of the Republican howls against a
"government takeover" of health care. And one similarly imagines Madame Secretary's chagrin at watching the Obama White House
pursue a dance-of-the-seven-veils strategy explicitly designed to be the antithesis of the one she employed back in 1993 and
1994. Weiner's view of the administration's approach hasn't exactly been approving—a point he's made abundantly and consistently
clear over the past months. On the eve of Obama's September speech before a joint session of Congress, Weiner cracked that "up to
now, the messaging from the White House has been done by Sybil ... They seem to have a different perspective on this every couple
of hours." And he's apparently had no change of heart. "The president has been a miserable messenger on this by and large," he tells
me.
Such criticisms haven't gone unnoticed at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, in no small part because Weiner—in a testament to his
consistency, lunacy, inability to shut up, or all three—hasn't shied away from making them directly. Indeed, on a recent flight back to
Washington from New York on Air Force One, I'm told by one congressman who witnessed the scene, Weiner got into a testy

exchange with Obama over the former's ideas about how the latter might better prosecute the case for reform. When I ask Weiner
about the incident, he refuses to divulge details, but notes that when it was over, the president said to him drily, "I hope you're
enjoying your last trip on Air Force One." "He was kidding—I think," adds Weiner. In truth, Weiner has been on the receiving end of
zero complaints from the White House for his potshots. "I see Rahm [Emanuel] at the House gym every morning, and he's never
beefed to me about this once," Weiner says. "I think he needs this pressure from the left—it serves them. They needed someone to
generate the heat of their base to give them the space to be the moderate voice. I'm convinced that if it weren't me, they'd have to
create me." Weiner's theory is self-serving, but it makes a kind of sense. Over the summer, Weiner, by threatening to bottle up a vote
on the main House health-care bill in the Energy and Commerce Committee, forced House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to grant him a floor
vote this fall on a single-payer plan. Weiner believes in single-payer as a matter of policy—but he also sees the political advantage of
putting forward a proposal that will at once satisfy certain elements of the base and create the appearance that the public option is
itself a compromise toward the center. And his adamant advocacy of a robust public option itself generates breathing room for the sort
of modified version that might win approval in both the House and Senate. What Weiner has no doubt about now is that the final
legislation will include just such a provision—because without it, there simply aren't the votes in the House to pass a bill. "I think
President Obama will put his finger on the scale at some point," he says. In the end, it's going to be simpler to corral one or two
senators to accept a public option with some modifications than it's going to be to get a hundred House members off their rebellious
screed. From what Weiner can divine from Emanuel and others in the White House, this kind of brass-tacks calculation—not the
policy merits, not even the long-range political ramifications—is all that matters now. Obama's bizarro, out-of-nowhere acquisition of
the Nobel Peace Prize at the end of last week notwithstanding, the president has had a rough few months and badly needs to put a win
on the board. And no one is looking to make that any harder than it's been already. To illustrate why that means the public option
will prevail, Weiner colorfully sketches out his vision of the endgame: "Obama goes to Nancy and says, 'I've decided I'm giving up
the public option.' And she says, 'Well, dude, I can't get this done then.' So then he goes to Harry Reid and says, 'We're going with
the public option. What do we have to do in Nebraska to get Ben Nelson onboard?' That's a much easier conversation." E-mail:

Subject: Egypt delays signing of Palestinian unity pact
By Nidal al-Mughrabi
GAZA, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Egypt has delayed the signing of a deal to heal the rift between President Mahmoud
Abbas' Fatah movement and the rival Palestinian Islamist group Hamas because of "new complications", an
Egyptian official said on Friday.
He cited the growing tension between Fatah and Hamas over the handling by Abbas of a U.N. report criticising
the Israeli military offensive into Gaza in December and January.
Cairo had slated a signing ceremony for October 25. The agreement would resolve nothing immediately but
would outline steps to restore Palestinian unity. Hamas runs the Gaza Strip and Fatah dominates in the Israeli-
occupied West Bank.
The official told Reuters no new date was set for signing.
"Egypt saw it was better to delay until there is a suitable atmosphere," he said.
Abbas admits his government erred in approving a U.N. decision in Geneva two weeks ago to delay action on
the so-called Goldstone report, which is particularly critical of Israel for alleged war crimes during the Gaza
offensive.
He has reversed course and the issue was being reconsidered on Friday at a special session of the U.N. Human
Rights Council in Geneva, which Abbas requested.
"We are not going to let things collapse," said another Egyptian official of his country's lengthy mediation
between the Palestinian factions which began over a year ago.
"We will wait until the dust settles and activate efforts again and I hope that will be very soon."
The deal would postpone Palestinian presidential and parliamentarian elections until June 28, 2010.
Fatah has signed it and this week Abbas announced that if Hamas did not sign he would go ahead with elections
in January as called for by the constitution.
It is unclear how Fatah would be able to hold a full election since Hamas has vowed to block voting in Gaza if
the ballot was scheduled without its agreement.

Senior Fatah leader Azzam Al-Ahmed, who carried the signed document to Cairo, said the group would not
seek to hold elections in the West Bank alone.
He said failure to reach an agreement could delay the vote "indefinitely", which would prolong the divisions
and weaken Abbas's peace approach.
Hamas officials said they had asked Cairo for another three days to give a final response.

BAGHDAD (AP) At least 16 people have been killed as two truck bombs struck separate communities north of Iraq's
capital. One bombing killed at least a dozen people in a primarily Sunni village north of Baghdad. Officials say police
opened fire in an attempt to stop the truck, forcing it to change direction and slam into a concrete barrier near a market.
The blast damaged the police station and a number of nearby homes and shops. The attack comes three days after Iraqi
police defused a car bomb in the same area, and the police chief says it may be retaliation. The second attack occurred
near Mosul, where a parked truck bomb exploded and killed at least four people.

<http://www.clintonglobalinitiative.orgiournneetings/meeting_annual.asp?Section=OurMeetings&PageTitle=CGI%20An

Obama administration actually thought about having it shut down as a price of Mrs. Clinton becoming Secretary of State
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dynkontent/article/2008/11/16/AR2008111602039.html> , fearful that Bill's
schmoozing of wealthy philanthropists could compromise his wife's role as America's top diplomat. Now, Obama is going

annual "Philanthropy Oscars."

Yet the most important speech at the event may not be delivered by either the current or the former president but by
Mrs. Clinton herself. She has said the State Department is going to forge new partnerships with philanthropists to
achieve America's foreign policy goals (and has already started work on a new initiative around the Middle East peace
process). Her speech is an opportunity to announce a radical new departure in the way America gives aid.
The aid business in crisis. The past year may have been tough for the world's richest countries, but it has been far harder
for the poorest. Markets for exports have slumped as rich consumers have reined in their spending. Government
budgets are creaking under the strain of the global recession and foreign aid is threatening to dry up. At the same time,
the intellectual attack on aid has escalated, led by the author of "Dead Aid" <http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-
dyn/content/article/2009/04/02/AR2009040203285.html> , the African economist, Dambisa Moyo.
The CGI has become the showcase for those who believe Moyo is wrong and that aid can be effective. The CGI is not
about the old government-to-government aid model. Its members aim to deliver smart aid, based on partnerships
between business, philanthropists, and social entrepreneurs. Mrs. Clinton's speech is the perfect opportunity to show
that government is ready to work with the CGI crowd to rethink how it does aid.
One promising, for-profit solution to poverty is to take the model of microfinance -- one of the more resilient corners of
banking during the financial crisis -- and extend it to improve education, health care, clean water and sanitation. Loan-
based investments can be more sustainable than traditional aid or charity, because they tap the far larger sums available
in the capital markets and are not dependent on the whims of political leaders or budgetary wrangling. Some in
government may be reluctant to give up their near monopoly on aid but it is long overdue.
A second opportunity is to get the public more involved in the aid business. New giving organizations such as Kiva
<http://www.kiva.org/about/how> have demonstrated how the public can play an effective role in allocating money to
needy people <http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/06/AR2009070603594.html> .
Government should be doing all it can to encourage his type of mass philanthrocapitalism that levers the generosity of
the American people and taps into the wisdom of crowds. It is time for government aid to be made more democratic by
letting Kiva and others like it distribute some of the tax dollars.
Finally, Mrs. Clinton should seize the opportunity to turn the aid business on its head and pass control from the
bureaucrats to the poor people themselves. Technology such as the internet and the mobile phone are now widespread
in the developing world, so why not use these tools to give a greater voice in aid spending to the people the money is
intended to help? Much aid has gone to waste because of a lack of feedback from the intended beneficiaries. Imagine
how the best technology entrepreneurs could transform the aid business, in the same way that they have changed the
media, by giving the poor a say in how the aid billions are spent.
The Obama Administration has made all the right noises about making government smarter by working more with the
philanthrocapitalists. At home, the creation of a White House Office of Social Innovation
<http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Obama-to-Request-50-Million-to-Identify-and-Expand-
Effective-Innovative-Non-Profits/> was a welcome first move, yet it is still to be seen whether this will amount to much
more than a new source of grant funding for the nonprofit sector. The big win is in remaking government through
innovative partnerships with the private sector. Mrs Clinton has been mulling over what to do with USAID for nearly a
year. What better opportunity than the CGI to announce a bold new strategy for smart aid?

Subject: (Nytimes) U.S. Accuses Pakistan of Altering Missiles
WASHINGTON — The United States has accused Pakistan of illegally modifying
American-made missiles to expand its capability to strike land targets, a potential
threat to India, according to senior administration and Congressional officials.
The charge, which set off a new outbreak of tensions between the United States and
Pakistan, was made in an unpublicized diplomatic protest in late June to Prime
Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani and other top Pakistani officials.
The accusation comes at a particularly delicate time, when the administration is asking
Congress to approve $7.5 billion in aid to Pakistan over the next five years, and when
Washington is pressing a reluctant Pakistani military to focus its attentions on fighting
the Taliban, rather than expanding its nuclear and conventional forces aimed at India.
While American officials say that the weapon in the latest dispute is a conventional one
— based on the Harpoon antiship missiles that were sold to Pakistan by the Reagan
administration as a defensive weapon in the cold war — the subtext of the argument is
growing concern about the speed with which Pakistan is developing new generations of
both conventional and nuclear weapons.
"There's a concerted effort to get these guys to slow down," one senior administration
official said. "Their energies are misdirected."
At issue is the detection by American intelligence agencies of a suspicious missile test
on April 23 — a test never announced by the Pakistanis — that appeared to give the
country a new offensive weapon.

American military and intelligence officials say they suspect that Pakistan has modified
the Harpoon antiship missiles that the United States sold the country in the 198os, a
move that would be a violation of the Arms Control Export Act. Pakistan has denied the
charge, saying it developed the missile itself. The United States has also accused
Pakistan of modifying American-made P-3C aircraft for land-attack missions, another
violation of United States law that the Obama administration has protested.
Whatever their origin, the missiles would be a significant new entry into Pakistan's
arsenal against India. They would enable Pakistan's small navy to strike targets on
land, complementing the sizable land-based missile arsenal that Pakistan has
developed. That, in turn, would be likely to spur another round of an arms race with
India that the United States has been trying, unsuccessfully, to halt. "The focus of our
concern is that this is a potential unauthorized modification of a maritime antiship
defensive capability to an offensive land-attack missile," said another senior
administration official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity because the
matter involves classified information.
"The potential for proliferation and end-use violations are things we watch very
closely," the official added. "When we have concerns, we act aggressively."
A senior Pakistani official, also speaking on the condition of anonymity because the
interchanges with Washington have been both delicate and highly classified, said the
American accusation was "incorrect." The official said that the missile tested was
developed by Pakistan, just as it had modified North Korean designs to build a range of
land-based missiles that could strike India. He said that Pakistan had taken the
unusual step of agreeing to allow American officials to inspect the country's Harpoon
inventory to prove that it had not violated the law, a step that administration officials
praised.
Some experts are also skeptical of the American claims. Robert Hewson, editor of
Jane's Air Launched Weapons, a yearbook and Web-based data service, said the
Harpoon missile did not have the necessary range for a land-attack missile, which
would lend credibility to Pakistani claims that they are developing their own new
missile. Moreover, he said, Pakistan already has more modern land-attack missiles that
it developed itself or acquired from China.
"They're beyond the need to reverse-engineer old U.S. kit," Mr. Hewson said in a
telephone interview. "They're more sophisticated than that." Mr. Hewson said the ship-
to-shore missile that Pakistan was testing was part of a concerted effort to develop an

array of conventional missiles that could be fired from the air, land or sea to address
India's much more formidable conventional missile arsenal.
The dispute highlights the level of mistrust that remains between the United States and
a Pakistani military that American officials like to portray as an increasingly reliable
partner in the effort to root out the forces of the Taliban and Al Qaeda on Pakistani
territory. A central element of the American effort has been to get the military
refocused on the internal threat facing the country, rather than on threat the country
believes it still faces from India.
Pakistani officials have insisted that they are making that shift. But the evidence
continues to point to heavy investments in both nuclear and conventional weapons that
experts say have no utility in the battle against insurgents.
Over the years, the United States has provided a total of 165 Harpoon missiles to
Pakistan, including 37 of the older-model weapons that were delivered from 1985 to
1988, said Charles Taylor, a spokesman for the Defense Security Cooperation Agency.
The country's nuclear arsenal is expanding faster than any other nation's. In May,
Pakistan conducted a test firing of its Babur medium-range cruise missile, a weapon
that military experts say could potentially be tipped with a nuclear warhead. The test
was conducted on May 6, during a visit to Washington by President Asif Ali Zardari,
but was not made public by Pakistani officials until three days after the meetings had
ended to avoid upsetting the talks. While it may be technically possible to arm the
Harpoons with small nuclear weapons, outside experts say it would probably not be
necessary.
Before Congress departed for its summer recess, administration officials briefed crucial
legislators on the protest to Pakistan. The dispute has the potential to delay or possibly
even derail the legislation to provide Pakistan with $7.5 billion in civilian aid over five
years; lawmakers are scheduled to vote on the aid package when they return from their
recess next month.
The legislation is sponsored by Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts and Richard G.
Lugar of Indiana, the top Democrat and Republican on the Foreign Relations
Committee, as well as Representative Howard L. Berman, a California Democrat who
leads the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Congressional aides are now reconciling
House and Senate versions of the legislation.

Frederick Jones, a spokesman for Mr. Kerry, declined to comment on the details of the
dispute citing its classified nature but suggested that the pending multifaceted aid bill
would clear Congress "in a few weeks" and would help cooperation between the two
countries.
"There have been irritants in the U.S.-Pakistan relationship in the past and there will
be in the future," Mr. Jones said in a statement, noting that the pending legislation
would provide President Obama "with new tools to address troubling behavior."

Problem is, we need to get the statement out tomorrow (Aug 31), so that "six weeks" falls on Oct 12 — before
the soccer match. Even in best of worlds this will require further haggling with other side over next 24 hours,
so I fear if she doesn't call til afternoon on 31st (Turkey/Armenia time) we won't get it done.
If she really can't do it today would suggest Jim do so (could blame Kennedy funeral) because we need to try
this today.

We've sent word that she's going to call (I think Davu is in Slovenia but should be available). I think we've got
agreement on the text after another word change or two, and Davu will know that the key issue is agreeing on a
date for a signing and submission to parliaments. We've told the Turks that it "should be" in early
October. They will push back, and if they agree to a date at all it will probably be Oct 12. That will be much
harder to sell to other side, but our minimum need is a date at least by then. Thanks.

We've sent word that she's going to call (I think Davu is in Slovenia but should be available). I think we've got
agreement on the text after another word change or two, and Davu will know that the key issue is agreeing on a date for
a signing and submission to parliaments. We've told the Turks that it "should be" in early October. They will push back,
and if they agree to a date at all it will probably be Oct 12. That will be much harder to sell to other side, but our
minimum need is a date at least by then. Thanks.

We've sent word that she's going to call (I think Davu is in Slovenia but should be available). I think we've got
agreement on the text after another word change or two, and Davu will know that the key issue is agreeing on a date for
a signing and submission to parliaments. We've told the Turks that it "should be" in early October. They will push back,
and if they agree to a date at all it will probably be Oct 12. That will be much harder to sell to other side, but our
minimum need is a date at least by then. Thanks.

Thank you for reaching out to Secretary Solis and convincing her to join the Verification Commission. She and Ricardo
Lagos will make for a very high profile and effective international component of the Commission.
We will meet with her this morning at 10 am to brief her for Tuesday's journey to Honduras. At this point, it appears we
have a military aircraft available. The plan is for the U.S. Delegation to depart D.C., stop in Miami to pick up Ricardo
Lagos, and arrive in Tegucigalpa together. We think this will send a powerful message to Hondurans and leave no doubt
about our commitment to seeing this process through to a successful conclusion.
You should be aware that Ambassador Hugo Llorens is under public assault. The Wall Street Journal dedicates its
America's column this morning to attacking him and calling for his removal. Last Friday, Representative Connie Mack did

the same. This chorus will grow as the extent of our accomplishment is understood. Llorens is a tough, stalwart guy. He
and his Mission have held firm during this crisis. A call from you would be a big boost.
Finally, we will hold an IPC today to identify further steps. We will keep you up to date on these steps and identify
further opportunities for your engagement.
I want to thank you for your leadership and support during this long crisis. Your willingness to engage at key moments
and take risks at the right time have propelled us much further than anyone expected. Your diplomacy prevented a
debilitating civil conflict in Honduras that would have destabilized Central America and undermined two decades of our
efforts. We now have a big opportunity in front of us, and for that we are grateful to you.

Oscar Arias told me he is very worried about whether the agreement will be implemented and is meeting w the
leading Presidential candidate this week to urge that he produce his party's 55 votes for restitution.
I also spoke w Insulza who is focussed on the elections which I told him we would fully support. Is there more we
should be doing?
Again, thanks for all your great work and good luck in the effort to get this across the finish line. Best, HRC

Asif Akhtar, Lahore: Urdu news channel anchors ... succeed in prompting Clinton to declare that far
from being dispatched, the money had only been set aside, and if the Pakistani people didn't want the
money they didn't have to take it. The open-ended question reduced a cackling room to pin-drop
silence, almost embarrassing the anchors for pursuing that line of questioning in the first place. It
seems none of the haughty anchors were ready to make the billion-dollar blunder by ticking off the
Secretary of State and losing all that aid money.
Clinton handled most of the questions and concerns with a calm and a poise people would have
never expected from her predecessor Condaleeza Rice, who would have been more comfortable
carrying out the offensive without the charm.
Given the circumstances, this attempt by a US official at bridging the gap between Pakistani
opinions and US policy is commendable.
Maryam, Lahore: We need to use our heads rather than our emotions all the time. its time to reflect
where we went wrong as a nation too.'
Ibrahim, Lahore: it was really funny to see Mrs. Clinton handling the whole bunch of media and spin
them around her little finger. Mrs. Clinton on the other hand carried herself like a true diplomat and a
leader!

Ideologues hijack a compromise
By Edward Schumacher-Matos
Friday, November 6, 2009
Adults learn that human conflicts are seldom black and white. So the way the international community jumped
to punish tiny Honduras for the ouster of its president, without knowing the facts, was foolish.
That some Senate Republicans have been extremist in the other direction borders on galling. Opposing a U.S.-
brokered agreement reached a week ago by Hondurans to defuse the crisis, the senators, led by South Carolina's
Jim DeMint, have been grandstanding on principles that have little to do with reality, contributing to looming
chaos in that Central American country and undermining U.S. policy in the region.
In this, the age of fundamentalist ayatollahs, the knee-jerk cold warriors among the Senate Republicans are no
better than the knee-jerk anti-military officials in the Organization of American States.
The compromise leaves egg on the face of the OAS and an intelligentsia that refused to see Honduras as more
than a banana republic that somehow could infect the region, only to be confronted by a Senate cabal that treats
Honduras as . . . a banana republic that somehow could infect the rest of the region.
The former see this impoverished backwater of 8 million people setting off a chain of military coups, while the
latter see it setting off a chain of leftist dictatorships. The two share an equally misguided domino theory.
Poor Honduras, in the meantime.
The compromise, put together by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and -- yes -- sensible State Department
diplomats, creatively settled on a process instead of an end. Ousted President Manuel Zelaya and de facto
President Roberto Micheletti agreed to allow the Honduran Congress, with the advice of that country's Supreme
Court, to resolve the question of whether Zelaya should return to office for the last 2 1/2 months of his term.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765224 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765224 Date: 07/31/2015
Zelaya created the crisis by instigating mob rule in June to try to carry out an unconstitutional referendum
designed to lift a limit on a president's time in office. The Supreme Court ordered the military to arrest him, but
the generals, fearful of riots, went one step further and illegally exiled him. Congress, not the military, then took
political control. Zelaya later snuck back into Honduras, however, and is now holed up in the Brazilian
Embassy.
The Honduran Congress is likely to allow Zelaya's reinstatement, with limited powers, as a way to gain
legitimacy for long-scheduled presidential elections later this month. That is what it should do, but Zelaya has
postponed discussing the makeup of the cabinet, and Congress could shut him out. Public tension is high, but
DeMint and other Republicans, instead of counseling caution, opposed even the compromise agreement and are
demanding that Zelaya be rejected, setting up the country for revolution.
They have been doing reckless damage in Washington as well. Since the spring, they have held up the
appointments of the administration's Latin America policy team. DeMint lifted the hold only late Thursday,
after Clinton promised him that the United States would recognize the Honduran elections even if Zelaya is not
reinstated, an end the Republicans are unwisely pushing.
The intellectual force behind the Republican obstruction is the Wall Street Journal's influential Americas
columnist, Mary O'Grady. Beating the Honduran drum for months, O'Grady maintains that Zelaya's return
would be a victory for Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's leftist president. She further accuses President Obama of
being Chavez's virtual ally. As she wrote this week: "Mr. Chavez and Fidel Castro were supporting Mr. Zelaya,
and Mr. Obama apparently wanted to be part of the gang."
O'Grady is a friend and former colleague of mine, so I know that she is concerned for Latin America's welfare.
But her scorched-earth accusations against Obama and Clinton are wrong. An obsession with Chavez and
Castro also builds both up when their influence is waning in the region. Being ideologically black or white may
feel good, but it isn't helpful in resolving gray constitutional -- or human -- affairs.
Anyway, it's the grays that make life interesting.
The administration was right to calibrate its response, working with the de facto government while slowly
increasing the pressure for Zelaya's return by cutting aid to Honduras. The policy recognized that both sides
have valid arguments. It also deftly sidelined Chavez, making him irrelevant. A deal was possible only as the
election approached and both sides became ready to compromise. What the deal needs now is support, not
obstruction, from the U.S. Senate.

Subject: Honduran Congress will rule on Zelaya after vote
TEGUCIGALPA (AP) -The leader of the Honduran Congress said lawmakers would not decide whether to restore ousted
President Manuel Zelaya until after the November 29 presidential elections. Congressional president Jose Alfredo
Saavedra said lawmakers would vote December 2 on whether Zelaya should return to the presidency. The decision
raises questions about whether the international community would recognize the outcome of the elections. Several
countries have warned they would not recognize the vote unless Zelaya is restored beforehand. The United States has

To All:
Yesterday, when I left Tegucigalpa, we used the departure to put more pressure on M. I called a top M aide and said I
was leaving, and that if my message in Washington was that M refused to help us help him, we would have to take our
own steps to make clear our position on Honduras. (They assume that means visas stay revoked and more could be
pulled.) We preferred to achieve our objectives through a patriotic gesture on M's part (a step-aside) but we have to
protect our principles and our interests in the region. Washington would be very disappointed that M refused to
cooperate with the country that has done the most to promote support for the October 30 Accord and promote support
for elections in his country. Moreover, M would be passing up a chance to go down in history as a statesman as
opposed the man who launched a coup.
Last night the aide called Hugo to say that M had considered this again and was sensitive to our arguments. He had
decided to make a speech today (November 19) to announce that he as "absenting himself" for the days preceding the
election through December 2 —the date of the vote on Z's restitution in the Congress. The latter is a significant date,
because if Z wins the vote, M is gone, and if Z loses the vote, M has no reason to stay to keep Z out. M will leave the
country in the control of a sort of executive council.
This afternoon M's staff shared with us the draft of a speech that M plans to make tonight at 7:00 pm EST (6:00 pm in
Honduras). We have been suggesting edits to the text, which M has accepted.
This is Honduras, so we will wait to see what happens at 7:00 pm. If M goes through with it, we will launch calls to key
countries to urged them to recognize that the situation on the ground has changed enough to allow more vigorous
support for elections. Zelaya and ALBA will say this is not enough, but we will work on countries that matter.
Best,

It's been 89 days since Manuel Zelaya was booted from power. He's sleeping on chairs, and he claims his
throat is sore from toxic gases and "Israeli mercenaries" are torturing him with high-frequency radiation.
"We are being threatened with death," he said in an interview with The Miami Herald, adding that
mercenaries were likely to storm the embassy where he has been holed up since Monday and
assassinate him.
"I prefer to march on my feet than to live on my knees before a military dictatorship," Zelaya said in a
series of back-to-back interviews.
Zelaya was deposed at gunpoint on June 28 and slipped back into his country on Monday, just two
days before he was scheduled to speak before the United Nations. He sought refuge at the Brazilian
Embassy, where Zelaya said he is being subjected to toxic gases and radiation that alter his physical
and mental state.
Witnesses said that for a short time Tuesday morning, soldiers used a device that looked like a large
satellite dish to emit a loud shrill noise.
Honduran police spokesman Orlin Cerrato said he knew nothing of any radiation devices being used
against the former president.
"He says there are mercenaries against him? Using some kind of apparatus?" Cerrato said. "No, no,
no, no. Sincerely: no. The only elements surrounding that embassy are police and military, and they
have no such apparatus."

Police responded to reports of looting throughout the city Tuesday night. Civil disturbances subsided
Wednesday afternoon, when a crush of people rushed grocery stores and gas stations in the capital.
Israeli government sources in Miami said they could not confirm the presence of any "Israelis
mercenaries" in Honduras.
Zelaya, 56, is at the embassy with his family and other supporters, without a change of clothes or
toothpaste. The power and water were turned back on, and the U.N. brought in some food. Photos
showed Zelaya, his trademark cowboy hat across his face, napping on a few chairs he had pushed
together.
"Look at the shape he's in — sleeping on chairs," de facto President Roberto Micheletti told a local TV
news station.
Micheletti took Zelaya's place after the military, executing a Supreme Court arrest warrant, burst into
Zelaya's house and forced him into exile. The country's military, congress, Supreme Court and
economic leaders have backed the ouster, arguing that Zelaya was bent on conducting an illegal
plebiscite that they feared would ultimately lead to his reelection.
Micheletti said he was prepared to meet with Zelaya and a delegation from the Organization of
American States, but only to discuss one topic: November elections.
On Wednesday, the U.N. cut off all technical aid that would have supported and given credibility to
that presidential race. Conditions do not exist for credible elections, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-
moon said.
"I proposed dialogue, and they answered with bullets, bombs, a state of siege and by closing the
airport," Zelaya said.
Zelaya told The Herald that Washington should be taking a stronger stance against the elite
economic interests that "financed and benefited" from the coup that ousted him three months ago.
If President Barack Obama hit Honduras with commercial sanctions or suspended free-trade
agreements, the coup "would last just five minutes."
The Obama administration suspended economic aid to Honduras and withdrew the visas of members
of the current administration.
About 75 percent of Honduras' commerce depends on the United States, Zelaya said. And because
powerful economic forces were behind Zelaya's ouster, Obama should hit those forces where it hurts
most, Zelaya said.
"I have told this to Obama, to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, to the U.S. Embassy here and
anyone else who will listen," Zelaya said. "They know how to act. Until now, they have been very
prudent."
With Micheletti showing a new willingness to talk with the OAS, and the U.N. Security Council set to
meet to discuss the embassy situation soon, it isn't the moment for more penalties, the U.S. State
Department said.

"Right now, when there are openings for dialogue, is not the time to announce new sanctions," a
State Department official said.
Dates for the OAS visit, which could include emissaries from 10 countries, are being worked out, the
official said.
Spokesman Ian Kelly said the U.N. Security Council meeting came at the request of the Brazilian
government. No date has been set for the meeting.
"In general, we continue to work with our partners in the U.N. and the OAS to come up with means to
promote a dialogue and defuse the tensions, of course with the ultimate goal of resolving the crisis,"
State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said at a media briefing in Washington. "And we're
continuing our consultations with our partners in the region, and enlisting wherever we can their
assistance in this process."
The U.S. Embassy here spent the day denying rumors that Zelaya planned to move to American
grounds. The rumor may have started because U.S. Embassy vehicles were used to evacuate Zelaya
supporters who left the Brazilian Embassy willingly Tuesday.
"The embassy has been turned into a bunker for Zelaya," Assistant Foreign Minister Martha Lorena
Alvarado de Casco told The Herald. "He's turned it into his headquarters, and he is using it to call for
insurrection."
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim told CNN en Espanol that his government asked Zelaya to
tone down his rhetoric while he remains an embassy guest.
"The word 'death' should not even be mentioned," he said.
Rioting broke out in various parts of the capital Tuesday night, and lines hundreds deep formed at
supermarkets when desperate shoppers scrambled to buy food after a round-the-clock curfew was
briefly lifted.
"I have no food in my house," said Patti Vasquez, a housewife who, after two hours, still had not
reached the front doors of a supermarket in an upscale shopping mall. "I need to get milk and juice
and eggs."
Zelaya says he has no plans to leave the embassy anytime soon.
. "I am the president the people of Honduras chose," Zelaya said. "A country can't have two
presidents --just one."
Miami Herald staff writer Jim Wyss and special correspondent Stewart Stogel contributed to this
report.

Iran charges three detained Americans with espionage
(Adds background)
TEHRAN, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Iran has charged three detained U.S. citizens with espionage, the official IRNA news agency
quoted a judiciary official as saying on Monday. "The three are charged with espionage. Investigations continue into the
three detained Americans in Iran," Tehran general prosecutor Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi said. The three were held after
they strayed into Iran from northern Iraq at the end of July. The three, Shane Bauer, 27, Sarah Shourd, 31, and Josh
Fattal, 27, crossed into Iranian territory nearly two months ago. Their families say they strayed across the border
accidentally. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad suggested in an interview with the American television network
NBC in September that the Americans' release might be linked to the release of Iranian diplomats he said were being
held by U.S. troops in Iraq. Under Iran's Islamic sharia law, espionage is punishable by death.

ministers with March 8, 5 ministers with President Sleiman). The ones of most concern to us -- Defense (our
help to LAF), Interior (help to police plus municipal elections), Justice (Hariri Tribunal), Finance (can veto
anything because of financial implications) are all either with March 14 or Presidency. That's good. Foreign .
Affairs is with a new guy from Nabih Berri's bloc. with Lebanon rotating onto the Security Council. 1.4(D)

Next step: Hariri and his cabinet have 30 days to come up with the ministerial declaration, basically a
platform, that must be presented to the Parliament along with the cabinet slate for a vote of confidence. This,
too, may be painful, as they debate how to describe "the resistance" in ways that don't cross either U.S. or

Subject: Samual heyman
November 09, 2009
Samuel J. Heyman, who stood out as a corporate raider who preferred to hold on to companies he bought and run them
rather that sell them for a quick profit, died Sunday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 70.
Mr. Heyman's death was confirmed by his wife, Ronnie, who said he had died after complications from open heart
surgery.
Mr. Heyman was most recently chairman of the GAF Corporation, a manufacturer of roofing materials, and a chemical
company that was spun off from GAF, called International Specialty Products. Both companies are based in Wayne, N.J.
A group led by Mr. Heyman bought GAF in 1983 and took it private in 1987 after the stock market crashed. He later spun
off GAF's chemical business into a separate company, I.S.P.
During that period, corporate raiders tended to buy companies, cut operational costs and then sell them at a profit. But
after Mr. Heyman won a battle with GAF's management for control of the company, he told The New York Times: "There
is a very strong potential in chemicals, and we plan to make them grow."
Mr. Heyman, who was also a lawyer, had diverse business holdings, including Heyman Properties, which owns shopping
malls in the Northeast and which grew out of a business he had inherited from his father.
"He was extremely methodical. There was a rhyme and reason to everything he did," said Leon Black, the chairman of
Apollo Management, a private equity firm, and a longtime friend who was once Mr. Heyman's investment banker.
Mr. Black added: "He combined a strong legal background with a strong analytical business strength, and he was a fierce
negotiator. But what really made Sam kick was that he was a builder. It was all about building, whether it was his
companies, his real estate, his art collection or his family."
Mr. Heyman was born March 1, 1939, in Danbury, Conn., to Annette and Lazarus Heyman. His father was a real estate
developer. After graduating from Yale in 1960 and Harvard Law School in 1964, Mr. Heyman went to work in the Justice
Department under Robert F. Kennedy and served as chief assistant United States attorney for Connecticut. He had to cut
that career short when his father needed him to take over the real estate development business.
Mr. Heyman made his biggest mark in the 1983 battle for GAF. A group of shareholders led by Mr. Heyman became
frustrated by management's resistance to selling some of its biggest assets, including the chemicals business.
Mr. Heyman waged an aggressive campaign against the company's chairman and ultimately forced his removal through
a shareholder vote - a rare victory for shareholders during a time when executives of public companies were considered
virtually untouchable.
Once Mr. Heyman took control of GAF, he reversed course and held on to the chemicals business, ultimately making it a
big contributor to the company's profit.

He also moved quickly to cut costs and revamp the business, saying at the time that he was an "impatient man. When I
see a place where money can be saved, I don't waste time."
Mr. Heyman also gave away money. In 1999, he founded the Partnership for Public Service, which provides fellowships
to encourage students to pursue careers in public service. For his charity work, Mr. Heyman won the President's Citizens
Award in 2008.
His other philanthropic interests included the establishment of the Samuel and Ronnie Heyman Center on Corporate
Governance at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law.
He and his wife also collected art. Among their holdings are works by Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock.
In addition to his wife, the former Ronnie Feuerstein, Mr. Heyman is survived by his mother, Annette Heyman of Palm
Beach, Fla.; four children, Lazarus Heyman, Eleanor Propp, Jennifer Millstone and Elizabeth Winter; and nine
grandchildren.

A South Korean warship shot at a North Korean navy ship that crossed the disputed western sea border on the
morning of November 10 and the North's ship shot back, said an officer at the Seoul's Joint Chiefs of
Staff. Another officer said there were no South Korean casualties, though it was unclear whether there were
any on the North Korean side. He said that the North Korean ship was seriously damaged and that it turned
back toward northern waters after the brief skirmish. Both officers spoke on condition of anonymity, citing
department policy.

November 09, 2009
Samuel J. Heyman, who stood out as a corporate raider who preferred to hold on to companies he bought and run them
rather that sell them for a quick profit, died Sunday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 70.
Mr. Heyman's death was confirmed by his wife, Ronnie, who said he had died after complications from open heart
surgery.
Mr. Heyman was most recently chairman of the GAF Corporation, a manufacturer of roofing materials, and a chemical
company that was spun off from GAF, called International Specialty Products. Both companies are based in Wayne, N.J.
A group led by Mr. Heyman bought GAF in 1983 and took it private in 1987 after the stock market crashed. He later spun
off GAF's chemical business into a separate company, I.S.P.
During that period, corporate raiders tended to buy companies, cut operational costs and then sell them at a profit. But
after Mr. Heyman won a battle with GAF's management for control of the company, he told The New York Times: "There
is a very strong potential in chemicals, and we plan to make them grow."
Mr. Heyman, who was also a lawyer, had diverse business holdings, including Heyman Properties, which owns shopping
malls in the Northeast and which grew out of a business he had inherited from his father.
"He was extremely methodical. There was a rhyme and reason to everything he did," said Leon Black, the chairman of
Apollo Management, a private equity firm, and a longtime friend who was once Mr. Heyman's investment banker.

Mr. Black added: "He combined a strong legal background with a strong analytical business strength, and he was a fierce
negotiator. But what really made Sam kick was that he was a builder. It was all about building, whether it was his
companies, his real estate, his art collection or his family."
Mr. Heyman was born March 1, 1939, in Danbury, Conn., to Annette and Lazarus Heyman. His father was a real estate
developer. After graduating from Yale in 1960 and Harvard Law School in 1964, Mr. Heyman went to work in the Justice
Department under Robert F. Kennedy and served as chief assistant United States attorney for Connecticut. He had to cut
that career short when his father needed him to take over the real estate development business.
Mr. Heyman made his biggest mark in the 1983 battle for GAF. A group of shareholders led by Mr. Heyman became
frustrated by management's resistance to selling some of its biggest assets, including the chemicals business.
Mr. Heyman waged an aggressive campaign against the company's chairman and ultimately forced his removal through
a shareholder vote - a rare victory for shareholders during a time when executives of public companies were considered
virtually untouchable.
Once Mr. Heyman took control of GAF, he reversed course and held on to the chemicals business, ultimately making it a
big contributor to the company's profit.
He also moved quickly to cut costs and revamp the business, saying at the time that he was an "impatient man. When I
see a place where money can be saved, I don't waste time."
Mr. Heyman also gave away money. In 1999, he founded the Partnership for Public Service, which provides fellowships
to encourage students to pursue careers in public service. For his charity work, Mr. Heyman won the President's Citizens
Award in 2008.
His other philanthropic interests included the establishment of the Samuel and Ronnie Heyman Center on Corporate
Governance at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law.
He and his wife also collected art. Among their holdings are works by Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock.
In addition to his wife, the former Ronnie Feuerstein, Mr. Heyman is survived by his mother, Annette Heyman of Palm
Beach, Fla.; four children, Lazarus Heyman, Eleanor Propp, Jennifer Millstone and Elizabeth Winter; and nine
grandchildren.

To All:
Friday evening Hugo and I began picking up from de facto sources that M was about to enter a meeting with supporters
and that some of the hardliners were making yet another attempt to dissuade M from taking a leave of absence. We
immediately phoned contacts close to M and warned that if M reneged, we would launch a massive round of visa
revocations, to include families. A couple hours later, sources began to report that M had decided definitively to step
aside as announced. Former President Maduro played a key role in persuading M to keep his promise.
Later, Panamanian VP/FM Varela called me to say he had heard from his private sector contacts in Honduras that M had
"ratified" the decision to take a leave of absence.
We will stay on top of this until M actually leaves.

Colleagues:

Greg Macris, Senior Watch Officer
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip - (AP) Palestinian militants in Gaza have agreed to stop firing rockets into southern Israel. Hamas
announced the agreement this evening, saying it's intended to prevent Israeli retaliation and give Gaza residents more
stability. Hamas' interior minister says it should make it easier for residents to rebuild the infrastructure that was
destroyed in last winter's war with Israel. Hamas has mostly refrained from firing rockets since Israel's three-week
offensive ended in January. Some Gaza militant groups have continued with rocket attacks since the end of the war, but
they've been far less frequent. The latest came this morning, but it caused no injuries. A small faction affiliated with al-
Qaida claimed responsibility.

today, mounted a counterattack, urging M not to leave. We are pushing back as we speak, and our de facto sources
who support the deal are working to nail it down.
We are making the point that M's agreement to us to step aside fueled our successful efforts over last couple days to
keep Euros and many Latins in the game but they need a change on the ground to support elections. M cannot pull
rug out now. Moreover, we said since the de factos claim moral authority (over Zelaya) for carrying out the Oct 30
Accord, they cannot go back on this deal with us.
Will give you updates. I have an open ticket to go back down at any moment if necessary. Will let you know if an S call
would help.

To All:
The de facto authorities' consultations continued today -- with government agencies, Congress and judicial branch. The
meetings just wrapped up. Our sources tell us the process is moving forward and will result in a series of measures
Mon-Wed: some govt resignations and replacements; possible announcement of Dec 2 or 3 for Congressional action on
Z issue; M "step aside." We have reiterated that latter is crucial for our diplomacy to boost election support.
The de factos say the M speech announcing that is being drafted.
De facto negotiators say the military played a useful role today in pushing the process forward.
Amb Llorens notes that while the de facto consultations may look like a stall, the tendency to seek this sort of buy-in is
one reason Honduras historically has been more peaceful than its neighors.
While our role on the most sensitive issue is not known outside of very few people, the impression is growing in the
country and among careful observers in region that something is happening. Insulza told Arturo today that he wants to
find a pragmatic way forward and could use a fig leaf. We hope to produce something more than that. Z's negotiators
are aware something is moving and appear keen to get back in the game, but Z has them on a tight leash and refuses to
play. If things go well in next few days, we will ask S should call Z to encourage him back to the table.
We are in constant touch with the de factos to help keep this on track. While most Hondurans want to move on, there is
still a great deal of polarization that makes progress complicated.
Best,
ck

The hardliners in the regime fought a largely successful counterattack against the deal today, and M appears to be
leaning toward their view that if he steps aside he will endanger the elections.
It goes beyond that. For the hardliners this is almost a religious struggle against a Zelaya they view as dangerous,
duplicitous and vengeful. As one of the hardliners told me two weeks ago: "We are prepared to die for this."
The modest silver lining is that the military has weighed in on the side of the moderates -- the latter include all three of
the de facto negotiators who reached the October 30 Accord.
Hugo believes strongly that Ishould fly down Tuesday morning for one last, blunt effort. Arturo, Dan Restrepo and I
agree. Last time my message, while firm, appealed to M's better angels -- the chance to leave office as a statesman and
deal a strategic defeat to Chavez. I will sharpen it tomorrow. The hardliners fail to see how they are playing into the
hands of the worst actors in the hemisphere -- ALBA crowing will be part of the de facto legacy. I will also make clear
that if the de factos continue down this path we will be forced to underscore our position on the coup in concrete ways
I will make clear that they are undermining any chance we have to increase
international support for the elections. As for our stance on elections, Arturo and Hugo will present options to S in
coming days.
I depart at 6:00 am and will update you Tuesday evening from Tegucigalpa.

U.S. offers new role for Pakistan
A BROADER PARTNERSHIP
Importance of country to Afghan effort recognized
By Karen DeYoung
Washington Post Staff Writer
Monday, November 30, 2009
President Obama has offered Pakistan an expanded strategic partnership, including additional military and
economic cooperation, while warning with unusual bluntness that its use of insurgent groups to pursue policy
goals "cannot continue."
The offer, including an effort to help reduce tensions between Pakistan and India, was contained in a two-page
letter delivered to President Asif Ali Zardari this month by Obama national security adviser James L. Jones. It
was accompanied by assurances from Jones that the United States will increase its military and civilian efforts
in Afghanistan and that it plans no early withdrawal.
Obama's speech Tuesday night at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., will address primarily the
Afghanistan aspects of the strategy. But despite the public and political attention focused on the number of new
troops, Pakistan has been the hot core of the months-long strategy review. The long-term consequences of
failure there, the review concluded, far outweigh those in Afghanistan.
"We can't succeed without Pakistan," a senior administration official involved in the White House review said.
"You have to differentiate between public statements and reality. There is nobody who is under any illusions
about this."
This official and others, all of whom spoke about the closely held details of the new strategy on the condition of
anonymity, emphasized that without "changing the nature of U.S.-Pakistan relations in a new direction, you're
not going to win in Afghanistan," as one put it. "And if you don't win in Afghanistan, then Pakistan will
automatically be imperiled, and that will make Afghanistan look like child's play."
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765810 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765810 Date: 07/31/2015
Proffered U.S. carrots, outlined during Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's October visit to Islamabad,
center on a far more comprehensive and long-term bilateral relationship. It would feature enhanced
development and trade assistance; improved intelligence collaboration and a more secure and upgraded military
equipment pipeline; more public praise and less public criticism of Pakistan; and an initiative to build greater
regional cooperation among Pakistan, India and Afghanistan.
Obama called for closer collaboration against all extremist groups, and his letter named five: al-Qaeda, the
Afghan Taliban, the Haqqani network, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and the Pakistani Taliban organization known as
Tehrik-e-Taliban. Using vague diplomatic language, he said that ambiguity in Pakistan's relationship with any
of them could no longer be ignored.
Jones, a retired Marine Corps general, was more precise in conversations with top Pakistani government and
military leaders, U.S. and foreign officials said, stating that certain things have to happen in Pakistan to ensure
Afghanistan's security. If Pakistan cannot deliver, he warned, the United States may be impelled to use any
means at its disposal to rout insurgents based along Pakistan's western and southern borders with Afghanistan.
Current U.S. policy includes the use of missiles fired from unmanned drones on insurgent locations limited to
roughly 50 miles inside the western border; training in two military camps for the Pakistani Frontier Corps; and
intelligence exchanges. It prohibits kinetic, or active, operations by U.S. ground forces inside Pakistan.
While praising Pakistani military offensives against groups that pose a domestic threat -- primarily the alliance
of groups known as Tehrik-e-Taliban, in the Swat Valley and South Waziristan -- Jones made it clear that the
administration expects more.
The rollout of the new strategy is being coordinated with principal U.S. allies, including Britain, whose prime
minister, Gordon Brown, said Sunday, "People are going to ask why, eight years after 2001, Osama bin Laden
has never been near to being caught."
"Al-Qaeda has a base in Pakistan," Brown said in an interview with Sky News. "That base is still there -- they
are able to recruit from abroad. The Pakistan authorities must convince us that they are taking all the action that
is necessary to deal with that threat."
Expansion of the U.S.-Pakistan relationship will require overcoming significant public and political mistrust in
both countries. Officials said that they recognize the difficulty in delivering on either U.S. promises or threats,
and that "our leverage over Pakistan is very limited," the senior administration official said.
At the same time, although the administration's goal is to demonstrate a new level and steadfastness of support,
short-term U.S. demands may threaten Pakistan's already fragile political stability.
"It's going to be a game of cat-and-mouse with them for a while," another official said, adding that "what we're
trying to do is to force them to recalculate" where their advantage lies.
The Pakistan strategy is complicated by a number of factors, including the fact that any indication of increased
U.S. involvement there generates broad mistrust. Zardari's political weakness is an additional hazard for a new
bilateral relationship. He is disliked by the military and is challenged by the political opposition and his own
prime minister; he also remains under a cloud of long-standing corruption charges. Less than a third of
Pakistan's population voices approval for him in polls. Obama is even less popular there, with approval ratings
in the low double digits.
Many of the broad powers that Zardari assumed from his predecessor, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who seized
power in a 1999 military coup and was forced to resign last year, are being whittled away. On Friday, Zardari

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765810 Date: 07/31/2015
turned over control of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal to Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani, who is held in much
higher favor by the military.
Zardari's Musharraf-era powers to fire the elected government and appoint top military officials are also under
challenge, and a law protecting government officials from corruption prosecution expired Saturday. On Sunday,
the leading political opposition group called for him to give up the additional powers, and Zardari, who had
pledged to do so, said he will act "soon." The administration expects Zardari's position to continue to weaken,
leaving him as a largely ceremonial president even if he manages to survive in office.
Senior U.S. officers, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, Adm. Mike Mullen, have made repeated
relationship-building trips to Pakistan, and training programs in this country for Pakistani officers are expanding
after being moribund for years.
U.S. officials have long referred to Pakistani military and intelligence officers who are sympathetic to or
actively support insurgent groups fighting in Afghanistan as "rogue elements." More recently, they have
described those relationships as more direct and institutional within a divided military. "For the things that we
care about," a U.S. official said, "the real decision-maker is the military." It has long been hedging its bets in
Afghanistan; the military has positioned itself to prevent inroads by India in the event of a U.S. withdrawal, and
against a 30-year history of being used and then rejected by shifting U.S. policy aims.
"Our game is to convince them that our commitment to Afghanistan and the region is long-term," the official
said of the military. "We're not going to pack up our bags and leave them as soon as we're done. We have to
create a situation in which they see a much more positive interest in closer relations with us than they do in
trying to play us. But it requires time."
India is skeptical of any U.S. involvement in its relationship with Pakistan. Bilateral attempts to resolve the
long-standing border dispute in Kashmir were put on hold after last year's terrorist attacks in Mumbai, which
were blamed on Lashkar-e-Taiba.
The group has long been active in the Kashmir conflict and is said to have close ties to Pakistan's Inter-Services
Intelligence agency.
Obama and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh treaded carefully on the issue in public during Singh's state
visit to Washington last week. "It is not the place of the United States to try to, from the outside, resolve all
those conflicts," Obama said during their news conference here. "On the other hand, we want to be encouraging
of ways in which both India and Pakistan can feel secure."

Here is rasmussen statement at press conf today:
On behalf of NATO, I warmly welcome President Obama's announcement on the new US approach and commitment to
the mission in Afghanistan. President Obama's decision to substantially increase the numbers of US forces in the NATO-
led operation is proof of his resolve; the overall approach he laid out is a broader political strategy for success. The
United States' contribution to the NATO-led mission has always been substantial; it is now even more important.But this
is not a US mission alone: America's Allies in NATO have shared the risks, costs and burdens of this mission from the
beginning. As the US increases its commitment, I am confident that the other Allies, as well as our Partners in the
mission, will also make a substantial increase in their contribution. Taken together, the new force contributions from
across the Alliance, as well as the new approach agreed by all the ISAF countries, will help create a new momentum in
the mission in 2010.

Subject: cairo +15 speech in early january
About six weeks ago, HRC agreed to give a speech commemorating the anniversary of the 1994 UN Conference on
Population and Development in Cairo. I believe the actual anniversary is December 18th so frankly, if we did the
speech in early January, we would not be that far off the mark. The idea would be to do this speech at State with the
audience including the NGOs, Gates Foundation, UN, and Packard Foundations. This speech could send a message
regarding the link between population and environmental sustainability and as a result, improve women's status and
rights. I would love to give them January 6th-8th if that works on your end.

Media reports Israeli President Peres collapsed at an event in Tel Aviv this evening.
President S'iliiT■011 Peres collapsed on Saturday night during a question-and-answer session for young executives at the
Rabin Center in Tel Aviv.
The 86-year-old president fainted and collapsed on the lectern during the last question. He recovered consciousness
after a fedV seconds, at which point he was taken to a side room where Magen David Adorn medics treated him.
The president's personal physician later rushed to the scene.
After the incident, people close to Peres told Haaretz that he was feeling "good," that he left the hall walking, and that
he hat a protracted debate with his aides about whether to go to hospital, which the president refused to do.
Peres was ultimately taken to the Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer for further treatment.

Subject: for S -- a stunning fact
The Quadrennial "America's Place in the World" survey conducted both generally among the
American public and among Council on Foreign Relations members found that "a plurality
of the (American) public now says that China, not the United States, is the world's leading
economic power. Currently, 44% of the public says China is the world's leading economic
power, while just 27% name the United States. As recently as the beginning of last year, 41%
said the U.S. was the top economic power while 3 0 % said China." On the brighter side,
'Despite widespread anxiety over the economy, public support for free trade agreements has
increased since 2008. A modest plurality now sees free trade agreements as good for the
U.S.; in April 2008, a plurality said such agreements were bad for the country." The two
sentiments may well be related, of course.

may be in Nairobi, but will find out asap where she is. Asha's family, husband and children, are generally resident in
Nairobi.) I've asked Michael to secure Kenyan police protection for the family while they are in Kenya and to explore
with Asha whether she is interested in looking for a way to come to the U.S. via some type of application for refugee
status. Michael will ask our consular officers to explore the options available if Asha wants to consider them.
I also alerted Michael to the fact that Asha's brother was seriously wounded in the bombing. I have asked that they get
a full name as soon as possible and to see what we can do through the TFG, the UN and AMISOM to have him flown to
Nairobi. Michael said that he and the embassy have already arranged for a private hospital in to treat the seriously
injured who are being arriving by special flights in Nairobi. If we can identify Asha's brother, we will give him priority.
Finally, Michael has spoken to Sheik Sharrif extended our condolences and encouraged his resolve. I will be speaking to

You were great tonight. Everyone was hugely energized. Not to take anything away from the speechwriters, but you
were at your best in the last 5 minutes speaking from the heart. That's what we have to bottle for the development
speech. This was a great way to tee it up. AM

This is probably entirely inappropriate, but I had gathered that you were thinking possibly of taking
off on Dec 21. I would urge you to — for your own sake. The pace is absolutely killing and you
deserve it. But it will also mean that a lot of folks who would like to take some time off with their
family before Xmas (e.g. moms like me who are necessary to make Xmas happen) would feel much
freer to do so. AM

Flew into Santo Domingo last night. Went overland to PaP. With Amb. Merten in Haiti.
About to do an aerial tour w/Amb. Planning on going out with S. Florida search and response teams. (Was former State
trooper so we think he has some experience in search and rescue, but cannot know for sure.) He's doing this on his
own, so we're not sure what he's planning.
His staff had been trying to persuade him not to travel for at least the immediate future, but it clearly didn't work. He
has received too many phone calls from constituents encouraging him to go.
Contacts in his office:
Clarence Williams Chief of Staff
Hassan Christian.
(Cell Phone)
(I've been talking to him.)

A big, warm hello and
As you may know, I signed up for hosting another holiday party with many Senate alum suggesting the idea as a way of
having a reunion and, hey, a party. We invited staff covering most of our years, and looks like a great collection will
come. It'll be pot-luck so not quite as elegant as before.
SO, just in case, and I'd imagine it's not possible, it'll be Monday night, 7:00 to 9:30, December 21.
No matter what, wanted you to know we are gathering yet again with our Senator Clinton bond.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen will replace Danish minister Connie Hedegaard
as president of the UN climate talks for a final summit session, the United Nations said. "With so many heads of state
and government having arrived it's appropriate that the Prime Minister of Denmark presides," Hedegaard told the 193-
nation meeting. "However, the Prime Minister has appointed me as his special representative and I will thus continue to
negotiate the...outcome with my colleagues," she said. She said the move was procedural. Separately, Hedegaard has
been criticized by African nations for favoring rich nations in the negotiations.

Subject: (AP) Brazil Supreme Court action delays return of 9-year-old boy to his U.S. father.
Colleagues, for your information:
The AP reports Thursday's ruling by Justice Marco Aurelio Mello is the result of a petition by the boy's Brazilian family
that he remain in Brazil until the court decides whether the boy's own testimony should be heard in the case. The ruling
suspends a Wednesday judgment by a lower court ordering that David Goldman be given custody of his son,
Sean. Because the Court goes into recess tomorrow, a ruling on whether the boy's testimony should be heard is not
likely before February. Media report the boy is expected to remain in Brazil at least until then.

Subject: Cuba
You will have seen Verma's note regarding Senator Menedez desire to speak to S re direct mail talks with Cuba and our
follow on talks with the Cubans and dissidents. He is upset tha he was not consulted and does not think he was briefed
sufficiently quickly.
WHA and H had briefed immediately on the direct mail talks, and had briefed HFAC on the follow on talks. We had
asked for time to brief SFRC but had not yet done so.
This should be a good news story. We engaged with the Cubans at the Vice-Minister level, breaking a several year
shunning of our Interest Section by the Cubans, traveled outside of Havana to view hurricane damage (thus breaking
through the barrier of no travel beyond a ten-mile perimeter), we pursued extradition of US fugitives in Cuba, and most
importantly, Bisa Williams (my DAS and the head of delegation) met with a broad range of dissidents, civil socity reps,
and bloggers.
This last point is worth highlighting. The last part of the trip came together late because we would not let the Cubans
condition our meetings or determine who we could or could not meet with. The Cubans finally allowed us to meet with
dissidents, something they have prevented EU and other visitors from doing. In other words, we have broken th mold
and put real pressure on others to do the same.
That said, our briefing and outreach could have been quicker and better coordinated. This has upset Senator Menedez.
We are sending Bisa up tomorrow to brief the SFRC.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) Washington's number two diplomat huddled with South Korean officials Wednesday to discuss
North Korea amid a flurry of diplomacy to get the communist regime to return to disarmament talks. Deputy Secretary
of State James Steinberg is on an Asian tour that has included stops in Vietnam, Malaysia and China. Steinberg met
South Korean presidential security adviser Kim Sung-hwan and chief nuclear envoy Wi Sung-lac on Wednesday
morning. He later paid a courtesy call to newly appointed Prime Minister Chung Un-chan.

Subject: (Reuters) Copenhagen accord was a "disaster", says Sweden
BRUSSELS - Despite months of preparation and strenuous international diplomacy, the talks boiled down to an inability
of the world's two largest emitters, the United States and China, to agree on headline fixed targets.
The 27 member states of the EU had gone into the talks with a unified position and with a plan for financing emissions
cuts in the developing world, with a commitment to spend around 7 billion euros ($10.01 billion) over the next three
years to aid poorer countries.
But those aims were largely sidelined as the talks failed to produce the breakthrough agreement many had hoped for.
"Europe never lost its aim, never, never came to splits or different positions, but of course this was mainly about other
countries really (being) unwilling, and especially the United States and China," said Carlgren.
Britain on Monday blamed China and a handful of other countries of holding the world to ransom by blocking a legally
binding treaty at Copenhagen, stepping up a blame game that has gathered momentum since the talks ended.
Prime Minister Gordon Brown described the summit as "at best flawed and at worst chaotic" and demanded an urgent
reform of the process to try to reach a legal treaty when talks are expected to resume in Germany next June.
But Danish Climate Minister Connie Hedegaard, who quit as president of the Copenhagen talks midway through after
being criticised by African countries for favouring wealthier nations in negotiations, said it was no time to get depressed
about the process of tackling climate change.
"What we need to do is to secure the step that we took and turn it into a result," she told reporters as she arrived for
the Brussels meeting on Tuesday. Asked whether Copenhagen had been a failure, she replied:
"It would have been a failure if we had achieved nothing. But we achieved something. A first step. It was the first time
we held a process where all the countries were present, including the big emitters."

Subject: (Reuters) China says Britain sowing discord in climate politics
BEIJING - China condemned claims ascribed to Britain's climate change minister that it had "hijacked" negotiations in
Copenhagen, saying on Tuesday the accusations were an attempt to sow discord among poor countries.
The sharp words from Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu were the latest baring of diplomatic bad blood
after the talks in Copenhagen ended on Saturday with a broad, non-binding accord that fell short of hopes for a robust
global agreement on how to curb greenhouse gas emissions.
Jiang was responding to a report in Britain's Guardian newspaper that said the Environment Minister Ed Miliband had
accused China, Sudan, Bolivia and other left-wing Latin American nations of "hijacking" efforts to reach deeper
agreement on how to fight global warming.
In a separate commentary for the paper, Miliband said China vetoed a widely supported proposal at the Copenhagen
talks to aim to cut global greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2050.
"We cannot again allow negotiations on real points of substance to be hijacked," he also wrote, but without singling out
China or any other country as a "hijacker."
Chinese spokeswoman Jiang did not chide Miliband by name, but Beijing's ire was clear.
"The statements from certain British politicians are plainly a political scheme," she said in a statement issued by the
official Xinhua news agency.
"Their objective is to shirk responsibilities that should be assumed towards developing countries, and to provoke discord
among developing countries. This scheme will come to nothing."
The flap is unlikely to seriously disrupt negotiations seeking to turn the Copenhagen accord into a legally binding treaty.
But the sour exchange has underscored the distrust between China and rich countries that could frustrate efforts to
agree on that treaty by late 2010.
"Everyone is raising the banner of protecting the planet, but in reality they are protecting their own interests," Wang Vi,
a climate change policy researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, told Reuters.
"The compromises (in Copenhagen) were very, very limited."
China is the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases from human activities and its biggest developing economy.
Other governments have pressed it to do more to reduce its growing emissions and to submit its emissions goals to
international checks as part of any new climate pact.
But China and other big developing countries have accused the rich economies of failing to offer big enough cuts to their
emissions, and of not offering enough money and technological help to poor countries to cope with climate change.
Chinese experts have also said the goal of cutting global greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2050 is empty
rhetoric without those commitments from rich nations.
"Currently, the most difficult issue to resolve is the scale and structure of each country's emissions reductions," said Li
Zhiqing, an environmental policy professor at Fudan University in Shanghai, writing in the city's Wenhui Daily
newspaper.
"Clearly, there will be no breakthrough on this in the near term and we can only maintain the status quo," wrote Li.

WASHINGTON - Senior House aides say freshman Democratic lawmaker Parker Griffith of Alabama is switching to the
Republican Party. Griffith was narrowly elected last year from a region of northern Alabama that includes Huntsville and
Decatur. President Barack Obama lost the district badly to Republican John McCain. Griffith is a radiation oncologist. His
switch comes as Congress is trying to pass a much-contested health care bill. Democrats will still control the House by a
substantial margin.

Hi Huma — could you please show this to the Secretary? Senator Reid's staff and Senator
Lautenberg would like the letter below sent to his office today. Upon receipt of the letter, we are
told Senator Lautenberg will lift his hold on the GSP and ATPDA trade legislation. I know the
Secretary would prefer to wait until there is a final decision in Brazil, but it is still unclear when
that decision will come (may not even be today) and we have drafted the letter so that it still makes
sense regardless of how and when the court rules. Thanks, and I'm at my desk if she wants to
discuss it further. Rich
Dear Senator Lautenberg,
I appreciated the opportunity to speak with you this past weekend regarding the custody case of
Sean Goldman, the young American boy wrongfully detained in Brazil for more than five
years. As we discussed, the Administration has long maintained that Sean should be reunited with
his father David in New Jersey. I have made a point of emphasizing this position with Brazilian
Foreign Minister Celso Amorim during our many conversations, as have other U.S. Officials with
their Brazilian counterparts.
We have worked closely with the Government of Brazil to ensure it upholds its obligations under
the Hague Convention on International Child Abduction. We were quite concerned by last week's
decision suspending the order reuniting Sean with his father. We were encouraged, however, by
the appeal filed last Friday by the Brazilian Solicitor General which challenges this
suspension. Like you, we are eager to learn of the outcome of this appeal. We understand a
decision could be announced shortly.
You can be assured that we will continue advocating for the reunification of Sean and his
father and pressing the Government of Brazil to ensure swift consideration of the Goldman case so
that this long legal process may reach a final conclusion without further delay. In the meantime,
please be assured that the State Department as well as the U.S. Embassy in Brasilia has been and
will continue to be a resource to the Goldman family during this trying time.
Sincerely,

Subject: Notes for S on Landler Chat
Mark Landler spoke to Jose Villarreal (the Commissioner General), Elizabeth and me in the last two
days. Mark seems to be going down the same road with all three of us. At first he knew very little about the
actual Expo but now he seems focused on the Secretary's role in bringing the USA Pavilion back to life. We all
agreed that he seems to be writing a favorable story.
He specifically wanted to know about her role and whether her "political" background helped her get there (
as opposed to a more traditional foreign affairs "career" Secretary). We thought that her political side helped
her immediately recognize that she had a real problem with the Chinese that needed to be fixed
immediately. As a problem-solving politico, she immediately went to work to fix it.
He also wanted to know if she used the WJC/HRC rolodex to raise money. We said no and noted that all of the
money is being raised in the business community and not by individuals. She did not go to her political fund-
raising base. We did not mention it but it is interesting that many of the early big sponsors were NY based
companies like GE (1
—), Pepsi ( ), Corning, Cummins, Deloitte, NYSE, and Pfizer.
He asked if S made individual calls to CEO's and we noted (as recd by L), the only general "asks" were done on
conference calls or in large groups. We also noted that she never really "asked" for sponsorships, instead she
stressed the importance of getting a formidable USA presence at the Shanghai Expo that is so important to the
Chinese and will attract 70 million people. This could be the largest event in human history and will go from
May 1 to October 31, 2010.
Talking Points
When S arrived at State, the USA and Andorra were the only two countries that did not sign a participation
agreement with the Chinese. We had less than $250,000 in the bank.
In just ten months, S assigned the Global Partnership Initiative office to lead the project, sent a signal to the
State Department bureaucracy that this was a priority and that we would participate, named a Commissioner
General, signed the participation agreement, asked Secretary Locke to break ground, raised $54.3 M to build
and operate it, and visited the actual construction site in November. The Pavilion is on target to be opened in
mid-April.

The article is good, just way too short, so it became very matter of fact, didn't include a lot of the great stuff he saw that

But for this readership, that length is probably perfect. It supposedly gets seen by 70 million people. 69 million
probably never open it up and just see it in their Sunday paper, so the cover is the ballgame. Story is basically an excuse
for the cover. And the cover is a homerun.
In the end, I firmly believe it will be the totality all these in-depth projects like Vogue, National Geographic, Nightline,

A scheduled 1100 EST press conference by the attorney for the Brazilian family did not take place. Damour reports the
attorneys from both sides are still negotiating the details of the handover, as is the attorney for the Government of
Brasil. According to the 2'd Regional Federal Court, the deadline for the turnover at the Consulate falls at 0600 local on
12/24. However, there may be a push to turn Sean over to the consulate today in order to permit him to travel to the
U.S. on an overnight flight.

Importance: High
I have just heard from the team in Rio that there will be no return enforcement this evening:
o Tomorrow morning between 8-9, David Goldman's Brazilian attorney will go to the court to obtain the warrant
enforcing the return of Sean Goldman to the U.S. He will wait there pending coordination with relevant police
and judicial authorities to ensure that everything is ready, and they will depart for the family compound to take
custody of Sean.
o Consulate General Rio will have cars ready at 9am for transport, and the team will be ready at the airport to
facilitate departure.
o David's attorney has spoken to judicial authorities and believes that the motions filed at STJ will not be accepted
by the court, so will not interfere with the return. This does not preclude some last minute legal maneuvers, but
he seems confident that the decision by STF will effectively cut off other avenues. We will advise asap if this
changes.
Blackberry service does appear to be down, so if there are any questions tonight, please contact me directly on my cell
at as I am getting offline in approximately five mins. We are 3 hours ahead of DC time at the

Subject: RE: Goldman Decision - update as of 00:45 local time
Given the hour here, I am less optimistic that we will pull off a return tonight, but we are still working to that end.
• The Brazilian Central Authority confirms that the office of Regional Federal Court President Paulo Espirito Santo
has received the decision of STF President Gilmar Mendes. It is Paulo E-S who will be responsible for enforcing
the decision from Mendes, i.e. the return of Sean Goldman to the U.S.
• BCA has promised to reinforce for Interpol the urgent necessity of police in Rio monitoring the location of Sean
Goldman. Embassy LEGAT office is double-tracking. We cannot, of course, ask them to enforce anything until
the proper judicial authority has sent them instructions, but we strongly urge them to be prepared.
• BCA has turned over operational jurisdiction to Daniel Levy, from the AGU's office in Rio, to coordinate with
David Goldman's attorney and with the court in Rio. I have asked David's attorney to try and get some
understanding from Mr. Levy as to the timeline we can expect to see in this case.
What remains unclear:
• We do not know if the judge from the Regional Federal Court intends to issue an execution order from his home
tonight at this late hour, or if he will wait until opening of business tomorrow morning. Note that 00B here
generally means 10am for a court. This only underscores the need to ensure that there is sufficient monitoring
of Sean's whereabouts.
• We do not know how Judge Paulo E-S will interpret an "immediate" return order — it could mean right this
instant, or it could mean some brief period of time where the family is ordered/encouraged to turn Sean over at
the Consulate or some other site.
• We are working to obtain some sense of whether this is likely to happen tonight, or if we are better served
getting some rest now and starting first thing 008 which for us means 7-8am.
• We have not had confirmation regarding the resolution of the motions in STJ, but frankly, I don't foresee
receiving an answer on that before mid-day Wednesday.

If the family sees the writing on the wall (frankly unlikely at this point) and agrees to abide by the order of immediate
return, then in theory the handover would happen at the consulate and there is a plan in place for that.
Plans in motion to prevent them slipping away and Patricia Lamego is working with the police as we speak. Federal
Police repeatedly assured us they were prepped and ready to move but could take no action absent an order. They
know now there is one, so BCA will get them moving.
If the handover occurred tonight, I'm told we need 3 hours to get the plane off the ground, so overnight in the hotel.

Marie, if there is a handover tonight: that would be at the Consulate in Rio, right? Grandparents would bring Sean and
he'd spend the night...in David's hotel or at the Consulate?
It seems very, very unlikely that will happen tonight.
But if handover is delayed until morning, the family may try to slip away tonight. Can we ask the police to prevent that?

Here is what we know:
• STF Pres. Gilmar Mendes upheld the motion by the AGU and David's attorney requesting he overturn the stay
imposed by Justice Marco Aurelio, based upon a motion filed by the maternal grandmother.
• The order at first read appears to require immediate return of Sean.
• The BCA is calling the Interpol director responsible for enforcing such actions to see if they will get set to
move. HOWEVER, BCA does not/not yet have a copy of the order, and it is the judge in the lower court in Rio
that would generally receive the order from STF and then contact DPF to enforce.
• Sergio Brito, the prosecutor who has assisted David's attorney on the Hague case is attempting to contact the
judge in the court of first instance in an effort to move as quickly as possible. Note that the court of first

of the status of the case and may be prepared to move this evening.
• BCA is hoping to effect handover tonight, and will plan to send their psychologist to Rio if the handover must
happen tomorrow morning.
What we don't know:
• No details yet on what else is contained in the order, which is likely to affect the next steps taken by the
Brazilian family.
• No details as yet on what, if anything the Brazilian family has done in response to the news from STF.

I just spoke with Marie Damour, CG at Embassy Brasilia, who provided an update on the Goldman case.
A scheduled 1100 EST press conference by the attorney for the Brazilian family did not take place. Damour reports the
attorneys from both sides are still negotiating the details of the handover, as is the attorney for the Government of
Brasil. According to the 2nd Regional Federal Court, the deadline for the turnover at the Consulate falls at 0600 local on
12/24. However, there may be a push to turn Sean over to the consulate today in order to permit him to travel to the
U.S. on an overnight flight.
Damour will continue to update as events progress.

Dan,
I just got off the phone with Embassy Brasilia Charge Lisa Kubiske, who provided a recap of current developments in the
Goldman child custody case. Summarizing:
-- David Goldman's Brazilian lawyer and the family's attorney are currently attempting to negotiate an "voluntary
return."
--If those talks fail, Goldman will request the Brazilian police execute the involuntary return ordered yesterday by a
Brazilian judge. This outcome would create a negative PR climate.
--Brazilian police "think" they know the boy's whereabouts.
--Return to US likely will occur on an NBC News-chartered aircraft, as Goldman has inked some sort of exclusive deal w/
NBC for the story.

I have just heard from the team in Rio that there will be no return enforcement this evening:
Tomorrow morning between 8-9, David Goldman's Brazilian attorney will go to the court to obtain the warrant
enforcing the return of Sean Goldman to the U.S. He will wait there pending coordination with relevant police and
judicial authorities to ensure that everything is ready, and they will depart for the family compound to take custody of
Sean.
• Consulate General Rio will have cars ready at 9am for transport, and the team will be ready at the airport to
facilitate departure.
David's attorney has spoken to judicial authorities and believes that the motions filed at ST1 will not be accepted by
•
the court, so will not interfere with the return. This does not preclude some last minute legal maneuvers, but he seems
confident that the decision by STF will effectively cut off other avenues. We will advise asap if this changes.
Blackberry service does appear to be down, so if there are any questions tonight, please contact me directly on my cell
at as I am getting offline in approximately five mins. We are 3 hours ahead of DC time at the
moment, but please do not hesitate to call.

Subject: Visa for India
Dear Huma,
As I explained on the phone, we've hit a brick wall in trying to get a visa for my son to travel to
India. We are scheduled to leave on Saturday, December 26, but without a visa he of course cannot go and I will not go
without him. My visa has been issued by Travisa Outsourcing, the company to which the Government of India has
outsourced all visa processing. However, despite the fact that Travisa does all of India's visa processing, and ordinarily
does it on a same-day basis, their office here in Washington, DC (located in Georgetown) refused to process my son's
visa application because he is a California resident and they are organized so that their various offices (New York,
Washington, San Francisco, Chicago, and
Houston) issue visas only for residents of the immediate vicinity of the particular office. Thus, for example, the
Washington office issues visas for residents of Delaware, Washington, DC, Maryland, West Virginia, and the like, but will
not process visas for residents beyond this area. The New York office, likewise, processes visas only for residents of New
York, New Jersey, CT, and the like, but not Washington. My son of course has a valid US passport, but the visa
requirements also require proof of residence, and because his driver's license is a California license (because that is his
residence), Travisa Outsourcing said they could not process his visa application.
They insisted that he have proof of DC residence, even though he is my son and I am a DC resident. (If he were my
minor child, or my spouse, they would have let him travel with me, but he is 30 years old and so they insist on evaluating
his residency documents independently of mine even though we are traveling together.)
We went to the DC Motor Vehicle Department after leaving Travisa Outsourcing to see whether he could get a non-
driver's photo ID issued by the District but that could only be done if he relinquished his California driver's license, which
of course he was not prepared to do. (Even to find that out, we had to first go to the Social Security Administration to
get proof of his SSN, which of course he has in California but not with him, and then we went back to the DMV only to
learn that a non-driver's ID here was not a realistic option.)
We then went to the Embassy of India, at 2536 Mass. Ave., NW, which is the part of the embassy that deals with
passports and consular affairs. They do not handle visas, of course, because that has been outsourced to Travisa.
Nonetheless, I had hoped that we might get someone at the Embassy to agree to issue his visa here in Washington.
Although two polite gentlemen did speak to us, they insisted that his
visa could be issued only in San Francisco. Given the imminence of
the Christmas holidays and the impossibility of doing this either in person (he is already in Washington for Christmas and
thus he cannot get back to California to get his visa issued there and still get back to Washington for the holiday and our
departure from Washington on Saturday, Decemberr 26th) or by FedEx because of holiday closings, we have no choice
but to cancel our trip to India. This is a trip we planned together and I will not go without him, and the holidays mean
that we cannot realistically rearrange his flights to follow mine because, by the time he had a visa, the trip would be half
over.
I am not sure what can be done as I recognize that the decision is up to the Government of India but, as I mentioned, I
thought it was worth asking whether there was any way in which you might assist us. Should that prove possible, his
pertinent information (the information required by Travisa) is:
Type of visa requested - tourist Purpose of trip - vacation Places to be
visited - Delhi, Udaipur, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Agra He has never been to India before and is not traveling on behalf of any
company, nor is he holding a valid "no objection to return to India" endorsement (a question asked on Travisa's form)

David Goldman, Rep Smith, David's attorneys and Mission personnel all safe at Consulate. Still set for 9am handover.
Consulate will allow Sergio Tostes, attorney for the Brazilian family, into the building along with Sean and his
grandmother, Silvana. We have arranged for the party to enter directly into the building via the garage. The
grandmother announced to the press her intention to "park 3 blocks away, as the consulate would not allow her in" but
press are quoting the Embassy spokesperson Orna Blum flatly contradicting that statement, emphasizing that for Sean's
emotional well-being, and in sensitivity to Silvana and David, the reunion be safe, private, and calm.
Court officials and the attorney for the GOB, Daniel Levy Alvarenga will also be at at the consulate to assist in the
turnover.

Importance: High
• It appears there will be no handover tonight. According to David's Brazilian attorney, the negotiators have
broken up, having not been able to agree on the issue of the Grandmother accompanying Sean to the U.S. on
the plane (clearly, the other side remains unaware of the source/nature of the charter flight that is pending a
handover). We have rebuffed attempts by the Brazilian family's attorney to "get clarification from the
Americans" as an obvious last-ditch ploy to once again present this as a U.S. vs Brazil issue. We have been clear
to all parties that we the Mission have absolutely no role in any negotiation between the parties and will
not/not undertake any contact with the family or their representatives.
• Deadline for handover established by the President of the 2nd Regional Federal Court in Rio remains 9am
Thursday morning at the U.S. Consulate. Brazilian Central Authority confirms that the warrant authorizing
enforcement of the order has been issued and should be in the possession of law enforcement should the family
not comply. BCA has confirmed they will be in early tomorrow morning, ready to arrange enforcement should

that be necessary. However, David's attorney believes they will comply with the order and appear at the
Consulate. We stand ready for multiple scenarios.
• In good news, the Brazilian Central Authority reported that the judge assigned to hear the two motions filed by
attorneys for the Brazilian family in the Superior Tribunal de Justica (STJ) has denied both motions on the merits,
not just refused to consider the motions. Links to the decisions for those who wish to read legal Portuguese are
provided below.
• The frequently-announced press conference by the Brazilian family/their attorney never materialized. We await
word on their next public relations foray.
• We will stand down support staff in Rio at an appropriate hour so they can get some well-earned rest, and be
prepared to start again early tomorrow morning.

Subject: RE: Goldman Decision - update as of 13:00 local time
Importance: High
I have just spoken with the Brazilian Central Authority regarding the orders imminently coming out of the office of the
President of the 2nd Regional Federal Court. He is evidently interpreting the lifting of the stay imposed at STF to mean
that the 48 hour period provided in the appellate court decision to the Brazilian family to turn over Sean to the
Consulate has started ticking again — not restarted at the beginning, but resumed ticking. According to the Court, the
deadline for turnover at the Consulate falls at 6am local time on Thursday morning, December 24. Because of the early
hour, he will evidently order the family to turn over Sean at the consulate NO LATER than 9am on Thursday, December
24. However, he will also recommend, not order, that the family turn over Sean at the Consulate today/tonight in order
to permit him to travel to the U.S. on an overnight flight and spend Christmas with the family in the U.S.
There is current debate ongoing regarding the timing of the turnover. Daniel Levy of the AGU office in Rio will evidently
take the lead in negotiating that turnover, in conjunction with David's legal team.
Press contacts are stating that Sergio Tostes, the attorney for the Brazilian family, has called a press conference at 2pm
local time (11am DC time) to announce voluntary turnover. No further details on that yet.

Subject: Goldman Decision - update as of 10:30 local time
Importance: High
Good news this morning:
• Brazilian Central Authority reports that at lam local time today, the attorney for the Brazilian family contacted
Daniel Levy, the AGU attorney representing the Brazilian Govt in this case, to inform him that the Brazilian family
is willing to arrange for voluntary turnover of Sean at the Consulate General in Rio. Daniel Levy reportedly
replied that he would only facilitate these discussions on the condition that there were no further legal
machinations to delay implementation of the court order, and that the turnover happened today. We do
not/not know what if any conditions the family will try to place on a voluntary handover, so planning for police
execution of the court order continues.
o Interpol office in Brasilia has assured BCA and the Embassy LEGAT that they are fully aware of the status of the
case and are ready to provide support if Sean is not turned over. They will have action if the family attempts to
hide Sean.
o We have contacted WHA Press and CA Press separately to discuss timing to release statements if/when we are
successful with wheels up.
O We have discussed detailed contingency plans should the police be called upon to go to the family residence to
enforce the order if voluntary handover does not occur. Also have plans in place to supplement personnel in Rio
should this extend past today.
O We have a general sense of the timing of potential events: We expect to have more clarity from the attorneys
as to whether or not voluntary handover will occur around noon/1pm local time, which is 9/10 DC time. Should
police enforcement be required, that will likely mean mid/late afternoon local time. We will advise asap if this
timeline shifts (as it is likely to do, this being Brazil.)
We will try to send updates every 2 hours or so, even if nothing of note has occurred. As always, please advise if there
are any specific questions or concerns.

Importance: High
I have just heard from the team in Rio that there will be no return enforcement this evening:
O Tomorrow morning between 8-9, David Goldman's Brazilian attorney will go to the court to obtain the warrant
enforcing the return of Sean Goldman to the U.S. He will wait there pending coordination with relevant police

and judicial authorities to ensure that everything is ready, and they will depart for the family compound to take
custody of Sean.
• Consulate General Rio will have cars ready at 9am for transport, and the team will be ready at the airport to
facilitate departure.
• David's attorney has spoken to judicial authorities and believes that the motions filed at ST1 will not be accepted
by the court, so will not interfere with the return. This does not preclude some last minute legal maneuvers, but
he seems confident that the decision by STF will effectively cut off other avenues. We will advise asap if this
changes.
Blackberry service does appear to be down, so if there are any questions tonight, please contact me directly on my cell
at as I am getting offline in approximately five mins. We are 3 hours ahead of DC time at the
moment, but please do not hesitate to call.

Subject: RE: Goldman Decision - update as of 00:45 local time
Given the hour here, I am less optimistic that we will pull off a return tonight, but we are still working to that end.
o The Brazilian Central Authority confirms that the office of Regional Federal Court President Paulo Espirito Santo
has received the decision of STF President Gilmar Mendes. It is Paulo E-S who will be responsible for enforcing
the decision from Mendes, i.e. the return of Sean Goldman to the U.S.
o BCA has promised to reinforce for Interpol the urgent necessity of police in Rio monitoring the location of Sean
Goldman. Embassy LEGAT office is double-tracking. We cannot, of course, ask them to enforce anything until
the proper judicial authority has sent them instructions, but we strongly urge them to be prepared.
• BCA has turned over operational jurisdiction to Daniel Levy, from the AGU's office in Rio, to coordinate with
David Goldman's attorney and with the court in Rio. I have asked David's attorney to try and get some
understanding from Mr. Levy as to the timeline we can expect to see in this case.
What remains unclear:
o We do not know if the judge from the Regional Federal Court intends to issue an execution order from his home
tonight at this late hour, or if he will wait until opening of business tomorrow morning. Note that 00B here
generally means 10am for a court. This only underscores the need to ensure that there is sufficient monitoring
of Sean's whereabouts.
o We do not know how Judge Paulo E-S will interpret an "immediate" return order — it could mean right this
instant, or it could mean some brief period of time where the family is ordered/encouraged to turn Sean over at
the Consulate or some other site.
o We are working to obtain some sense of whether this is likely to happen tonight, or if we are better served
getting some rest now and starting first thing 00B which for us means 7-8am.
(1. We have not had confirmation regarding the resolution of the motions in STJ, but frankly, I don't foresee
receiving an answer on that before mid-day Wednesday.

PLEASE NOTE — I am aware of the intense interest back in DC about this case and will be passing information just as soon
as I receive it. This means that in most cases, I will not be able to confirm the information. Will try to identify credible
sources vice what rumor/press/others are saying.
Brazilian Central Authority (BCA) coordinating with David's attorney and the Federal attorneys in Rio to ensure that the
President of the Regional Federal Court in Rio has a copy of the STF order and is submitting the official request to federal
police to enforce. BCA says they still believe they can effect the turnover tonight and are at their office working to that
end. If/when the Federal Police enforce, their stated preference is to go to the airport and effect the handover
there. This is a scenario we've planned for.
BCA has mentioned the STJ motions filed by the Brazilian family as a potential obstacle, but thru their contacts in
Mendes' office at STF, have heard that Mendes intends to reach out to the reporting judge at STJ to resolve that
issue. As mentioned in an earlier update today, we have not had any confirmation that the STJ judge has accepted to
hear the motions filed by the Brazilian family, and has the option to decline to hear them.

If the family sees the writing on the wall (frankly unlikely at this point) and agrees to abide by the order of immediate
return, then in theory the handover would happen at the consulate and there is a plan in place for that.
Plans in motion to prevent them slipping away and Patricia Lamego is working with the police as we speak. Federal
Police repeatedly assured us they were prepped and ready to move but could take no action absent an order. They
know now there is one, so BCA will get them moving.
If the handover occurred tonight, I'm told we need 3 hours to get the plane off the ground, so overnight in the hotel.

Marie, if there is a handover tonight: that would be at the Consulate in Rio, right? Grandparents would bring Sean and
he'd spend the night...in David's hotel or at the Consulate?
It seems very, very unlikely that will happen tonight.
But if handover is delayed until morning, the family may try to slip away tonight. Can we ask the police to prevent that?

Importance: High
Here is what we know:
• STF Pres. Gilmar Mendes upheld the motion by the AGU and David's attorney requesting he overturn the stay
imposed by Justice Marco Aurelio, based upon a motion filed by the maternal grandmother.
• The order at first read appears to require immediate return of Sean.
• The BCA is calling the Interpol director responsible for enforcing such actions to see if they will get set to
move. HOWEVER, BCA does not/not yet have a copy of the order, and it is the judge in the lower court in Rio
that would generally receive the order from STF and then contact DPF to enforce.
• Sergio Brito, the prosecutor who has assisted David's attorney on the Hague case is attempting to contact the
judge in the court of first instance in an effort to move as quickly as possible. Note that the court of first
instance is on recess and the "duty court" judge will need to take action, but magistrates in Rio are keenly aware
of the status of the case and may be prepared to move this evening.
• BCA is hoping to effect handover tonight, and will plan to send their psychologist to Rio if the handover must
happen tomorrow morning.
What we don't know:
• No details yet on what else is contained in the order, which is likely to affect the next steps taken by the
Brazilian family.
• No details as yet on what, if anything the Brazilian family has done in response to the news from STF.
Embassy staff are in the room with David's Brazilian attorney and will report just as soon as we have any details to
offer. Please advise me if you have any specific questions we need to pose to the team.

Subject: FW: END OF THE GOLDMAN CASE
I thought I would share this heartfelt message from Patricia Lamego de Teixeira Soares, the head of Brazil's Central
Authority, the office responsible for Hague Convention abduction cases. You will see that in spite of our efforts to
protect the son, the Brazilian family chose to make a spectacle outside the Consulate this morning by parading Sean
through a crowd. Ms. Lamego recently visited the U.S. where she met with members of Congress and others to explain
all that the Brazilian Central Authority was doing to reunite Sean and his father under the Hague Convention. The
delays we saw in this case were largely the result of a wealthy, well connected family able to influence court decisions.
We are all relieved and thrilled to see this long overdue but very happy ending. I should also highlight the amazing
work done by US Mission Brazil. The consular staff, Charge, Acting DCM (Marie Damour, the Consul General in Brasilia),
LegATT, RSO, and a host of others all played a role in this successful return. My OCS DAS, Michele Bond, and her
dedicated team also played a big role in communicating with David, his lawyers, Congress, and the press. We had
Members of Congress, former Assistant Secretaries and US Ambassadors all pitching in. While there were

disagreements at times over tactics, we all agreed that we were working towards the same goal: the safe return of
Sean.
We particularly appreciate the strong support from the Secretary. Many people will try to take credit for today's happy
reunion but it was the Secretary's continued concern and interest in this case that made the difference. We could not
have provided a better gift to David Goldman during this season of giving. Janice

Dear All,
The Goldman case finally came to an end, and despite the efforts of all involved the hand over of the child to the US
Consulate in Rio was transformed into a deplorable display of the child walking in the streets with the maternal family,
being exposed to the media and to the public that surrounded the consulate.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766784 Date: 08/31/2015
I'm sorry this had to happen but it seems that Mr. Sergio Tostes, the maternal family's attorney, did not feel at all
embarrased to use and expose the child, who was probably under severe stress, in order to gather support for his
position. This most despicable man is not accepting the fact that, despite his life long relationships with influential
authorities in Brazil, he was unable to win the case and Sean is finally being reunited with his only real father.
I just hope that David and the Goldman family find enough time to recover their lives and their relationship with Sean.
They need time more than anything else and now it is up to the US government to guarantee that David Goldman will
not have to face the maternal family once again in the US courts where, according to Mr. Tostes last declaration to the
Brazilian press, he will "fight to defend the child".
Please allow David Goldman to live in peace with his son and have the life that he deserves after fighting so much for so
many years. "
In my name and in the name of all the staff of the Brazilian Central Authority I wish David, Sean, and their family all the
best and a most happy life once they are finally back in the United States.
And to all of you who worked so much in support of this case, our deepest gratitude. We wish you all a Merry Christmas
and a very Happy New Year.

As Haiti recovers, give children special attention
*By Irwin Redlener*
Given the extraordinary destruction wrought by last month's earthquake
in Haiti, few will be surprised if this catastrophe is recorded as one
of the deadliest natural disasters in recent history. But what is not
well appreciated is that this disaster could disproportionately impact
children, not only those who perished in the initial shocks, but also
those who will not survive what is likely to be a cruel aftermath.
*Photo gallery:*
<http://mediagallery.usatoday.com/A-long-journey-out-of-Haiti-/G1436> As
Haiti struggled to pull itself together in the days immediately
following the 7.0 earthquake that hit the island nation, one Iowa family
was waiting to hear whether the child they had pledged to adopt three
years ago was still alive.
Before the quake, many of the 380,000 children living in shelters
<http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2010-01-24-haiti-children_N.htm>
were placed there out of economic desperation; families could not afford
to care for them. Now, many more children displaced by the earthquake
will literally have no surviving family members, further swelling demand
on social service agencies throughout the country.
*Kids at risk*
As the U.S. and other countries make plans to help Haiti get back on its
feet, emphasis should be on enhancing that nation's resiliency — and
that will mean dealing with the needs of- its children. The unusual
extent of child casualties will be driven by several factors:

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766861 Date: 08/31/2015
• About 50% of the Haitian population of 9 million is younger than 18
<http://www.uniceforg/emerg/haiti_52590.html>. Even more striking is
the fact that children 14 years of age and less make up more than 38%.
• Everything about a natural disaster puts children at greater risk. A
comparatively small chunk of dislodged ceiling would injure an adult,
but it might well kill an infant or small child. Water deprivation will
lead far more rapidly to dehydration and shock in an infant than it
would in an adult.
• Some seriously injured children have survived the initial trauma
because they were among the few to get surgical attention provided by
international medical teams. But access to follow-up care could be an
overwhelming challenge. Compounding concerns, the Ministry of Health at
one point asked physicians not to provide medical care
<http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2010-01-27-1Acomfort27_CV_N.htm>
that can't be sustained in Haiti.
*Long-term needs*
Between 1 million to 2 million Haitians will be "displaced" for the
foreseeable future. This means a minimum of 400,000 to 800,000 children
will be in temporary shelter for months or years. But the rainy season
is coming in May, followed by hurricane season in June. Families in
tents or other flimsy shelters will be at grave risk.
• What about the psychological impact? Grieving over loss and trauma
carries the potential of long-term consequences for every Haitian,
especially the countless children.
Then there are Haiti's chronic problems that must be addressed head-on.
For decades, Haitians have experienced a seemingly intractable state of
poverty, accompanied by malnutrition and high rates of acute and chronic
illness. More than 50% of Haitians live on less than a dollar a day, and
. more than 60% of its young children have nutritional anemia.
Despite the efforts of international agencies and non-governmental
organizations, chronic illness abounds and access to clean water,
medical care and sanitation remains a significant challenge for
Haitians, particularly children.
This is why the recovery and rebuilding of this fragile nation must
begin and end with a central focus on the immediate and long-term needs
of children. If there is to be a glimmer of hope for Haiti, it will be
because the international community understands that the capacity to
rise from the ashes of catastrophe is directly related to the health,
well-being and potential of its youngest generation.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Taliban insurgents had planned to use five Americans, now detained in Pakistan, who had
contacted the militants via the Internet, to carry out attacks in the U.S.-allied country, a police official said. Usman
Anwar, police chief in Sargodha, where the men were arrested this month, said emails had revealed plans for the young
men from Virginia to travel to a Pakistani nuclear power plant. "We believe that they were supposed to be used inside
Pakistan," Anwar told Reuters by telephone. "In their last email to the Taliban, we found they mentioned the Chashma

On another note I wanted to send congratulations to you on the announcement of your daughters engagement. I know
you are proud of her and rightfully so.
Also I had dinner last night with a mutual friend of ours, Sen Lindsay Graham. Lindsay always talks how much he likes
you and said if I were to be in contact with you to say hi from him.
Stay well and I look forward to hearing and seeing you soon.

The Lithuanian FM just told me the Community of Democracies is July 9-11 in Cracow, Poland. I have to go since I
promised the Polish FM but had hoped they would schedule July 2-4. Can you check w EUR and DRL to see if dates can
be moved? If not I can only go for the 9th since Let's see if there is
any give. I would also go to other places first during that week in Europe, including Warsaw for a bilateral meeting.
Also, am I doing a video to congratulate Lithuania on the 20th anniversary of their Independence on March 11?

terrorism, and will seek life imprisonment sentences against them. A senior police investigator in Sargodha said the men
would appear in an anti-terrorist court on Jan. 4. He said police had almost concluded their investigation and that they
were "certain that these five Americans wanted to carry out attacks in Pakistan." Gujar didn't say what authorities

Hi Huma — I hope everything is going OK in NYC.
Attached is the latest version of Doha. As you can imagine, I'm getting edits from about 20 people, so this document will
surely change in small ways between now and tomorrow morning. There are also placeholders where people are still
getting me info, and I still working on the conclusion.
But beyond those minor additions and some changes around the margins, this is unlikely to change much (unless the
Secretary wants it to, of course). I'm available all day and night for any edits from her or you. Please feel free to call.
Thanks Huma,
Megan

SANAA (AP) - Security officials say Yemeni forces have killed two suspected al-Qaida militants in a raid outside the
capital. The officials say security forces attacked a group of militants, which included Nazeeh al-Hanaq, a senior figure
on Yemen's most wanted list. The clash took place on Monday as the militants were moving through the mountainous
area of Arhab. They say al-Hanaq escaped but two fighters with him were killed in the clashes. The officials spoke on
condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the press.

Soaring cost of healthcare sets a record By Noam N. Levey February 4, 2010 Los Angeles Times
Spending was 17.3% of the economy last year. The share paid by the U.S. will soon exceed 50%, a study says.
In a stark reminder of growing costs, the government has released a new estimate that healthcare spending grew to a
record 17.3% of the U.S. economy last year, marking the largest one-year jump in its share of the economy since the
government started keeping such records half a century ago.
The almost $2.5 trillion spent in 2009 was $134 billion more than the previous year, when healthcare consumed 16.2%
of the gross domestic product, according to an annual report by independent actuaries at the federal Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, scheduled for release Thursday.
The nonpartisan accounting agency also projected that as early as next year, the country could mark another milestone
as government picks up more than half of the nation's total healthcare tab for the first time.
The rise in current costs, driven in part by surging spending in Medicare and Medicaid, and the bleak projections for the
future do not take into account changes that may come if Democrats revive their healthcare overhaul legislation.
The report appears likely to fuel further debate about the health bills now stalled in Congress.
In the absence of change, the report raises a grim prospect for the country -- a healthcare system consuming an ever
greater and potentially unsustainable share of the economy even as private health coverage lags.
Last year, CMS estimated that government spending on healthcare would not overtake private spending until 2016,
compared with 2011 or 2012 in the current report.
"The health system is hurting, and we are seeing that in these numbers," said Karen Davis, president of the
Commonwealth Fund, a leading authority on healthcare policy.
The report also points up the financial cost of the so-called Great Recession and the growing pressure it is putting on
state and local governments.
Federal and state spending on Medicaid, the nation's primary health insurance program for low-income Americans,
jumped nearly 10% in 2009, according to the report. Medicare spending, meanwhile, shot up just over 8%.
Obama and many healthcare experts have argued that reshaping the healthcare system will ultimately make it more
efficient, even if overall health spending continues to increase -- a claim Republicans dispute.
Fueled by new technology, an aging population, rising incomes and other changes, spending on medical care has been
consuming a larger and larger share of the nation's economy for years, jumping from about 5% of the gross domestic
product in 1960 to nearly 14% in 2000.
But the recession that began in 2007 accelerated that trend, as the economy contracted while healthcare spending
continued to increase, according to CMS.

Even now, with the economy slowly recovering, the government expects that the growth of healthcare spending will
outpace the expansion of the economy. By 2020, 1 of every 5 dollars spent in the U.S. is expected to go to healthcare.
Some economists believe that this is not necessarily a problem, as the healthcare industry can provide good jobs and
improve both health and productivity.
But there is growing concern that as much as a third of the medical care delivered in this country does not help patients.
"Are we getting value for the dollar? That is the question," said Len Nichols, health policy director at the centrist New
America Foundation. "If you believe that so much medical care is unnecessary, as I do, then it is criminal that we are
spending so much."
Stuart Butler, vice president for domestic and economic policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that the
numbers underscore the need for more aggressive action to curb spending.
"The only way to do this is to simply spend less," Butler said, warning that the health bills being pushed on Capitol Hill do
the opposite.
CMS officials noted that healthcare spending has been increasing even as the number of Americans without health
insurance is growing, another sign of problems with the system.
"With higher unemployment, people lose their jobs [and] many of them lose their healthcare coverage in the process.
And under current law, they don't have much to fall back on," said Richard S. Foster, chief actuary.
Foster said that the report by his office indicated that two of the main trends driving calls for a health overhaul -- rising
costs and shrinking numbers of people with health coverage -- are essentially the same as they were when the
healthcare debate began last year.
"Nothing much has changed in that regard," he said.
Inefficiency is becoming a particularly acute problem for state and federal governments, which the report shows are
increasingly supporting the nation's healthcare system.
Half a century ago, government accounted for just a quarter of all healthcare spending. Now, as the cost of caring for
elderly and poor Americans swells, government's share of the total bill is fast becoming greater than that of the private
sector.
The trend accelerated in the recession, as Washington spent billions of dollars to help states prop up Medicaid programs
being strained by the growing ranks of the unemployed and uninsured.
The healthcare legislation being debated on Capitol Hill could increase the government commitment to healthcare as
the federal government boosts the Medicaid program and provides billions of dollars of subsidies to low- and moderate-
income Americans to help them buy insurance.
But in a separate report a month ago, CMS actuaries estimated that the Senate healthcare bill would boost total
healthcare spending by less than 1% over the next decade, in large part because the legislation includes initiatives to
make Medicare more efficient.

The Secretary's Phone Call with Egyptian President Mubarak
Background: S/E Mitchell met with Foreign Minister Aboul Gheit and EGIS Chief Omar Solimon on January 24 in Cairo.
While Solimon responded positively to S/E Mitchell's request that Egypt encourage Palestinian President Abbas to agree
to proximity talks, Aboul Gheit asserted that the Palestinians should not agree to any form of negotiations until Israel
has taken action on the "five steps" requested by the Palestinians. Aboul Gheit then hosted a meeting on February 3
with Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and Jordanian FM Nasser Judeh, which Solimon attended in part. Egypt and
Jordan agreed to support the Palestinians entry into proximity talks, but the three sides also agreed that Abbas would
seek U.S. views on two questions: 1) The terms of reference for the proximity talks and 2) Whether the U.S. would
present its own bridging proposals on final status issues or simply serve as a conduit for the parties' positions. Deputy
Envoy David Hale met with Abbas on February 5, during which Abbas indicated flexibility on both the terms of reference
(he would accept a general formula based on language from the Roadmap) and on the U.S. role. You should emphasize
that it is critical that Abbas agree to begin proximity talks immediately to lay the foundation for negotiations that will
realize Palestinian aspirations for an independent and viable state.

Cheryl,
As of this hour of Thursday night there is no deal on an ironclad, substantive, political platform of national solidarity and
governance reform, in return for Abdullah's gracious concession which would obviate the constitutional and political
need for a problematic rd round.
Karl and I remain in close touch with the candidates as they continue their engagement. But short of a miracle, there
will be no such deal at least until Friday evening or Saturday morning, if then.
Hence, as we understand the exigencies of our Boss's travel sked, it appears to be time to pull the plug: we won't be
recommending before our Friday evening that she make a stop in Kabul on Saturday. The default remains: no Kabul
stop.
Nonetheless, Abdullah has now set Saturday as the date for his address to the nation, and Karzai clearly wants both for
him to concede, and to attract a visit of the Secretary. The best scenario would have been an announcement in the
presence of the Secretary, as a trusted witness to whom the parties would be more or less politically accountable. If we
get happy news by Saturday morning and the Boss can't come then, or perhaps a day or two later on route home from
the ME, then we'll likely be recommending that she again phone each of the two protagonists, followed by a positive
public statement.

The negotiators have concluded a text that has been approved by Micheletti and Zelaya. We are preparing the official
minute that will soon be signed by the negotiators. Micheletti is announcing now on the television that the deal has
been struck.
We will send more soon. The bottom line: I cannot think of another example of in Latin America where a country,
having suffered a rupture of its democratic and constitutional order, has overcome that rupture through negotiation and
without violence.
S can and should take pride that her launching of the SJA, her firm support of the OAS role, her constant outreach to the
major players, and her willingness to send us here created the conditions necessary for this accomplishment.

S can announce the breakthrough. She should say something like:
-- I welcome news of a breakthrough in negotiations in Honduras.
-- I congratulate the Honduran people, President Zelaya, and Mr. Micheletti for this historic agreement.
-- I also congratulate Costan Rican President Oscar Arias for the important role he played in fashioning the San Jose
process, and the OAS for its role in facilitating this successful round of talks.
-- I cannot think of another example of a country that, having suffered a rupture of its democratic and constitutional
order, overcome such a crisis through negotiation and dialogue. This is an a big step forward for the inter-American
system and its commitment to democracy as embodied in the Inter-american Democratic Charter.
-- we were proud to be part of this process, and commit ourselves to working with Honduras as it prepares for elections.

SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED
Tegucigalpa/San Jose Accord: Both delegations reached agreement this morning on the text of the preamble to the
"Tegucigalpa/San Jose Accord." They also reached agreement on Article 8 (Final Dispositions), the calendar of
implementation of the Accord (Article 9), as well a final declaration (Article 10). Both delegations also prepared a new
Article (11) giving thanks and special mention for their support to the U.S. (President Obama and Secretary Clinton), the
OAS and President Arias. Both delegations signed the Tegucigalpa/San Jose Accord about mid-day today. As per its
terms, the Accord is effective the moment it is signed. Both delegations also submitted a copy of the Accord to the
National Congress about 2 PM this afternoon. The two sides plan to continue working this weekend with support from
OAS staff re selecting the four member (2 Honduran and 2 international) Verification Commission. Both delegations
expressed a strong preference for nominating Colin Powell (improbable due to his heavy travel schedule). Other names
being considered include President Lagos of Chile, Sanguinetti of Uruguay, Governor Bill Richardson and Senator Mel
Martinez. The Accord calls for the Verification Commission to be created by November 2. We understand that OAS
Secretary General Insulza plans to arrive in Tegucigalpa on Sunday, November 1. The OAS is helping to organize a public
ceremony commemorating the Accord on the morning of November 2. Both sides and the OAS plan to invite regional
heads of state and foreign ministers. We expect President Arias and other Central American heads of state to attend the
ceremony. We've heard that Z and M are already in contact, through intermediaries, with the objective of creating a
government of national unity. Under the terms of the Accord, the new government must be formed between the
signing of the Accord (today) and NLT November 5.
While the current calendar of implementation appears to be going well, we expect Congressional approval of Article 6 to
be complicated. While the presidential candidates support the Accord, there is concern within the parties about the
timing of its implementation, particularly on the eve of the election. We will continue to reach out to political leaders
and all sides and encourage them to support the expeditious implementation of the Accord.

Diplomatic Front: We've heard that the regime Foreign Ministry is inviting Ambassadors back into the country. The
Swedish Ambassador, who is resident in Guatemala, is here on a visit and plans to attend the Accord ceremony on
November 2. We are also expecting the Spanish Ambassador, Ignacio Ruperez, to arrive this weekend. OAS PODIR
Victor Rico told us that he plans to return to DC tomorrow, but will come back later next week.
Elections: The Swedish Ambassador told me she will be meeting with the Supreme Electoral Tribunal and discuss the
renewed Swedish elections assistance. We also understand that the Japanese are planning to move forward with
support for the elections process. Finally, the UN pulled back plans to withdraw its elections technical assistance
team. Most eyes, however, are on the OAS and specifically what the Permanent Council will do about sending an
elections observer mission.

Afghan official: Eight linked to UN attack arrested
KABUL (AP) - Authorities have arrested eight people, including one in Saudi Arabia, in
connection with this week's deadly attack on a guest house used by United Nations
employees, the Afghan intelligence chief said. He said those arrested claimed the
assailants came from Pakistan's Swat Valley.
Afghan official: We had advance intel on UN attack
KABUL (AP) - Afghan intelligence had advance information that a Taliban attack was in
the works in Kabul before a deadly assault on a U.N. guest house and ramped up
security, but not during the pre-dawn hours when the militants struck, a top official said

Rashad Hussain, a Muslim and new U.S. envoy, is bridge between two
worlds
By Scott Wilson
Monday, March 1, 2010; A19
Rashad Hussain, President Obama's new special envoy to the Organization of the Islamic Conference, was an
avid high school debater in Plano, Tex., where he grew up.
His debate partner and best friend was a classmate named Josh Goldberg, meaning that at the end of many
tournaments, the judge would announce "Goldberg-Hussain" as the cultural odd couple who had won the
argument. "People got a kick out of it," Hussain said in a recent interview. "We joked that one day we would
have the solution to the peace process." The two remain close friends.
In his new position, Hussain, who is both a Koran scholar and an ardent North Carolina Tar Heels basketball
fan, will be responsible for helping to bridge another cultural divide -- the one in U.S. relations with Muslims
inside and outside the nation's borders.
Since taking office, Obama has adopted an approach to broaden the ways in which the United States engages
the Islamic world, moving from a policy focused mostly on counterterrorism to one that includes partnerships
with Muslim countries and communities in education, health, science and commerce.
Hussain, 31, will be the face of that policy in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, where the Islamic Conference has it
headquarters, and in the other capitals of its 56 member countries. His is an appropriately young face for an
American representative to the world's 1.6 billion Muslims, the majority of whom are younger than he is.
At a time when the United States is fighting two wars in Muslim nations and defending itself against an
enduring terrorist threat, changing perceptions will take time. "The challenge is to continue to communicate that
this is a long-term process," Hussain said. "Sometimes the challenge becomes that people want to focus
exclusively on the political issues, issues that this administration is working very diligently to solve."
Hussain's father, a mining engineer, moved from Bihar, India, to Wyoming in the late 1960s. A few years later,
during a visit to India, he married Hussain's mother, now an obstetrician in Plano.

The family prayed regularly in a mosque not far from the church-heavy city. At about the time he began middle
school, the Persian Gulf War began and, as he recalled, "it was not the easiest time to be named Hussain." But
he said he encountered very little religious persecution during a childhood that featured study, prayer and
basketball -- a passion he shares with the president. Hussain said it is his "dream" to play in one of Obama's
pickup games.
He graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, then enrolled at Harvard University to
pursue a master's degree in Arabic and Islamic studies. An internship after his first year of graduate school with
Rep. Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) cemented his interest in government, and he returned after completing his
degree to work on the House Judiciary Committee and was there on the morning of the attacks of Sept. 11,
2001.
"I experienced firsthand being evacuated from the building, not knowing what was going on, seeing the twin
towers burning on TV as soon as I got into work, not knowing . . . whether there was a plane heading for the
Capitol," he said. "I very much experienced the terror on that day myself."
In the following days, he said, he experienced a "whole set of feelings," from the initial fear of attack to worry
about discrimination against American Muslims. He said he found that compassion, broader than the pockets of
persecution, is often overlooked by Muslims here and abroad.
"A lot is made about American misperceptions about Muslim communities, but there's a lot of misperceptions
that Muslim communities have about the United States," he said. To counter such misunderstandings of Muslim
culture, Hussain cited his wife, whom he said "breaks down a lot of the misperceptions of women in Islam." Isra
Bhatty, a Yale Law School student currently on a Rhodes scholarship, wears the hijab and is an epic Chicago
Bears fan.
Hussain left Capitol Hill to attend Yale Law School. While there, he criticized the trial of Sami al-Arian, a
University of South Florida professor, as "politically motivated persecution." Arian was accused of aiding the
Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization. Hussain, who did not criticize the
charges against Arian, was on a civil liberties panel with Arian's daughter when he made the comment. A jury
acquitted Arian on some charges and deadlocked on others; he eventually pleaded guilty to one count of
conspiracy.
"My extensive writings on this topic make it clear that I condemn terrorism unequivocally in all its forms,"
Hussain said. "I'd be happy to put that against one sentence from 2004 that I believe was taken out of context."
After the 2008 election, Hussain was recruited to the White House counsel's office by Cassandra Butts, a fellow
Tar Heel and Obama's former Harvard Law classmate. He has worked there on national security and new-media
issues and helped inform the administration's Muslim outreach efforts.
Ben Rhodes, Obama's chief foreign policy speechwriter, sought Hussain's counsel last year as he drafted the
president's Cairo address. Hussain said his advice concerned the contributions Muslims have made to American
society and the context behind some of the religious passages. Hussain has memorized the Koran. He prays
daily, often in a room in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building reserved for all faiths.
Hussain traveled in the Middle East after Obama announced his appointment during a Feb. 13 videoconference
at the U.S.-Islamic World Forum in Doha, Qatar. His approach, Hussain said, will be to emphasize to Muslim
countries what "America stands for," including through the partnerships.
"It's clear that we're not going to agree on every single issue," Hussain said. "Our job will be to try to maximize
our areas of agreement and work through our areas of disagreement and come to the best policy."

SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, Senator Casey, I can't thank you enough for asking that question, because I
think you are 100 percent right. I obviously believe that what we're doing is part of our security. And I think
that case is certainly more understandable for people today, since 9/11, than it might have been beforehand. But
I also think it is essential to our economy.
You illustrate one example of that, the Export-Import Bank. We really believe that we can do even more
through the EXIM Bank, and I'm going to try to encourage that approach. Somebody asked me what I'd like to
do; I said I'd like to put EXIM Bank on steroids because I think it does so much good work for American
companies, and I want American businesses to know that.

FYI. In light of upcoming S-call. This just out.
JERUSALEM - (AP) Israel's prime minister says he won't pull out of a key part of the West Bank even if there's a peace
agreement with the Palestinians.
Benjamin Netanyahu was referring to the Jordan River Valley along the eastern border of the West Bank. Palestinians
claim all of the West Bank as part of their future state.
Netanyahu's pronouncement comes as the U.S. is pushing hard to restart peace talks. Palestinians hesitate to
negotiate because of Netanyahu's hardline attitudes and Israeli settlement construction.
Netanyahu told a parliamentary committee Tuesday that the Jordan Valley's strategic importance makes it impossible
for Israel to withdraw, according to a meeting participant who spoke on condition of anonymity because the meeting
was closed.

A quick summary from Ibrahim; these comments were made prior to the FoLLow-Op Cty meeting,
which is now underway. -rw
In press statements this evening, NAR stressed that the PA and the PLO are committed to the
Arab position which will be developed in the meeting of the Arab Follow Up committee in
Cairo. In response to a question at the beginning of the meeting on President Abbas's
presentation to the committee, NAR said that the ideas that will be presented are not those
of President Abu Mazen but basically are about the US responses to the Palestinian questions
in relation to the role of Senator Mitchell in the 'proximity talks. He will also stress
that the Palestinian position will be the same as the Arab position.
He added that these ideas will be presented to the to the Arab Follow Up committee and we
shall see what the Arabs will say. And we will adhere to the Arab position completely
exactly as we did when we went to Annapolis and to Madrid peace conference. He said the
answer will be provided in the meeting. He went on to say that we have received some
responses from Washington to questions which President Abbas had raised. In response to a
question on whether the US answers constitute an appropriate ground to resume negotiations,
NAR said that the US wants to move the peace process forward and want to create a conducive
atmosphere to launch direct negotiations in the future. He said that the proposed proximity
talks essentially are based on Senator Mitchell continuing his trips between the Palestinians
and Israelis. As far as we are concerned, we shall abide by the Arab position. He also said

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767865 Date: 08/31/2015
we will not develop any position with respect to negotiations without Arab consensus whether
in terms of accepting or rejecting the US ideas.
With regards to resumption of direct negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis, NAR
said that there are no proposals (ideas) at present time to resume direct negotiations. He
said that the Arab and Palestinian position on this issue is clear; there needs to be a clear
TOR for negotiations and total cessation of settlement activities. He said that the PA
position in principle is not against negotiations. On the contrary its for negotiations that
do not waste time since the Palestinian national interest requires a solution as soon as
possible to create the independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as capital. NAR went on
to say that, before talking about resumption of direct negotiations, there is a need to
clarify the basis of these negotiations and to know the fate of settlements and to what
extent will Israeli abide by freezing settlement activities.
With respect to Israeli provocations which seriously tamper with security and stability, NAR
said that Israel does not want a return to negotiations but wants to blame the Palestinians
by saying they don't want to enter negotiations. NAR went on to say 'It is imperative to take
away this pretext by exposing the real Israeli position to the international community and
the US administration. He said we are ready to resume negotiations on clear basis but its
the Israeli side that places obstacles to avert meeting its commitments while blaming the
Palestinian side (as Israel is accustomed to doing).

that the entire trip was postponed, not the PNG portion. As you can imagine that is politically very significant.
Naturally, we stand ready to reconstitute the program or enhance it should the trip move forward at a later date. We
got luck today w/the weather—not a rain cloud in sight.
Safe travels, and hopefully we will work together at a later date. Best of luck with the Haiti recovery effort!

Thanks for taking my call and it is nice to reconnect with you.
As discussed, I wanted to officially notify you, as a matter of courtesy, that former Secretary Rice will be

business/commercial purposes.
In Hong Kong, she will be speaking at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In Sanya, she will be speaking at
the Boao International Tourism Forum. In Beijing, she will call upon current Chinese officials with whom she
worked during her time in office. The Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs (CPIFA) are serving as her
hosts in Sanya and Beijing.
We are not requesting any assistance or support from the US Mission in China. However, if you could let Post
(Front Office / RSOs / Consulates) know of her travel plans we would be very appreciative.
Also, if it is not too much trouble I would like to establish personal contact with the RSOs just as a
contingency. I will be the POC for this trip, so feel free to pass my contact information on to the appropriate
individuals in the event they have further questions, etc.
While in country she will be staying at:

I got the readout from the Secretary's call to Indian FM Krishna, and I understand that she will convey India's

Right after the call, the MEA sought to clarify a key point, which moderates Krishna's message. According to
the GOI, the Ministry wants to underline that while the Minister had conveyed to the Secretary India's "broad
political support" for the Copenhagen Accord, it was not yet ready to be "listed" as a party to the Accord. But
the GOI also understands that the listing process is a priority matter.

Possibility of Senate Run, Nurtured and Abandoned By MICHAEL BARBARO March 03, 2010 New York Times
A few weeks ago, Harold E. Ford Jr. had a telephone conversation with his friend Doug Band, the powerful counselor to
former President Bill Clinton.
Mr. Ford, the former Tennessee congressman who now works on Wall Street, wanted to discuss a potential challenge to
Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand in New York's Democratic primary, a possibility he had flirted with for weeks.
But Mr. Band was not encouraging. He told Mr. Ford that with Democrats reeling from political setbacks across the
country, it would be bad for the party and his career if he entered the race. "It's not the right thing to do," he said,
according to a person with direct knowledge of the conversation.
A Ford spokesman confirmed the call but denied that Mr. Ford had been discouraged from running or that he had been
told that doing so would hurt the party. The spokesman said Mr. Band told him the White House had pressured Mr.
Clinton into supporting Ms. Gillibrand.
Mr. Ford's decision not to run for the Senate, which he disclosed on Tuesday, came after he reached out to dozens of
donors, advocates and political leaders. In private conversations, the same worries emerged: that a race against Ms.
Gillibrand would be a brutal fight, dominated by endless debates about when he began paying taxes as a New York
resident and the sincerity of his support for gay marriage and abortion rights.
A campaign that he had hoped would focus on tax cuts and job growth would instead, he feared, become mired in
discussions of "who got there first, and who meant it the most," on social issues, he told an associate. That might allow a
Republican opponent to swoop in and take the seat from the bloodied Democratic nominee.
What seemed to weigh on him, interviews with dozens of people who have met and spoken to his advisers revealed,
was not his status as a carpetbagger who had moved to New York from Tennessee, but rather the reality that there were
few easy constituencies for him to grab on to, outside of Wall Street, where he has worked since moving here in 2006.
Many spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be seen as disclosing private conversations.
As he hopscotched from city to city, charming crowds with bits of his Southern biography, signs of trouble for Mr. Ford
emerged. His voting record in Congress put him on the right fringes of state Democrats, and his $2 million-a-year job at
Merrill Lynch made it hard to run as a Scott Brown-style populist.
What seemed like an improbable, even impossible campaign had its roots in conversations, many dating back a year,
among Mr. Ford, 39, and a coterie of powerful friends from New York City, Washington and Los Angeles.
Over dinner last July at the Post House, a clubby steakhouse on the Upper East Side, Richard Plepler, a co-president of
HBO, urged Mr. Ford to restart his political career in New York. "I think you should give this serious thought," he said, of
the Senate race. Mr. Ford replied that he would.
After the dinner, Mr. Plepler sent an e-mail message to Douglas E. Schoen, a top Democratic pollster, to bounce the idea
off him. Mr. Schoen was intrigued, and as he studied public polls, became convinced that Mr. Ford's best shot at
reaching the Senate was to wage a campaign against Ms. Gillibrand.

Over the next few months, Mr. Ford sounded out many of New York's wealthiest and most politically connected
executives, frequently over breakfast at the Regency Hotel on Park Avenue: Robert Wolf, the head of the United States
investment banking division at UBS; Ronald Perelman, the billionaire chairman of Revlon; and Steven Rattner, the
founder of Quadrangle, the private equity firm, all of whom are big Democratic donors.
Mr. Rattner told Mr. Ford, who is also a political analyst on NBC, that money would not be a problem. "You can raise the
money," he told him in December.
Yet several big-name donors warned him that Ms. Gillibrand, a relentless campaigner, had beaten him to the punch.
"She has already locked a lot of Wall Street up" was the message that Marc Lasry, a billionaire hedge fund manager,
conveyed to Mr. Ford in a telephone conversation.
As Mr. Ford traveled outside New York City, especially upstate, he found political support for Ms. Gillibrand to be
shallow, and the hunger for change palpable. The mayor of Syracuse, Stephanie Miner, told him that residents there
were "scared and desperate" about the economy, and she told Mr. Ford that Ms. Gillibrand was a rare presence in her
city.
But Ms. Gillibrand's strategy of portraying Mr. Ford as a showboating out-of-towner was starting to stick. In late January,
the head of the Brooklyn Democratic Party, Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, held a luncheon for Mr. Ford, and invited local
lawmakers. During a two-hour question-and-answer session, Marty Markowitz, the borough president, pointed to
several up-and-coming state senators around the room and observed that all of them had greater experience in New
York politics than Mr. Ford.
"With all due respect," he asked Mr. Ford, "why do you think you have what it takes to be New York's senator?"
Even lawmakers who seemed open to a Ford candidacy warned him that peeling away support from Ms. Gillibrand
would be harder than it seemed.
Ruben Diaz Jr., the Bronx borough president, told Mr. Ford between bites of an omelet at a diner near his office, "It's
difficult to make a strong case against her here." Ms. Gillibrand, he explained, had just secured $4 million worth of
federal stimulus money to train his constituents for green jobs. Mr. Ford knew that some liberals would attack his
relatively conservative voting record but, those he spoke with said, he was taken aback by the depth of the anger he
encountered from advocates for abortion rights and gay marriage.
After reporters found examples of Mr. Ford calling himself pro-life during his time in Congress, Mr. Ford vehemently
pushed back, saying he had always supported a woman's right to choose. He assumed that would put the matter to rest.
It did not. "He was dumbfounded that it kept tripping him up," a friend said.
One of Mr. Ford's top advisers, Bradley Tusk, the campaign manager for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's 2009 re-election,
arranged a meeting for Mr. Ford with a close Bloomberg ally, Kelli Conlin, the head of Naral-Pro Choice of New York. Mr.
Ford expected a polite conversation that would help neutralize a foe. Ms. Conlin, however, started the meeting by
quizzing Mr. Ford on his voting record and public statements.
Did he realize, she asked, that he had backed legislation that would outlaw late-term abortions even when a woman's
health is in danger?
Far from conciliatory, Mr. Ford wanted to know why Naral allowed Ms. Gillibrand to vote for a health care bill that cut
off financing for abortions. "You gave her a pass," he said. Before leaving, Mr. Ford told Ms. Conlin that if he chose to
run he hoped to return to ask for the group's support. Ms. Conlin responded: "We can never support you if you take
these positions." Mr. Ford "looked shocked," a person in the room said.

His meeting with gay rights advocates on Feb. 24 was rockier still. When he walked into the headquarters of the
Stonewall Democrats in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, he was greeted by signs that read "Liar!" and "Go
home snake oil Harry," a reference to his recent support for gay marriage after having twice voted to outlaw it in
Congress.
A few days later, the results of a poll that Mr. Ford had paid for out of his own pocket began to trickle in, giving his
advisers pause. His negative ratings had increased slightly. A liberal primary electorate seemed wary about portions of
his record. Ms. Gillibrand remained vulnerable, the data showed, but Mr. Ford's chance seemed to be 50-50. "It was not
a slam dunk, at all," said a person who spoke with him and was briefed on the data.
Mr. Tusk had told associates that to win, Mr. Ford needed 80 percent of the state's black vote, a tall order, but not
inconceivable for an African-American in a Democratic primary. But by the end of the week, Gov. David A. Paterson and
Representative Charles B. Rangel had become embroiled in ethics scandals. New York's black political elite was in
seeming disarray, just when he needed them to be organized and unified.
By Sunday, he had made up his mind not to run. He told his wife, Emily, and his father, former Representative Harold
Ford Sr. He began to call friends the next evening, leaving many of them brief messages.
"I'm not going to run this time," he said in one message. "Thank you for your support."

STATEMENT OF SECRETARY CLINTON
The Passing of Victoria DeLong
This morning I spoke with the family of Victoria DeLong, the Cultural Affairs Officer at our Embassy in Port-Au-Prince
who lost her life in the earthquake. I expressed my sincerest condolences on behalf of the men and women of the State
Department and the American people. This is one tragedy among so many. The United Nations has suffered grevious
losses. And the Hatian people have endured unimaginable heartbreak. For the State Department, we have lost one of
our own. Victoria was a veteran Foreign Service Officer who worked tirelessly to build bridges of understanding and
respect between the people of the United State and the people of Haiti. She served her country with distinction and
honor, and she will be sorely missed. Victoria's friends and colleagues at the Embassy are working day and night to
support vital relief and recovery efforts, and our thoughts, our prayers, and our deepest thanks are with them as well.
Along with the military personnel, the search and rescue teams, and all the aid and relief workers now deploying, they
represent the unwavering commitment of the United States to stand with Haiti in its hour of need and in the hard days
and years to come. My heart is with the DeLong family today, and with all those in Haiti and around the world who have
lost loved ones and friends in this disaster.

Why Haiti Matters
In the tragic aftermath of Haiti's 7.0 earthquake, images of the disaster break our hearts and remind us of the fragility of
life. What America must do now—and why.
By Barack Obama I NEWSWEEK
Published Jan 15, 2010
From the magazine issue dated Jan 25, 2010
In the last week, we have been deeply moved by the heartbreaking images of the devastation in Haiti: parents searching
through rubble for sons and daughters; children, frightened and alone, looking for their mothers and fathers. At this
moment, entire parts of Port-au-Prince are in ruins, as families seek shelter in makeshift camps. It is a horrific scene of
shattered lives in a poor nation that has already suffered so much.
In response, I have ordered a swift, coordinated, and aggressive effort to save lives in Haiti. We have launched one of
the largest relief efforts in recent history. I have instructed the leaders of all agencies to make our response a top
priority across the federal government. We are mobilizing every element of our national capacity: the resources of
development agencies, the strength of our armed forces, and most important, the compassion of the American people.
And we are working closely with the Haitian government, the United Nations, and the many international partners who
are also aiding in this extraordinary effort.
We act for the sake of the thousands of American citizens who are in Haiti, and for their families back home; for the sake
of the Haitian people who have been stricken with a tragic history, even as they have shown great resilience; and we act
because of the close ties that we have with a neighbor that is only a few hundred miles to the south.
But above all, we act for a very simple reason: in times of tragedy, the United States of America steps forward and helps.
That is who we are. That is what we do. For decades, America's leadership has been founded in part on the fact that we
do not use our power to subjugate others, we use it to lift them up—whether it was rebuilding our former adversaries
after World War II, dropping food and water to the people of Berlin, or helping the people of Bosnia and Kosovo rebuild
their lives and their nations.
At no time is that more true than in moments of great peril and human suffering. It is why we have acted to help people
combat the scourge of HIV/AIDS in Africa, or to recover from a catastrophic tsunami in Asia. When we show not just our
power, but also our compassion, the world looks to us with a mixture of awe and admiration. That advances our
leadership. That shows the character of our country. And it is why every American can look at this relief effort with the
pride of knowing that America is acting on behalf of our common humanity.

Right now, our search-and-rescue teams are on the ground, pulling people from the rubble. Americans from Virginia and
California and Florida have worked round the clock to save people whom they've never met. Our soldiers, sailors,
airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen quickly deployed to the scene. Hand in hand with our civilians, they're laboring
day and night to facilitate a massive logistical enterprise; to deliver and distribute food, water, and medicine to save
lives; and to prevent an even larger humanitarian catastrophe.
Greater help is on the way. This will be a complex and difficult rescue and recovery operation, and it takes time to move
all of the resources necessary into such a devastated environment. But more American rescue teams, doctors, nurses,
and paramedics will arrive to care for the injured. More water, food, and supplies will be delivered. An aircraft carrier
has arrived. A naval hospital ship has been deployed. And additional aircraft and heavy equipment will restore
communications and clear roads and ports to speed relief and hasten recovery.
In addition, in this new century no great challenge will be one we can solve alone. In this humanitarian effort, we'll work
closely with other nations, so that our work on the ground is efficient and effective even under what are very difficult
conditions. We'll also join with the United Nations, which has done so much to bring security and stability to Haiti over
the years, and which has suffered terrible losses in this tragedy. And we'll partner with the constellation of
nongovernmental organizations that have a long and established record of working to improve the lives of the Haitian
people.
It is also important to note that all of these efforts will be bolstered by the continuing good will and generosity of
ordinary citizens. Governments alone are not enough. Already, a record number of donations have come in through text
messaging. Money has poured into the Red Cross and other relief organizations. I want to thank the many Americans
who have already contributed to this effort. And I want to encourage all Americans who want to help to go to
whitehouse.gov to learn more.
And, lastly, in the days, months, and years ahead, we'll need to work closely with the government and people of Haiti to
reclaim the momentum that they achieved before the earthquake. It is particularly devastating that this crisis has come
at a time when—at long last, after decades of conflict and instability—Haiti was showing hopeful signs of political and
economic progress. In the months and years to come, as the tremors fade and Haiti no longer tops the headlines or
leads the evening news, our mission will be to help the people of Haiti to continue on their path to a brighter future. The
United States will be there with the Haitian government and the United Nations every step of the way.
In the aftermath of disaster, we are reminded that life can be unimaginably cruel. That pain and loss is so often meted
out without any justice or mercy. That "time and chance" happen to us all. But it is also in these moments, when we are
brought face to face with our own fragility, that we rediscover our common humanity. We look into the eyes of another
and see ourselves. And so the United States of America will lead the world in this humanitarian endeavor. That has been
our history, and that is how we will answer the challenge before us.

Dear Hillary and all.
We arrived at the general hospital last night with 1500 people sick or dying with 40 percent needing surgery. It has no
water electricity or food and very limited surgical suites or supplies It the largest and most well known public hospital in
the city and according to PIH and paul farmer needs to be supported and it's infrastucture needs to be rebuilt.
Right now we have surgeons but not enough operating rooms set up. We
desperately need to get a generator and fuel and surgical lights and surgery supplies not just first aid. There are
hundreds including children with festering wounds needing amputation and emergency
surgical care. The doctors nurses and patients have no food or water.
Can you help get the infrastructure of electricity water and a medical hospital tent for post op patients. We are
operating with headlamps and hacksaws rinsed with alcohol.
If we have the electricity and water we can open 11 operating rooms tomorrow if we get what we need. Can the
military help ASAP and for security of equipment and medication.
Until this morning when id the first amuptation there was almost no surgery happening at all here in the city and
none at the General.
Five days after the quake with no acute surgical care wounds are
festering patients are getting septic and dying. If we had a little
help with basic servcices we could stop this.
I don't have cell or email at the hospital. Please coordinate with Claire Pierre or Nancy from. PIH.
Thank you thank you thank you.

BAKU (Reuters) - Turkey ally Azerbaijan condemned a U.S. House panel resolution on the 1915 killing of Armenians as
a blow to regional stability and to efforts to resolve a conflict over Armenian-backed Nagorno-Karabakh. The Azeri
parliament unanimously adopted a strongly-worded statement saying the resolution, which labeled the mass killings by
Ottoman Turks as genocide, "damages efforts to restore peace and stability in the region."

the dead body of Minister Moldomusa Kongatiyev in a government building in the western town of Talas. Murat said
the protesters in Talas who seized a police headquarters on the second day of anti-government rallies beat up
Kongatiyev and forced him to order his subordinates in the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek to stop a crackdown on an
opposition rally there. Police in Bishkek opened fire earlier April 7 on the protesters and an opposition leader said at
least 17 were killed. Protesters in Bishkek also stormed the building of the state-owned television company.

Statement by the Secretary
The Death of Polish President Kaczynski and His Delegation
I join President Obama in offering my deepest condolences to the people of Poland, to the Kaczynski family, and to the
families of all those killed in this tragedy. Lost alongside President Kaczynski and his wife were Polish leaders from
across the political spectrum, men and women who shaped and sped Poland's post-1989 democratic transformation and
were leading Poland into its promising future. The tragedy of these lives cut short will be felt deeply across the world,
but their legacy will live on in a free and flourishing Poland.
The United States stands with the Polish people in this difficult hour. Like the country he led, President Kaczynski was
one of America's most valued and trusted allies. He was well known in the United States as a champion for democracy
against an oppressive regime, a man whose journey took him from the Gdatisk Shipyards to the presidency of a free
people. President Kaczynski was an unstinting advocate for freedom and human rights not just in Poland, but around
the world. He will be long remembered and sorely missed.
The Polish people have endured more than their share of sorrow, but they have always shown resilience and resolve in

Statement by the Secretary
The Death of Polish President Kaczynski and His Delegation
I join President Obama in offering my deepest condolences to the people of Poland, to the Kaczynski family, and to the
families of all those killed in this tragedy. Lost alongside President Kaczynski and his wife were Polish leaders from
across the political spectrum, men and women who shaped and sped Poland's post-1989 democratic transformation and
were leading Poland into its promising future. The tragedy of these lives cut short will be felt deeply across the world,
but their legacy will live on in a free and flourishing Poland.
The United States stands with the Polish people in this difficult hour. Like the country he led, President Kaczynski was
one of America's most valued and trusted allies. He was well known in the United States as a champion for democracy
against an oppressive regime, a man whose journey took him from the Gdarisk Shipyards to the presidency of a free
people. President Kaczynski was an unstinting advocate for freedom and human rights not just in Poland, but around
the world. He will be long remembered and sorely missed.
The Polish people have endured more than their share of sorrow, but they have always shown resilience and resolve in
the face of adversity -- and I know they will pull together in solidarity to grieve this loss.
My thoughts and prayers are with all the people of Poland today.

BISHKEK - (AP) The head of Kyrgyzstan's interim government, Roza Otunbayeva, said the deposed president must face
trial, rescinding an earlier offer of security guarantees for him. Otunbayeva and others had earlier offered ousted
President Bakiyev a safe passage out of the country if he resigned voluntarily. Bakiyev, speaking to Russian media from
his home Jalal-Abad region in southern Kyrgyzstan, urged the United Nations to send peacekeepers to Kyrgyzstan to
prevent unrest from spreading.

BELFAST - (AP) Northern Ireland's Catholic and Protestant lawmakers have appointed their first justice minister, a
power-sharing landmark that IRA dissidents protested by bombing the local base of Britain's .
spy agency MI5. David Ford
received support in the Northern Ireland Assembly from both the Protestants of the Democratic Unionists and the
Catholics of Sinn Fein, who jointly lead the province's three-year-old administration. The Democratic Unionists and Sinn
Fein spent years negotiating terms for receiving control of Northern Ireland's justice system from Britain. Their
compromise candidate, Ford, leads a small party called Alliance that seeks votes equally from both sides of the
community. Ford denounced Monday's bombing, in which no one was injured, as pointless.

BELFAST (Reuters) - A car bomb planted outside a Northern Ireland police station by dissident republicans was defused,
police said, a day after a bomb exploded near the headquarters of the British intelligence services. In a call to local
media, the Continuity IRA, which last year killed a police officer in the bloodiest three days in Northern Ireland for more
than a decade, claimed responsibility for planting the bomb in the county of Armagh.

Joint Statement by Former President Clinton and Secretary of State Clinton on the Passing of Dr. Dorothy Height We are
deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Dr. Dorothy Height, an icon of America's long march toward equality and a
personal inspiration to us both. As the only woman among the "Big Six" civil rights leaders, Dr. Height helped galvanize a
movement that changed our country forever. She organized the "Wednesdays in Mississippi" meetings that brought
black and white women together to find common ground and break down barriers. She never stopped fighting for what
she knew was right. And through it all, she was always the best dressed woman in the room. We were blessed to know
Dr. Height, to benefit from her grace, passion and wisdom, and to call her our friend. For decades, starting with the early
days at the Children's Defense Fund, we worked with her, learned from her, and drew inspiration from her example.
From the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to the Congressional Gold Medal, to the unveiling of a long-sought-after bust
of Sojourner Truth in the United States Capitol, we had the privilege of helping honor Dr. Height and her
accomplishments. Born before women had the right to vote, denied access to the college of her choice because of the
color of her skin, and witness to nation divided, Dr. Height dedicated her life to the proposition that all Americans should
have the opportunity to live up to their full God-given potential. Our nation is poorer for her loss but infinitely richer for
the life she led, the progress she achieved, and the people she touched. Our thoughts and prayers are with Dr. Height's
family today, and with her many loving friends and colleagues. She would be the first to tell us that the best way to
honor her memory is to carry forward the work she started and the causes she championed, to open wide the freedom
gates. May we all find the strength and the wisdom to live up to her legacy.

YEREVAN (Reuters) — Armenia's ruling coalition said it had decided to freeze the ratification in parliament of accords
with Turkey aimed at normalizing ties between the historic foes.
"Considering the Turkish side's refusal to fulfill the requirement to ratify the accord without preconditions in a reasonable
time, making the continuation of the ratification process in the national parliament pointless, we consider it necessary to
suspend this process," the statement said.

CAIRO (AP) - Arab nations have given the Palestinians the green light to enter indirect peace talks with Israel for a
preliminary four-month period. The decision from Arab foreign ministers likely opens the way for the start of long-
stalled US-brokered negotiations. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas signaled this week that he would be willing to
resume negotiations. Secretary Clinton said April 30 the talks would start next week.

Subject: (Reuters) Iraqi panel invalidates votes for 52 candidates
BAGHDAD (Reuters) - An Iraqi review panel invalidated the votes of 52 candidates of the March election, officials said,
possibly wiping out the slim lead of a Sunni-backed alliance. It was not immediately clear how many of the candidates
barred for alleged ties to Saddam Hussein's banned Baath party had won seats in the March 7 ballot. If the result
changed, the decision could spark anger among Sunnis just as the sectarian violence unleashed after the 2003 U.S.-led
invasion recedes. The panel's ruling was confirmed by Ali al-Lami, a senior member of a commission that sought to bar
candidates with Baath party links, Tariq Harp, a lawyer for Prime Minister Nuni al-Maliki's State of Law coalition, and
Mustafa al-Hiti, a senior member of the winning lraqiya alliance that was heavily backed by Sunnis.

CG Shanghai provided the update below on Chinese President Hu's visit to the U.S. pavilion at the Shanghai Expo. For
your situational awareness:
SWO Chinese President Hu Jintao visited the USA Pavilion at the Shanghai Expo around 12:30 p.m. for 15-20 minutes
Thursday, April 29 (Shanghai time). USA Pavilion Commissioner General Jose Villarreal and Consul General Beatrice
Camp greeted President Hu, who was accompanied by Vice Premier Wang Qishan, Shanghai Expo Bureau officials, and a
large contingent of Chinese media. Hu then walked through the pavilion's initial section (the "Overture") where Vice
Premier Wang Qishan called attention to all the logos of the pavilion's sponsors. The Chinese president also viewed a
film clip of President Obama welcoming visitors to the pavilion and shook hands with about 10 of the nearly 80 U.S.
"student ambassadors" staffing the pavilion. Before departing, President Hu thanked Commissioner General Villarreal
and wished the USA Pavilion great success.

BEIJING, April 29 (Reuters) - A knife-wielding man injured 28 children, two teachers and a security guard in a
kindergarten in eastern China, state media reported on Thursday, the fourth such stabbing case in recent weeks. Xu
Yuyuan, 47, an unemployed local man, broke into a classroom in Taixing city of eastern Jiangsu province on Thursday
morning, attacking the children with a 20 cm long knife, the official Xinhua news agency said. The injured children were
all about four years old, and five are in critical condition, it added. Xu has been jobless since he was fired from a local
insurance company in 2001, and then took part in pyramid selling schemes, Xinhua added. The attack is the fourth
reported school stabbing in China in recent weeks, and the rash of violence has prompted public calls for more measures
to protect students in a country where many couples only have one child. A man stabbed 16 students and a teacher at a
primary school in southern China on Wednesday, the same day that a former doctor was executed for stabbing to death
eight school children last month. "More concrete measures should be taken to make school the safest place," a
commentary in today's Beijing News said, calling for more serve punishment for these killers. Some Chinese people have
taken to the Internet to discuss the root causes of the increasing number of school tragedies

Hi,Huma,
Please share this with Hillary.

Dear Hillary,
I am hoping we can pick up the threads of our previous conversations, including meeting again with Cheryl. I continue to
believe that I can - and would very much like to - be able to contribute meaningfully to your work and the mission of the
Department. Issues having to do with the status of children world-wide, health liaison to US AID and a variety of issues
within the realm of disaster response and preparedness.
- I just today participated in and spoke at a major conference in DC on nuclear terrorism. Most of the speakers and
participants were federal officials, including WH staff. One of the key points I made was the extraordinary disconnect
between administration concerns with respect to the possibility of IND/nuclear terrorism and the degree to which this is
essentially ignored in state and local disaster planning, including in the principal target cities. My discussions with
officials in Great Britain and a couple of other countries reveal a similar inability to deal with nuclear preparedness. For
many of these folks, here and abroad, images of apocalyptic destruction - as was the actual threat during the nuclear
arms race with the Soviets - are just paralyzing.
However, a terrorist IND, is not an all-out nuclear war. Current, scientific modeling suggests that minimal planning for
an IND could save hundreds of thousands of lives and create a much high level of resiliency than we currently have
I believe that an international consortium of disaster response and recovery planning officials should be considered as a
means of increasing attention and resources focused on nuclear - and CBRNE in general - terrorism readiness. We have
much that could be learned from one another in terms of advancing this work. My center at Columbia recently held a
very successful and productive conference called "Day 3"
, focused on the regional conditions and projections 72 hours post IND detonation.
- Natural disasters also remain a major challenge and potentially increasingly so over the years to come. I feel that
there is much to be gained by upgrading the level and quality of our international collaboration around disaster
response planning - and particularly major disaster recovery, still one of the great unsolved challenges world-wide.

- As a member of the federally appointed National Commission on Children and Disasters, we just completed a field
hearing of state and federal officials on the management of children brought from Haiti to Florida for medical care and
humanitarian rescue. Some were American nationals, others not. But the reports from people involved in the process
were overwhelmingly concerned about lack of coordination, dangerously inadequate information accompanying many
of the kids who came over and lots of less than positive feedback about operations within Haiti. I believe that I could
help in the organization of emergency response, overseeing some of the key functions in managing international
disasters which end up involving the U.S.
- I had a chance and very interesting meeting with Ban Ki-Moon 2 weeks ago. I mentioned an idea I have been thinking
about having to do with another world children's summit. The last one was in 1990, held at the U.N. and involving
about 150 countries, including heads of state from about 45 - 50 nations. Conditions for children were outlined and
goals set for future improvements - many of which were met, many not.. We are overdue for another world gathering
focused on children. This would obviously by in Tony Lake's purview, and I was going to visit with him, bringing Jeff
Sachs with me.
- We did discuss this a bit last year, but I am hoping that the U.S.
could continue to expand its involvement in global health diplomacy strategies as a part of U.S. smart power agenda.
The global health program at Columbia - and a number of other academic centers - could provide resources, ideas,
programs, expertise and relevant research to bolster such efforts.
If you think it would be worthwhile, I would look forward to continuing our conversations.
Warm regards,
Irwin

Madam Secretary -
One of our Mexican staff and the husbands of two Mexican employees were killed last night in Juarez.
In one case a Mexican employee and her husband were leaving a party hosted by another Mexican employee. They were
in separate vehicles. He was stopped by a hit squad and killed before her.
In a second case a Mexican employee and her husband were killed leaving the same party. Their 3 month-old baby was
left alive in the back seat.
We have activated all investigative and intelligence channels to learn all we can. The head of Mexico's intelligence
service called to express President Calderon's condolences and to offer any support we need. Patricia Espinosa is aware.
She may call you. We will let you know if there are any leads on why this tragedy occurred.

Mort Zuckerman: World Sees Obama as Incompetent and Amateur
The president is well-intentioned but can't walk the walk on the world stage
By Mortimer B. Zuckerman
Posted June 18, 2010
President Obama came into office as the heir to a great foreign policy legacy enjoyed by every recent U.S. president.
Why? Because the United States stands on top of the power ladder, not necessarily as the dominant power, but
certainly as the leading one. As such we are the sole nation capable of exercising global leadership on a whole range of
international issues from security, trade, and climate to counterterrorism. We also benefit from the fact that most
countries distrust the United States far less than they distrust one another, so we uniquely have the power to build
coalitions. As a result, most of the world still looks to Washington for help in their region and protection against
potential regional threats.
Yet, the Iraq war lingers; Afghanistan continues to be immersed in an endless cycle of tribalism, corruption, and Islamist
resurgence; Guantanamo remains open; Iran sees how North Korea toys with Obama and continues its programs to
develop nuclear weapons and missiles; Cuba spurns America's offers of a greater opening; and the Palestinians and
Israelis find that it is U.S. policy positions that defer serious negotiations, the direct opposite of what the Obama
administration hoped for.
The reviews of Obama's performance have been disappointing. He has seemed uncomfortable in the role of leading
other nations, and often seems to suggest there is nothing special about America's role in the world. The global
community was puzzled over the pictures of Obama bowing to some of the world's leaders and surprised by his
gratuitous criticisms of and apologies for America's foreign policy under the previous administration of George W. Bush.
One Middle East authority, Fouad Ajami, pointed out that Obama seems unaware that it is bad form and even a great
moral lapse to speak ill of one's own tribe while in the lands of others.
Even in Britain, for decades our closest ally, the talk in the press—supported by polls—is about the end of the "special
relationship" with America. French President Nicolas Sarkozy openly criticized Obama for months, including a direct
attack on his policies at the United Nations. Sarkozy cited the need to recognize the real world, not the virtual world, a
clear reference to Obama's speech on nuclear weapons. When the French president is seen as tougher than the
American president, you have to know that something is awry. Vladimir Putin of Russia has publicly scorned a number of

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769103 Date: 08/31/2015
Oba ma's visions. Relations with the Chinese leadership got off to a bad start with the president's poorly-organized visit
to China, where his hosts treated him disdainfully and prevented him from speaking to a national television audience of
the Chinese people. The Chinese behavior was unprecedented when compared to visits by other U.S. presidents.
Obama's policy on Afghanistan—supporting a surge in troops, but setting a date next year when they will begin to
withdraw—not only gave a mixed signal, but provided an incentive for the Taliban just to wait us out. The withdrawal
part of the policy was meant to satisfy a domestic constituency, but succeeded in upsetting all of our allies in the region.
Further anxiety was provoked by Obama's severe public criticism of Afghan President Hamid Karzai and his coterie of
family and friends for their lackluster leadership, followed by a reversal of sorts regarding the same leaders.
Obama clearly wishes to do good and means well. But he is one of those people who believe that the world was born
with the word and exists by means of persuasion, such that there is no person or country that you cannot, by means of
logical and moral argument, bring around to your side. He speaks as a teacher, as someone imparting values and
generalities appropriate for a Sunday morning sermon, not as a tough-minded leader. He urges that things "must be
done" and "should be done" and that "it is time" to do them. As the former president of the Council on Foreign
Relations, Les Gelb, put it, there is "the impression that Obama might confuse speeches with policy." Another journalist
put it differently when he described Obama as an "NPR [National Public Radio] president who gives wonderful
speeches." In other words, he talks the talk but doesn't know how to walk the walk. The Obama presidency has so far
been characterized by a well-intentioned but excessive belief in the power of rhetoric with too little appreciation of
reality and loyalty.
In his Cairo speech about America and the Muslim world, Obama managed to sway Arab public opinion but was unable
to budge any Arab leader. Even the king of Saudi Arabia, a country that depends on America for its survival, reacted with
disappointment and dismay. Obama's meeting with the king was widely described as a disaster. This is but one example
of an absence of the personal chemistry that characterized the relationships that Presidents Clinton and Bush had with
world leaders. This is a serious matter because foreign policy entails an understanding of the personal and political
circumstances of the leaders as well as the cultural and historical factors of the countries we deal with.
Les Gelb wrote of Obama, "He is so self-confident that he believes he can make decisions on the most complicated of
issues after only hours of discussion." Strategic decisions go well beyond being smart, which Obama certainly is. They
must be based on experience that discerns what works, what doesn't—and why. This requires experienced staffing,
which Obama and his top appointees simply do not seem to have. Or as one Middle East commentator put it, "There are
always two chess games going on. One is on the top of the table, the other is below the table. The latter is the one that
counts, but the Americans don't know how to play that game."
Recent U.S. attempts to introduce more meaningful sanctions against Iran produced a U.N. resolution that is way less
than the "crippling" sanctions the administration promised. The United States even failed to achieve the political benefit
of a unanimous Security Council vote. Turkey, the Muslim anchor of NATO for almost 60 years, and Brazil, our largest ally
in Latin America, voted against our resolution. Could it be that these long-standing U.S. allies, who gave cover to
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Iran's nuclear ambitions, have decided that there is no cost in lining up with America's most
serious enemies and no gain in lining up with this administration?
The end result is that a critical mass of influential people in world affairs who once held high hopes for the president
have begun to wonder whether they misjudged the man. They are no longer dazzled by his rock star personality and
there is a sense that there is something amateurish and even incompetent about how Obama is managing U.S. power.
For example, Obama has asserted that America is not at war with the Muslim world. The problem is that parts of the
Muslim world are at war with America and the West. Obama feels, fairly enough, that America must be contrite in its
dealings with the Muslim world. But he has failed to address the religious intolerance, failing economies, tribalism, and
gender apartheid that together contribute to jihadist extremism. This was startling and clear when he chose not to
publicly support the Iranians who went to the streets in opposition to their oppressive government, based on a
judgment that our support might be counterproductive. Yet, he reaches out instead to the likes of Bashar Assad of Syria,
Iran's agent in the Arab world, sending our ambassador back to Syria even as it continues to rearm Hezbollah in Lebanon
and expands its role in the lran-Hezbollah-Hamas alliance.

The underlying issue is that the Arab world has different estimates on how to deal with an aggressive, expansionist Iran.
The Arabs believe you do not deal with Iran with the open hand of a handshake but with the clenched fist of power.
Arab leaders fear an Iran proceeding full steam with its nuclear weapons program on top of its programs to develop
intermediate-range ballistic missiles. All the while centrifuges keep spinning in Iran, and Arab leaders ask whether Iran
will be emboldened by what they interpret as American weakness and faltering willpower. They did not see Obama or
his administration as understanding the region, where naiveté is interpreted as a weakness of character, as amateurism,
and as proof of the absence of the tough stuff of which leaders are made. (That's why many Arab leaders were appalled
at the decision to have a civilian trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in New York. After 9/11, many of them had engaged
in secret counterterrorism activities under the umbrella of an American promise that these activities would never be
made public; now they feared that this would be the exact consequence of an open trial.)
America right now appears to be unreliable to traditional friends, compliant to rivals, and weak to enemies. One
renowned Asian leader stated recently at a private dinner in the United States, "We in Asia are convinced that Obama is
not strong enough to confront his opponents, but we fear that he is not strong enough to support his friends."
The United States for 60 years has met its responsibilities as the leader and the defender of the democracies of the free
world. We have policed the sea lanes, protected the air and space domains, countered terrorism, responded to
genocide, and been the bulwark against rogue states engaging in aggression. The world now senses, in the context of
the erosion of America's economic power and the pressures of our budget deficits, that we will compress our
commitments. But the world needs the vision, idealism, and strong leadership that America brings to international
affairs. This can be done and must be done. But we are the only ones who can do it.

Obama's diplomacy, not fully engaged
By Jackson Diehl
Monday, May 3, 2010; A15
Barack Obama's foreign policy has been defined so far by his attempts to "engage" with adversaries or rivals of
the United States, such as Ayatollah Ali Khamenei of Iran and Dmitry Medvedev of Russia. The results have
been mixed. But now the president's focus is visibly shifting. In the next 18 months, Obama's record abroad will
be made or broken by his ability to do business with two nominal U.S. allies: Hamid Karzai and Binyamin
Netanyahu.
Karzai has become the hardest problem in Obama's Afghanistan surge, one that might be summed up as "can't
win with him, can't win without him." Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu holds the key to whether Israel will be
prepared to accept a Palestinian state within the two-year time frame Obama has established -- and also,
perhaps, whether Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons will lead to war.
Both men are prickly and somewhat inscrutable. Both know their countries and their own careers depend on
support from the United States, but both are also resistant to key elements of Obama's policies. Handling them
well requires skillful and subtle diplomacy by the U.S. president and by those who carry out his policies.
And Obama has not done well. In fact, his treatment of the Israeli and Afghan leaders during one week in late
March -- immediately after his victory on health care -- marked a low point of his performance as president.
First, Obama seized on an errant Israeli announcement about housing construction in East Jerusalem to reopen a
pointless battle with Netanyahu. During a disastrous March 23 meeting at the White House, Obama demanded -
- in vain -- that Israel stop all building in Jerusalem; and at one point he left Netanyahu and his delegation to
stew in the Roosevelt room while he retired to the second-floor residence for dinner.
Five days later, Obama flew to Kabul for another cold meeting, this time with Karzai. In a briefing for reporters
on the plane, national security adviser James Jones made it clear that Obama was displeased with Karzai's lack
of progress since beginning a new term as president last fall. In case there was any doubt, Obama spelled out
that dissatisfaction in a television interview a day after his return.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769117 Date: 08/31/2015
Was it hubris from health care that brought on this burst of presidential imperialism? Whatever the cause, the
results were disastrous. Netanyahu retreated to Jerusalem, where, after a couple of weeks of sulking, he
defiantly announced that settlement construction in Jerusalem would continue. Karzai summoned Iranian
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to Kabul, then delivered a tirade against Western interference that concluded
with a threat to join the Taliban.
The administration has spent the past month cleaning up this mess. Obama abruptly changed his approach,
sending a note to Karzai in early April thanking him for the Kabul visit and confirming his invitation to visit
Washington in May -- a trip that, just days earlier, the White House had hinted at canceling. Meanwhile, the
president and a good part of his Cabinet have been heaping love on Israel -- if not precisely Netanyahu -- by
proclaiming their commitment to the relationship in speech after speech before pro-Israel groups.
The result is that the administration now has a detailed plan for working with Karzai over the next several
months. Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which have been delayed for two months by the flap over Jerusalem,
might finally begin this week. Quiet diplomacy by the administration's special envoys in the Middle East and
Afghanistan, George Mitchell and Richard Holbrooke, has achieved what presidential lectures did not.
The underlying problems, however, haven't changed. Karzai still has little appetite for attacking the corruption
in his government or rallying support for U.S. military campaigns against the Taliban. Netanyahu remains
wedded to a right-wing coalition that would not allow him to make significant concessions in peace
negotiations, even if he wanted to.
Obama has to find a way to coax each of them toward a change of course. Public bullying won't do it.
Assurances of U.S. support and stroking by special envoys go only so far. What's missing is personal chemistry
and confidence, the construction of a bond between leaders that can persuade a U.S. ally to take a risk; in other
words, presidential "engagement." Isn't that what Obama promised?

HOUSTON — (March 31, 2010) - Former First Lady Barbara Bush was discharged Wednesday from The Methodist Hospital
in Houston after undergoing a series of tests. Doctors believe Mrs. Bush, 84, may have had a mild relapse of her Graves
disease, a thyroid condition for which she was treated in 1989. As a result, her physicians at Methodist have adjusted
her medication. Upon discharge she was alert, talkative and appeared to be getting stronger as she prepared to return
home.
Mrs. Bush arrived Saturday at the hospital, where she received a number of tests including blood tests and imaging
studies. Just over a year ago Mrs. Bush received a replacement aortic valve at Methodist, which doctors said is working
very well.
Mrs. Bush is expected to make a full recovery and should soon return to her normal activities.

After Afghan Shift, Top U.S. Civilians Face Tricky Future By MARK LANDLER WASHINGTON — As General David H.
Petraeus takes command in Afghanistan, the two top American civilian officials in the war face an uncertain and tricky
future, working with a newly empowered military leader, under the gaze of an impatient president who has put them on
notice that his fractious war council needs to pull together.Richard C. Holbrooke, the Obama administration's special
representative to the region, and Karl W. Eikenberry, the ambassador to Afghanistan, both hung on to their jobs in the
uproar that followed Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal's career-ending quotes in Rolling Stone magazine.But privately, at least
one senior White House official suggested using General McChrystal's exit as an excuse for a housecleaning, according to
senior officials. That was rejected as too disruptive during a military campaign that relies heavily on civilian support,
these people said.ln recent days, other administration officials have begun floating the idea that Ambassador Eikenberry
might be replaced by Ryan C. Crocker, the highly regarded former ambassador in Iraq who forged a close partnership
with General Petraeus during the successful Iraq troop increase. Such a prospect is viewed as remote, given Mr.
Crocker's prestigious new post at Texas A&M University. But the fact that his name is being invoked underlines the
challenges that confront Ambassador Eikenberry, as he adapts to a new partner — one who has strong ideas about how
soldiers and diplomats should work together in war. It also illustrates the remarkably powerful role that General
Petraeus will assume in the nine-year-old war, setting him up as almost a viceroy in Afghanistan and a key broker in
negotiations between President Hamid Karzai and Pakistan over an eventual political settlement.Before General
Petraeus's arrival, some critics said the White House had created a problem by recruiting several forceful, ambitious
personalities and giving them jobs with overlapping responsibilities. Administration officials acknowledge that, as one
said, "there are obviously a number of substantial personalities on the team." But the White House believes that the
current lineup can mesh, and that a difficult war demands this much talent. Still, the McChrystal blow-up has
reverberated through the State Department. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton instructed Ambassador
Eikenberry and Mr. Holbrooke to take a hard look at the civilian team, two officials said. She is not wedded to the
current lineup if it continues to bog down in internecine battles, they said."You can't have a major shift in a civ-mil
structure without having the civilian side take a step back and look at everything," said a senior State Department
official, using the jargon for a civilian-military campaign.General Petraeus, whose appointment was approved 99-0 by
the Senate on Wednesday, took pains at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday to back a unified civilian and military
effort. He noted then that he had telephoned Mr. Holbrooke and would rendezvous with Ambassador Eikenberry in
Brussels, so the two could land in Kabul together."Holbrooke has been my wingman, to a great degree," General
Petraeus said in an interview. "We have had, and do have, a very good relationship." That role, he said, will now fall to
Ambassador Eikenberry.Ambassador Eikenberry was highly critical of the Pentagon's proposal last year to send 60,000
additional troops to Afghanistan, which led to a difficult relationship with General McChrystal. But in fact General
Petraeus was the true architect of the plan.The ambassador, a retired lieutenant general and former commander in
Afghanistan, graduated from West Point in 1973, a year ahead of General Petraeus, but they did not know each other at
the academy. The two share a scholarly bent: General Petraeus holds a Ph.D. from Princeton, while Ambassador
Eikenberry has master's degrees from Harvard and Stanford.While they were never assigned together, their careers
intersected twice. In Iraq, General Eikenberry led an assessment of Iraqi security forces while General Petraeus was
commanding the 101st Airborne Division in Mosul. When General Eikenberry was commander in Afghanistan, General
Petraeus led an assessment of Afghan National Security Forces.General Petraeus declined to discuss personnel issues,
while Ambassador Eikenberry and Mr. Holbrooke turned down requests for an interview. Mr. Crocker, now the dean of
the George Bush School of Government at Texas A&M, did not return a call for comment. For Mr. Holbrooke, the new
landscape is challenging in other ways. Officials said his job security was less in doubt than it was six months ago, when
his ouster was the subject of Washington chatter. Yet he has arguably become a less central player: Jacob J. Lew, a
deputy secretary of state, manages much of the civilian influx in Afghanistan that Mr. Holbrooke helped shape, while the
embassy in Kabul is carrying it out. Mr. Holbrooke's current portfolio has played to his weaknesses, his own allies admit.
He is best as a high-level negotiator, and not as comfortable with the nitty-gritty work of helping Afghanistan build an

economy.These days, Mr. Holbrooke has become a globe-trotting diplomat, trying to retain flagging European allies
while seeking to draw influential Muslim countries like Egypt into helping Afghanistan. At a recent conference of 35
countries in Madrid, Mr. Holbrooke drummed up more support from allies for the Afghan government's campaign to
reintegrate Taliban fighters into mainstream society.Mr. Karzai's longer-term effort to reconcile with Taliban leaders,
and his negotiations with Pakistan, could propel Mr. Holbrooke back into a central role. Were these talks to become
more serious, several officials said, Mr. Holbrooke's negotiating skills could be put to use, as a broker and guardian of
American interests. For now, though, as evidence of General Petraeus's influence, he will do most of the shuttling
between Kabul and Islamabad, the Pakistani capital.On his last visit to the region, Mr. Holbrooke met with Mr. Karzai
and with senior Pakistani officials, including the army chief of staff, Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. Mr. Holbrooke's past run-ins
with Mr. Karzai, several officials said, have not hindered his ability to deal with the Afghan leader, and Pakistani officials
said they trusted him. Husain Haqqani, Pakistan's ambassador to Washington, said that Mr. Holbrooke took time to
understand Pakistan's concerns. "Ambassador Holbrooke is liked by some, admired by others and seen as effective, even
by those who may not like him," Mr. Haqqani said.Still, General Petraeus is indisputably the key player, and he has
wasted no time asserting his control. On a secure videoconference call last Saturday, a person familiar with the call said,
General Petraeus threw his support behind a costly, and controversial, plan to install temporary generators to supply
more electricity to Kandahar, the Taliban stronghold that is the next major American military target.Mr. Holbrooke and
Ambassador Eikenberry swiftly assented.

Faisal Shahzad, the American of Pakistani descent who is in custody in the United States over the failed attack. He did

Hi Hillary,
B6
Just wanted to let you know that the ARC did give a $10 million grant (reduced to $3.8 because of political reasons) - but
it almost didn't get accepted by the Haitians because they didn't want oversight. But with Paul Farmer's help we
created a joint oversight process with PIH, KPMG and the Ministry of Health. Sadly its slow going. But my cousin at the
ARC is working to do the right things.... Any good words you can say about the ARC would be appreciated!
And we are trying to move things forward still...
As always, fondly,
Mark

SECURITY COUNCIL PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT ON THE RECENT INCIDENT IN THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN
The Security Council deeply regrets the loss of life and injuries resulting from the use of force during the Israeli military
operation in international waters against the convoy sailing to Gaza. The Council, in this context, condemns those acts
which resulted in the loss of at least ten civilians and many wounded, and expresses its condolences to their
families. The Security Council requests the immediate release of the ships as well as the civilians held by Israel. The
Council urges Israel to permit full consular access, to allow the countries concerned to retrieve their deceased and
wounded immediately, and to ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance from the convoy to its destination. The
Security Council takes note of the statement of the UN Secretary—General on the need to have a full investigation into
the matter and it calls for a prompt, impartial, credible and transparent investigation conforming to international
standards. The Security Council stresses that the situation in Gaza is not sustainable. The Council re-emphasizes the
importance of the full implementation of Resolutions 1850 and 1860. In that context, it reiterates its grave concern at
the humanitarian situation in Gaza and stresses the need for sustained and regular flow of goods and people to Gaza as
well as unimpeded provision and distribution of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza. The Security Council
underscores that the only viable solution to Israeli-Palestinian conflict is an agreement negotiated between the parties
and re-emphasizes that only a two-State solution, with an independent and viable Palestinian State living side by side in
peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours, could bring peace to the region. The Security Council expresses
support for the proximity talks and voices concern that this incident took place while the proximity talks are underway
and urges the parties to act with restraint, avoiding any unilateral and provocative actions, and all international partners
to promote an atmosphere of cooperation between the parties and throughout the region.

Background on the Women Deliver Conference CONTEXT The second Women Deliver conference will take place in
Washington, DC on June 7-9, 2010. This conference is an international gathering that focuses on maternal health and
will include an estimated 3,000 representatives from governments, civil society, multilateral organizations, and the
private sector. The aim of the conference is to generate political commitment and financial investment for fulfilling
Millennium Development Goal 5, which pledges a three-quarter reduction in maternal mortality and universal access to
reproductive health by 2015. The conference is one of several international gatherings this year that will include a focus
on maternal and child health (MCH). As you know, this issue will also feature at the G-8, where the Canadians are
offering a flagship initiative on MCH, and at the Millennium Development Goals Summit in September, where the UN
Secretary General is sponsoring a Joint Effort on Women and Children's Health. The US will be represented at the
Women Deliver conference by Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, Undersecretary of State Maria
Otero, Ambassador Melanne Verveer, and a host of other USG participants. Please note: You recently recorded a video
message that will open the conference.
The full script is below.
SUGGESTED TALKING POINTS
• For too long and in too many places, women have received inadequate care when they give birth. As a result,
childbirth remains a leading cause of death and injury to women worldwide. • The United States has elevated the
issue of maternal health in our development work through the Global Health Initiative, a $63 billion dollar proposal to
help countries improve health outcomes through strengthened health systems and integrated service delivery, with a
particular focus on the health of women, newborns and children. This conference—along with other international
gatherings this year, including the G-8 and the Millennium Development Goals Summit in September—presents a unique
opportunity to reinvigorate our commitment to maternal health. • When women prosper, their families and
communities prosper. Women deliver for the world – now the world needs to deliver for them. ADDITIONAL
BACKGROUND The theme of this year's Women Deliver conference is "Delivering Solutions for Girls and Women," with a
focus on political, economic, social/cultural, and technological solutions. Conference organizers plan to emphasize the
following messages:1) The Millennium Development Goals will not be achieved without investing in
women.2) There is just enough time, if the world commits funding now, to achieve Millennium Development Goal 5—
an additional US $10 billion annually by 2010 and US $20 billion by 2015.Women Deliver was launched at a conference
in London in 2007. Jill Sheffield is the President of the organization.
FINAL VIDEO SCRIPT WOMEN DELIVER CONFERENCEWASHINGTON, DC
I am delighted to welcome all of you to this conference and to thank you for the work you are doing to put maternal
health at the top of our development agenda. Your commitment to this issue has raised awareness and inspired action
around the world. We know that women represent our greatest opportunity for progress in this century. If the potential
of women is fully developed, everyone benefits. And this can't be done without improving maternal health. But for too
long and in too many places, women have received inadequate care when they give birth. As a result, childbirth remains
a leading cause of death and injury to women worldwide. The United States has elevated this issue in our development
work through the Global Health Initiative, a 63 billion dollar proposal to help countries improve health outcomes
through strengthened health systems, with a particular focus on the health of women, newborns and children. We
commend the Canadian government for focusing much-needed attention to this issue by offering a flagship initiative on
maternal and child health at the upcoming G-8 meeting in Muskoka. The US also congratulates the United Nations
Secretary General for convening governments, civil society, multilateral organizations, foundations and corporations to
engage in a much-needed global effort to promote women's and children's health. These efforts—and this conference—
present a unique opportunity to reinvigorate our commitment to maternal health, because when women prosper, their
families and communities prosper. Women deliver for the world – now the world needs to deliver for them. Thank you.

Subject: (AP) Rep. John Murtha of Pa. dies at 77
WASHINGTON (AP) - A spokesman says Democratic Rep. John Murtha of Pennsylvania, a retired Marine Corps officer
who became an outspoken critic of the Iraq war, has died. He was 77. He had been suffering complications from
gallbladder surgery. In 1974, Murtha became the first combat veteran of the Vietnam War elected to Congress. He
wielded considerable clout for two decades as a leader of the House subcommittee that oversees Pentagon
spending. But frustration over the Iraq war led him to call for an immediate pullout of U.S. troops in 2005. Murtha's
congressional career was clouded by questions about his ethics from the Abscam corruption probe in 1980 to more
recent investigations into the special-interest spending known as earmarks and the raising of cash for election
campaigns.

Subject: Murtha statement
You ok with this?
I was deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Congressman Jack Murtha. From the battlefields of Vietnam to the hills
of Western Pennsylvania to the halls of Congress, Jack Murtha lived by the Marine Corps credo "Semper Fidelis," never
wavering in his faithful commitment to the country he loved and the men and women who bravely defend her. In war
and in peace, he fought for what he knew was right, even when it was unpopular. He was a fierce advocate for working
families struggling with a changing economy and for better health care and equipment for servicemembers. And over
the course of more than three decades in Congress, he became one of our nation's most respected voices on national
security and foreign policy. Presidents of both parties sought his advice and generations of colleagues looked to him for
leadership and wisdom. As Senator from New York serving on the Armed Services Committee, I was fortunate to call
Jack a friend and mentor. And as Secretary of State, I continued to rely on his expertise and judgment. I knew that Jack
would always shoot straight, like the Marine he was, and never shy away from a difficult question or a tough fight. Today
our country has lost a decorated war hero and a distinguished public servant. The men and women of the our armed
forces have lost a tireless champion. And the people of Pennsylvania's 12th district have lost a neighbor, an advocate,
and a true friend. My thoughts and prayers are with them and with Jack's beloved wife Joyce and their family. He will be
sorely missed.

PESHAWAR (AP) - A local government official said a suicide car bomber attacked a tribal police patrol in northwestern
Pakistan, killing 10 policemen. Rasheed Khan says the attacker rammed his car into a vehicle carrying the police on a
main highway in the Khyber tribal area near the Afghan border. Another 15 people were injured in the attack. No
group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but Taliban militants often target Pakistani security forces.

Rep. Watson to retire
By Aaron Blake - 02/10/10 11:51 AM ET
Rep. Diane Watson (D-Calif.) is set to announce her retirement, according to Democratic sources.
Watson's central Los Angeles district isn't expected to be competitive in the general election, as it
carries a distinct Democratic advantage as a majority-minority district. President Barack Obama
won it 87-12 in 2008.
Former California State Assembly Speaker Karen Bass is thought to be an early front-runner to
replace Watson.
Watson, 76, has served in Congress since 2001. Prior to that, President Bill Clinton appointed her
ambassador to Micronesia.

May I ask that you find way to convey this to S appropriately?
He also asked for detailed info on measures to be taken at our points of entry for incoming travelers—key ministers very

spoke after the Interfax news agency cited a Russian arms industry source as saying Russia would freeze its unfulfilled
contract to sell S-300 missiles to Iran because of the sanctions.

Dear Madam Secretary:
I greatly appreciate your support of our efforts to improve USG outreach to the European Parliament (EP) and
wanted to provide you with a brief update on our progress. We have worked very hard at USEU to deepen and
intensify our relationship with the EP over the past several months. Specifically, we have,
(1) Increased the flow of high-level USG visitors to the EP. Recent visitors include Janet Napolitano, Dick
Holbrooke, George Mitchell, Dick Morningstar and Ron Kirk. These visits culminated last month in a
highly successful address by VP Biden to a Plenary Session of the EP. I hope that you will also address
a Plenary Session of the EP in the near term. (Your town hall meeting at the EP with young leaders last
year was well-received here.)
(2) Increased the flow and quality of EP interactions in Washington. We have facilitated a dramatic
increase in the number of EP delegations visiting Washington and a significant improvement in the level
of their access to high-level USG officials.
(3) Increased USEU outreach to the EP at every level. At the Mission, we are restructuring the way in
which we interact with EP leaders by institutionalizing responsibility for key relationships and
enhancing accountability. In the coming months, we expect to receive two additional FTEs at the
Mission to improve our ability to cover the EP. We have also encouraged our Embassies in member
State capitals to meet with European Parliament members.
Again, thank you for your interest and support for our efforts.
Bill Kennard

OSH - Kyrgyzstan appealed for Russian help to stop ethnic fighting that has killed at least 62 and left parts of its second-
largest city in flames, the worst violence since the president was toppled in April. The interim government in
Kyrgyzstan, which hosts U.S. and Russian military bases, said it was powerless to stop armed gangs from burning down
the homes and businesses of ethnic Uzbeks in parts of Osh. Gun battles raged throughout the night.
"We need the entry of outside armed forces to calm the situation down," interim government leader Roza Otunbayeva
told reporters. "We have appealed to Russia for help and I have already signed such a letter for President Dmitry
Medvedev."
Russian PM Putin and Otunbayeva discussed the situation in a telephone call on June 12, the Russian government's press
service said, without giving details.
A Reuters correspondent in Osh said gun battles had taken place through the night in an Uzbek neighbourhood. Gas was
shut off to Osh and some neighborhoods have no electricity. "Entire streets are on fire," Interior Ministry spokesman
Rakhmatillo Akhmedov said. "The situation is very bad. There is no sign of it stopping. Homes have been set ablaze."
Otunbayeva said Osh was also facing a humanitarian crisis as food was running out. She said her government had
decided to open the border to Uzbekistan to allow fleeing Uzbeks to escape, although it was not clear who controlled
the frontier. One witness said some women and children had made it across to the Uzbek town of Marhamat, 638 miles
from Osh, and camps had been set up for those without family in Uzbekistan. A spokeswoman for the Kyrgyz Health
Ministry said at least 62 people had been killed and 790 wounded in the violence, which is taking place in the southerly
power base of former president Kurmanbek Bakiyev, deposed in April by a popular revolt.
"Everywhere is burning: Uzbek homes, restaurants and cafes. The whole town is covered in smoke," local human rights
worker Dilmurad Ishanov, an ethnic Uzbek, said by telephone from Osh. "We don't need the Kyrgyz authorities. We
need Russia. We need troops. We need help."

Subject: (AP) Thousands flee ethnic riots in Kyrgyzstan; Russia sends troops to base
BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan (AP) - As minority Uzbeks flee the Central Asian nation of Kyrgyzstan by the thousands, Russia is
sending in a battalion of paratroopers to protect its air base in the country. More than 100 people have been killed and
about 1250 wounded in four days of ethnic violence spreading across southern Kyrgyzstan. Doctors and rights activists
say the actual toll is likely far higher than that official count, because wounded Uzbeks are too afraid of being attacked
again to go to hospitals. Mobs of ethnic Kyrgyz have been reportedly torching Uzbek villages and neighborhoods,
slaughtering residents. Authorities in Uzbekistan says more than 75,000 refugees have fled its neighbor. Most are said
to be women, children and the elderly, and many have gunshot wounds. While the Kremlin has refused Kyrgyzstan's
request for military help quelling the violence, the Interfax news agency reports Russia has sent about 300 paratroopers
to reinforce security at its air base. Kyrgyzstan hosts both U.S. and Russian military air bases, but they are in the north,
away from the ethnic rioting.

KIGALI (AP) - A judge in Rwanda granted bail to a U.S. lawyer on medical grounds. Peter Erlinder was arrested and
charged with genocide ideology late last month. Since his arrest he's been hospitalized multiple times. A judge in Kigali
granted Erlinder bail on medical grounds, but it wasn't immediately clear if Erlinder is allowed to leave
Rwanda. Erlinder's brother, Scott Erlinder, said he suspects political pressure from around the world contributed to the
judge's ruling.

WASHINGTON - Former Vice President Cheney was admitted to the hospital after experiencing discomfort, the latest
health scare for the 69-year-old Republican leader who has a long history of heart disease. Cheney was expected to
remain at George Washington University Hospital over the weekend, said spokesman Peter Long. It was not
immediately clear whether Cheney's health concern was related to his previous heart troubles. He sustained his last
heart attack, deemed a mild one, in February. Cheney was not feeling well and went to see his doctors at George
Washington University. On their advice, he was admitted to the hospital for further testing.

SUKKUR (AP) - Downpours are again swelling rivers and streams in Pakistan, where some 1,500 people have died in
flooding over the past two weeks.
Thousands are being evacuated as forecasters say more heavy rain could be on the way.
Pakistani officials estimate as many as 13 million people have been affected by the worst flooding in the country's 63-
year history.
Pakistan's prime minister says Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton called him to offer every possible assistance,
and NATO says it will help coordinate aid from partner nations.

boat in waters off the divided peninsula's eastern coast. ROK's coast guard said the fishermen were questioned for an
alleged violation of the DPRK's exclusive economic zone. The fishing boat was then taken towards a DPRK port. The
coast guard said it was not clear where exactly the fishing boat was operating when it was seized.

VIENNA - (AP) Iran has set up new equipment that will allow it to boost its efficiency at enriching uranium at higher
levels, diplomats said May 14. The move is likely to give the U.S. more leverage with Russia and China in its push for new
UN sanctions on Tehran. Iran's clandestine enrichment activities were discovered eight years ago and have expanded
since to encompass thousands of centrifuges churning out material enriched to 3.5 percent. But despite three sets of
Security Council sanctions meant to enforce demands of a freeze, Tehran moved to a new level in February, when it set
up a small program to produce material enriched to near 20 percent.

S., D/S, P, T, VCI, EUR, and SIP colleagues,
Attached is a draft of S. 's testimony for next Tuesday's SFRC hearing on the New START Treaty. Please let us
know if you have any proposed edits and suggestions as soon as possible, and no later than 2:00 pm tomorrow
(Friday). As you review this draft, a few reminders:
• The testimony should be around 5-8 minutes, and ideally on the lower end of that spectrum, so
suggestions that are word-count-neutral (or suggestions stripping or streamlining verbiage) are much
preferred.

• Unlike previous remarks, this is a public hearing and the testimony will be publicly available. I tried to
strip out language from previous remarks accordingly, and I have one question embedded therein on one
particular clause.
• While these remarks are drafted to be slightly more formal (as compared to the All Senators Brief), they
still should be as accessible as possible, esp. given the lack of extensive substantive expertise by many
of our SFRC Senators.
• Please return edits on a bureau-wide basis.
H, T, and VCI are also coordinating on a full briefing binder that we plan to deliver to S. by COB
tomorrow. We can certainly shoot that around to anyone who would like a pdf copy.
Thanks,
Dave

Dear Madam Secretary,
Minister Afzali of the Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs, Martyrs and Disabled (MOLSA) is working hard in her new role as
the only confirmed female minister within the Government of Afghanistan. MOLSA has been under-resourced by the
international community and the USG, and while we are not shifting significant funds to her ministry, we have

Minister Afzali views you as a role model and seeks your mentorship & support. She has explained some of her priorities
in the attached correspondence and would like to meet briefly with you at the Kabul Conference, a meeting. Time
permitting, we would recommend a brief session with some international and Afghan media present. Perhaps at some
point Secretary Solis can visit here and deepen the partnership with Minister Afzali.

Secretary Clinton may be one of the highest-profile attendees at Tuesday's Kabul Conference, but
Afghan women fear their opinions won't be heard—and they worry new deals with fighters will roll
back their hard-fought rights.
As Hillary Clinton prepares to attend Tuesday's Kabul Conference, Afghan women are delivering a plain message to
government and international officials: Women's voices should be heard.
"We have to be honest. With respect to the Kabul Conference, we have not been consulted," said Soraya Pakzad, founder
of a women's shelter in the western Afghan city of Herat. Her comment came during an unusually heated question-and-
answer session with Afghan Finance Minister Omar Zakhilwal and United Nations representative Staffan de
Mistura marking the end of a two-day women's conference. "We want to be involved in policy-making. We don't want our
presence to be purely symbolic."
"Women's rights and achievements should not be compromised in any peace negotiations or
accords."
The Kabul Conference is, in part, built on symbolism. A follow-up to January's London Conference, the gathering marks
the first time Afghanistan has played host to its international donors, a decision that is intended to showcase the transition
from foreign to Afghan ownership of national priorities. More than 65 international delegations are expected to descend
upon the Afghan capital, which is already enduring security crackdowns and traffic gridlock. Workers could be seen
Sunday painting curbs and planting flowers in advance of the foreigners' arrival.
Discussions will center around five topics, including economic development, agriculture, governance, and security. The
goal of the half-day event is to establish a framework for Afghan leadership in the setting—and execution—of the
country's political and economic direction.
•Ann Marlowe: The Republican Fight Over Afghanistan Although it remains to be seen how quickly the
Afghan government, long under-resourced and beset by allegations of corruption, will be able to take the reins from its
international donors, there is no question that Afghan ownership is the direction in which things are moving, on the
political, economic, and security fronts. And that is precisely why women feel the stakes for this week's meeting are so
high, particularly in light of new deals to empower local militias that might threaten women's rights.

"After the Kabul Conference, no one knows what else could be on the agenda apart from war escalations and
negotiations," said Orzala Ashraf, an Afghan human rights activist. "This is very important for us, to get a serious and
honest commitment from our government in the presence of all witnesses from the world that our voices will not be
silenced."
Ashraf and a number of other women's advocates view Tuesday's talks are their last, best shot at speaking out about their
concerns, with help from European and American officials who have been working hard to help them win a seat at the
table. In another show of support, Secretary Clinton and Danish Foreign Minister Lene Espersen will meet Tuesday
morning with a group of women leaders.
Regardless of this high-profile backing, many women say they have little faith in the process to produce anything aside
from more paper and more unkept promises.
"Women are very tired of all these conferences; the government is going to have to show commitments," said Selay
Ghaffar, an Afghan Women's Network board member. "We want things to change."
And it remains unclear how many Afghans outside Kabul, men or women, are paying attention to yet another gathering to
discuss their future.
"Women in the provinces don't even know about this," said Zainab, a young math teacher from Helmand province. "I
would say 60 percent of women have no idea this is going on."
Others say the presence of one or two women at the Kabul Conference isn't enough to make a difference. And they say
they fear the recent move from NATO to empower local militias to fight the Taliban, particularly in southern Afghanistan.
"This is very dangerous," said Shahida Hussain, a human rights advocate from Kandahar who worked as a community
organizer during the Taliban years. "We had militias during the communist years and Afghanistan was destroyed. We fear
war again."
Women leaders say that they want peace and are glad to welcome back former fighters, but only if they respect women's
constitutional guarantee to equal protections under the law.
"Women should be a constituent part of all bodies outlined in the Afghanistan Peace and Reintegration Plan," said the
women in a statement at the end of their meeting. "Women's rights and achievements should not be compromised in any
peace negotiations or accords."
In the meantime, women continue to fight for a voice as Tuesday approaches. After a weeklong flurry of conference calls,
embassy meetings, and lunchtime gatherings, two women aside from government ministers are now slated to speak.
And in a small victory for women, international officials agreed with Pakzad's assessment before pledging that women
would be more involved going forward.
"I agree, you were not consulted," said da Mistura, appearing to contradict the Afghan finance minister, who only a few
moments earlier had said that women's views had and would be included. "As usual, we have been paying lip service to
you and we are all at fault for that."

HANOI - Secretary Clinton expressed concern over Vietnam's arrests of dissidents, attacks on religious groups and curbs
on Internet freedom, but said the countries remained friends. The United States and Communist-run Vietnam marked
15 years of diplomatic ties this month and Clinton said the two countries had "learned to see each other not as former
enemies but as actual and potential partners, colleagues and friends. We have consistently moved in the direction of
engagement and cooperation, even on those issues where we disagree." Clinton spoke during a two-day visit to Hanoi
for the Asia-Pacific region's biggest security dialogue.

Subject: Ecuador Stop
As we discussed in the trip meeting-- I feel that we might miss an important opportunity if we don't try to fit Ecuador
into the Andean trip (Venezuela and Bolivia are out of the question). We could stop in Ecuador by leaving Peru early
Tuesday morning after the OAS GA. The Secretary could deliver her speech in Ecuador, visit w the President and arrive in
Colombia in the late afternoon. Delivering the speech in Quito would avoid upstaging the OASGA FMs in Lima.
The visit to Ecuador would advance already positive areas of cooperation, as well as underscore our desire to see Correa
succeed in achieving constructive institutional reform, while respecting and preserving democratic governance. Correa's
promise to reform Ecuador's political system and address social inequities resonates with a public disillusioned by
decades of corruption and political instability. His agenda is principally driven by nationalism, not anti-Americanism, and
although some of his economic policies mirror those of Venezuela, he is not following a recipe laid down by Chavez.
Despite its rhetoric, the Correa government has cooperated closely with the USG in many areas, including counter
narcotics, anti-corruption, and alternative development assistance. Although Ecuador can be a challenging partner, our
efforts to engage constructively with him are paying off. We had an excellent conversation during my April visit to
Quito, including an open and candid conversation on sensitive issues like freedom of the press and maintaining a
constructive dialogue with civil society. (The gift I gave him for his birthday, an edition of Living History signed by the
Secretary, had a strong positive impact on him. He said that his mother-- who lived much of her life in California is a
great admirer of the Secretary. ) Reporting after my meetings in Quito was very positive and seemed to indicate that
Correa is ready to move beyond the stale rhetoric surrounding the Colombia Defense Cooperation Agreement. Indeed,
there is a terrific opportunity to work tri-laterally with Peru, Ecuador and Colombia not only on counter drug matters-
- but also on environmental issues like deforestation and climate change given the enormous extension of the amazon
basin in those three countries. All three presidents welcomed the suggestion when I raised as a possibility. Working
with them helps to pull Ecuador away from Venezuela while helping to improve cooperation w Colombia.
In sum, a visit to Ecuador would add a sub-regional theme to the trip, engaging with the Andean countries in Lima,
Quito, and Bogota; and then with CARICOM in Barbados. The Secretary has been to Canada, Mexico, Central America,
and the Southern Cone.

Subject: (Sydney Morning Herald) Abbas ready for direct talks with Israel
Palestinian President Abbas said he was ready for direct negotiations with Israel, following Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's accusations that the Palestinians are avoiding the talks. "We are ready to hold direct peace negotiations
with Israel," Abbas told reporters after talks with Jordan's King Abdullah II in Amman. "We have negotiated with Israeli
governments before, more than once. Why would we avoid such talks? We are not."
Netanyahu told the parliamentary committee on foreign affairs and defense earlier July 26 the Palestinians were trying
to sneak out of direct negotiations while Israel was ready to start them "immediately." "We have an understanding with
the Americans that we need to move now, without any delay, to direct negotiations, but in response, we have a clear
Palestinian attempt to avoid this process," Netanyahu said. "They are trying to stall and to sneak away from direct
negotiations and to cause the Arab League to shackle the talks."
Netanyahu's remarks come just days ahead of a meeting in Cairo between Abbas and the Arab League at which the
Palestinian leader will discuss the indirect talks with Israel, which began in May, and will also address the pressing
question of a shift to direct negotiations.
Abbas has repeatedly said he would not move to direct talks without tangible progress on the key issues of borders and
security, and without a complete freeze on Jewish settlement building on occupied Palestinian land.
Abbas is due to meet Spanish Foreign Minister Moratinos July 27 in Amman before flying to Cairo.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi ruler King Abdullah meets Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad on July 29 to try to ease tensions in
Lebanon, capitalizing on an apparent weakening in Iran's position after a round of tough new sanctions. The monarch
will hold talks with Assad in Damascus before heading to Beirut where he will meet his ally Premier Saad al-Hariri,
President Michel Suleiman and pro-Western Lebanese political leaders, Saudi officials said. The monarch hopes to
convince Assad to accompany him to Beirut from Damascus, Lebanese officials say, although Syria has not confirmed
that Assad will oblige.

Subject: (AP) Kerry dismisses leak papers as largely meaningless
WASHINGTON (AP) - A senior Democratic senator is largely dismissing the significance of classified U.S. military
documents released over the weekend that portrayed a range of problems in the Afghan war. At a Senate Foreign
Relations Committee hearing, the panel's chairman, Senator John Kerry (D-MA), said people should not "overhype or get
excessively excited about" the disclosures. He said the release was unlawful and could potentially endangered U.S.
troops in Afghanistan. But he also said the secret documents should be given little weight because in many cases they
reflect raw intelligence, not carefully calibrated assessments of trends on the ground. Kerry's committee is holding a
hearing on the prospects for achieving a reconciliation between the Afghan government and the Taliban insurgency.

Dear Trustees and Trustee Associates,
I am writing to share an update on Fr. Beirne's health. Fr. Beirne called this morning to let me know that his
cancer has reached a stage where he has made the decision not to have any further clinical intervention. He
prefers to live out the time he has remaining, six months by the doctors' projections, without the sapping of
his energy and other side effects posed by his recent treatments. I have his permission to share this sad
news with you. You may write to Fr. Beirne at Murray-Weigel Hall where he is now living (see address
below) or phone him on his cell phone at
Murray-Weigel Hall
515 E. Ford ham Road
Bronx, NY 10458-5029
I am sure that you join me in offering prayers for Fr. Beirne as he faces the challenges his illness presents in
his final months with us.

CAIRO (AP) - Qatar's prime minister says the Arab nations have endorsed direct Palestinian talks with the Israelis but left
the timing to the Palestinians themselves. Sheik Hamad bin Jassem Al Thani, who chaired the meeting of Arab foreign
ministers in Cairo said July 29 the timing of the direct talks "is a matter for the Palestinian side to decide." The U.S. and
the Europeans have been pushing Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to restart the direct talks, which broke off in
2008, immediately. Abbas, however, has said he would only restart talks if Israel agrees to a halt in settlement
construction and accepts a Palestinian state in territories seized in the 1967 Middle East war, the West Bank, Gaza, and
east Jerusalem. He first wants progress in the current U.S. mediated indirect talks.

PARIS (AP) The U.S. Embassy in Paris says two of its employees are undergoing medical tests after handling a suspicious
letter. Embassy spokesman Paul Patin says employees in the mailroom identified a "suspicious letter" and French
authorities were summoned to examine it. He says "we have no indication that anyone is in danger or hurt" but that the
two employees who handled the letter are being examined by medical authorities. A Paris police official says the two
were feeling "unwell" and that the incident is being investigated.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) — Israel has rejected a Palestinian proposal to begin face-to-face peace talks on the basis of a
statement by major powers that would set their terms of reference. Reports in the left-wing dailies Haaretz and Maariv
said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told U.S. envoy George Mitchell that he wants direct talks to start immediately
but will not accept any preconditions. Netanyahu spokesman Mark Regev had no direct comment on the reports, which
said Mitchell's mission had "failed." Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas refuses to engage in direct talks before
Netanyahu agrees to a clear agenda.

Colleagues:
Further to our earlier alert, the press is widely reporting Somali gunmen disguised in army uniforms stormed a hotel
popular with government officials on Tuesday, and a legislator said at least 15 parliamentarians were killed. There was
no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.
The African Union confirmed at least 15 people were killed in the attack on the Huna Hotel, in a government-controlled
neighborhood between the presidential palace and the Indian Ocean. It did not say whether the dead were all MPs.
Embassy Nairobi spoke with President Sheikh Sharif who confirmed that seven MPs are now dead and numerous others
• are wounded. The number of attackers is not clear, but they were dressed in Transitional Federal Government military
uniforms. At least two blew themselves up.

GHAZI AIR BASE (AP) — The United States will increase its aid to flood-ravaged Pakistan to $150 million, U.S. Sen. John
Kerry said, stressing that Washington did not want Islamist extremism to increase on the back of the crisis. The United
States has deployed army helicopters to hard hit areas as part of a package worth $90 million. U.S. Sen. John Kerry, who
is visiting Pakistan to see the flood damage, said that would increase to $150 million. The figure is expected to be
announced at a U.N. general assembly meeting in New York August 19. He was speaking after meeting U.S. military
personnel taking part in helicopter relief missions.

Indian PM shows solidarity with Pakistan against floods
ISLAMABAD, Aug. 19 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called his Pakistani
counterpart Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani over phone Thursday to convey the condolences and
commensurations of his government and the people of India on the loss of precious lives
and damage to the properties and infrastructure caused by floods in Pakistan.
The Indian prime minister said that the member States in the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation should come together to help Pakistan in every way possible at this
critical juncture, according to the Pakistani PM office.
Gilani thanked his Indian counterpart for his kind gesture of calling him to express his
sympathies and solidarity with Pakistan in its hour of trial.
He briefed the Indian prime minister over the huge damage caused by this unprecedented
natural calamity in all the provinces of the country, which, according to UN estimates,
was far bigger than the effects of earthquakes and tsunami which hit Pakistan in 2005 and
Haiti last year respectively.
Gilani also availed the opportunity to reiterate Pakistan's keen desire to have friendly,
cooperative and good neighborly relations with India.
He hoped that in accordance with the agreement reached in Thimphu in Bhutan in April, the
bilateral dialogue between the two countries would progress a meaningful, substantive and
result- oriented way by addressing all the issues of concern to both countries including
Kashmir dispute.

Subject: (Reuters) U.S. Senate panel approves new arms treaty with Russia
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Senate panel approved a new strategic nuclear arms control treaty with Russia on
September 16, advancing one of President Barack Obama's main foreign policy priorities to an uncertain future in the
full Senate. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 14-4 to approve the new START treaty. The full Senate must
consent to the agreement before it can go into effect, but with Congress in the hottest part of the political season
before mid-term congressional elections, it is unclear when the treaty will get a vote on the Senate floor. The
agreement signed by Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in April commits former Cold War foes
Washington and Moscow to reducing deployed nuclear warheads by about 30 percent.
It picked up some Republican support in the foreign relations committee from Senators Bob Corker and Johnny lsakson.
They voted aye along with Richard Lugar, previously the only Senate Republican who had publicly supported the
treaty. But since 67 votes are needed to meet the two-thirds minimum required for treaties to pass the full Senate, at
least eight Republicans will have to vote for it. Most Republicans have remained uncommitted for months, leaving the
treaty's fate in limbo. The weak Republican support to date and the fact the Senate has a lot of business to take care of
before the congressional November 2 elections, makes the new START treaty a likely candidate for the "lame duck"
session to follow.
Obama wants the new START ratified this year as part of his "reset" of relations with Russia and a step toward his goal of
a world without nuclear weapons. Russia must also ratify the treaty, but is waiting to see what the United States will
do. The treaty is broadly supported as an important step forward in arms control by former senior security officials from
both Republican and Democratic administrations. But some Republican senators say they worry it may limit U.S. missile
defenses, and some want Obama to promise to spend more money modernizing the nuclear weapons that remain.

RIYADH (AP) - The Saudi king stepped down as head of the country's National Guard and transferred the influential

Agency reported that King Abdullah has named Prince Mitab bin Abdullah as commander of the National Guard. King
Abdullah had headed the force since 1962. The 86-year-old king also handed over his traditional supervisory duties for
the annual hajj pilgrimage to his deputy prime minister because doctors advised him to rest after rupturing a disc in his
back. Abdullah appeared on Saudi television receiving well-wishers for the Eid al-Adha holiday.

MUSCAT (AP) - An American woman released from Iran after more than 13 months in custody began her journey back to
the United States after asking her supporters to "extend your prayers" to her fiancé and another American man who
remain in Tehran accused of spying. In a brief statement, Sarah Shourd thanked Oman for mediating the $500,000 bail
that led to her freedom earlier this week. But she made no mention of her ordeal inside Tehran's notorious Evin Prison
or any health problems- which her mother has said include a breast lump and precancerous cervical cells. "Please,
please extend your prayers" to the other two Americans still held- her fiancé Shane Bauer and their friend Josh Fattal-
she said at Oman's international airport before boarding an Oman Air flight on the first leg of her trip home
accompanied by her mother Nora and an uncle. She was next scheduled to appear at a news conference in New York on
September 19 timed to coincide with the arrival of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to attend the UN General
Assembly. Shourd, 32, appeared in good spirits and less gaunt than when she stepped off a private Omani jet after her
release from Iran. She thanked Omani officials for playing an intermediary role between Iran and the United States for
her release. "I'll always associate your country with the first breath of my freedom, the sweet smell of sandalwood and
a chance to stand by the ocean listening to the waves," she said, wearing long-sleeve black T-shirt covered by a white
top and white sneakers.

Please pass to the Secretary
Madame Secretary,
I wanted to follow-up with you on my earlier note about the security situation in Monterrey. We have been working
very closely with Pat Kennedy to assess all of our options. Pat has shown tremendous flexibility and has provided
excellent counsel.
As we looked further into the Aug 20 shooting incident at the American School, it became clear that there many
competing versions about the causes behind the incident. We decided that it is best to leave this matter to local law
enforcement officials and to concentrate our review on whether it is possible to provide adequate security for the
children of U.S. personnel in Monterrey.
Our discussions with police and other security officials made clear that local police and private patrols do not have the
capacity to deter gangs and cartels from areas around the schools attended by the children of U.S. personnel. Local
authorities, we found, are not able to respond in a predictable and effective manner to calls for assistance. Given the
increasing level of violence that is occurring all over Monterrey, including near where our children go to school, we
determined that the only immediate, practical, and reliable way to reduce the security risks for all children is to relocate
them to the United States.
We are working with Pat Kennedy on the appropriate mechanism to formalize these arrangements. I have also advised
Secretary Espinosa and Nuevo Leon Governor Medina that we are moving in this direction. In parallel with this, I
recommitted to our Mexican counterparts that we will continue to do everything possible to support their efforts to
improve the security environment in Monterrey and other parts of the country.
Thank you for your support on this matter.

Subject: (AP) Israel Says No Building Freeze In Jerusalem
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel insisted November 18 it would keep building homes in disputed east Jerusalem, threatening to
hold up a U.S.-proposed settlement construction moratorium designed to renew deadlocked Mideast peacemaking.
The contours of the moratorium deal, as presented by Israeli officials after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu returned
from the U.S. last week, had appeared to be clearly agreed upon.
Washington, they said, had agreed to exclude the eastern sector of the holy city from the 90-day moratorium and there
would be no further demands for construction curbs in the West Bank when the latest moratorium expired.
On November 18, however, a day after Netanyahu said a deal was imminent, the U.S. still had not sent a promised letter
detailing the understandings on the proposed moratorium.
In Washington, a senior Obama administration official said the U.S. and Israel were still "haggling" over details of the
written assurances. The official said most of the unresolved issues were relatively routine but added that it was unlikely
that the letter would be finished Thursday.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter,
said it was not clear when the letter might be completed.
In a speech November 18, Netanyahu suggested agreement was neither imminent nor inevitable.
He said he has been holding intensive contacts with the Obama administration since his meeting with U.S. Secretary of
State Hillary Rodham Clinton a week ago.
"The objective is to formulate understandings through which we can promote the political process while maintaining the
vital interests of the state of Israel, primarily security," Netanyahu told students at the Technion, a technology school. "If
I accept such an offer from the U.S. government I will bring it before the Cabinet and I have no doubt that my fellow
ministers will accept it."
Earlier November 18, Netanyahu spokesman Mark Regev said any future moratorium would not apply to Jerusalem,
whose eastern sector was annexed by Israel in 1967 in a move not recognized by the international community.
He noted that an earlier settlement slowdown, whose expiration in September led to the current impasse in peace
efforts, did not include Jerusalem.
"Israel makes a clear distinction between the West Bank and Jerusalem," Regev said. "Jerusalem is our capital and will
remain as such. The previous moratorium did not apply to Jerusalem ... If there is a future moratorium, it will similarly

not apply to Jerusalem."
Palestinians want construction to halt in both areas, which they claim for their future state along with the Hamas-ruled
Gaza Strip. They have not said whether the partial freeze being brokered by the U.S. will be enough to draw them back
to the negotiating table.
The negotiations broke down in late September - just three weeks after they began at the White House - following the
expiry of a 10-month moratorium on new West Bank construction.
The U.S. hopes a renewed moratorium would allow Israel and the Palestinians to make significant progress toward
working out a deal on their future borders. With borders determined, Israel could resume building on any territories it
would expect to keep under a final peace deal.
To entice the Israelis to sign on to the deal, the U.S. has proposed a package of incentives including a gift of 20 next-
generation stealth fighter planes and U.S. pledges to veto anti-Israel resolutions at the United Nations, Israeli officials
have said.
But Netanyahu has been having trouble winning support from the plan even from his coalition allies. The ultra-Orthodox
Shas Party, which can make or break the deal, says it will let it go through only if Israel receives written assurances from
the U.S. that the building restrictions exclude Jerusalem.
In a sign of the backroom dealings in Israel around the deal, an official close to Shas said the party had received
assurances that if it abstains in the vote, Defense Minister Ehud Barak would authorize the construction of hundreds of
apartments in the West Bank immediately after the moratorium expires.
Some of the construction would take place in specifically ultra-Orthodox communities and other projects would be built
in a settlement just outside Jerusalem, giving Shas something to take back to constituents who might otherwise oppose
another moratorium.
The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal has not been officially announced. The Defense Ministry
did not reply to a request for comment.
Shas is critical to any moratorium deal because the inner Cabinet that will vote on it is almost evenly split, and Shas
holds the two swing votes.
The party's spiritual leader, a 90-year-old rabbi known for his harsh comments about Arabs, will make the final
determination on how to vote.

ZAGREB (AP) - Serbia's president will lay wreaths at the mass grave of Croats slain by Serbs during the 1991 war,
becoming the first Serbian leader to pay his respects to the victims of a massacre that remains a potent symbol of
wartime brutality.
Boris Tadic and his Croatian counterpart, Ivo Josipovic, on November 4 will also honor 18 Serbs killed by Croats in a
nearby village.
The visit to Ovcara, a pig farm near the eastern city of Vukovar where more than 200 Croat prisoners of war and
civilians were executed, is a "profoundly symbolic act," said Josko Paro, Josipovic's foreign policy adviser.

LISBON (AP) - NATO will start drawing down its troops in Afghanistan next July and its combat role in the war-torn nation
will end by 2014 or earlier so security can be turned over to the Afghans, a top alliance official said November 19. "We
think that goal is realistic, and we have made plans to achieve it, but of course if circumstances agree, it could be sooner,
absolutely," said Mark Sedwill, NATO's top civilian representative in Afghanistan. Sedwill said the troop withdrawal
starting next year will be "shallow" and eventually accelerate but did not elaborate. NATO spokesman James Appathurai
also said the alliance's 28 leaders, including President Barack Obama, were set to approve the withdrawal plan. He said
NATO is "quite confident of the end of 2014 timeline for handing responsibility to Afghan security forces" as requested
by Afghan President Hamid Karzai. Appathurai and Sedwill did not say how many NATO troops would stay in
Afghanistan after 2014 serving as military advisers and trainers.

rather than one driven by Europe or the IMF. The Irish Times said a separate plan for restructuring the banking sector
was also expected to be finalized November 20-21.

Mark,
You've probably heard that a bomb went off thisd morning in Laghman province, Aghanistan. The Governor of the
province is in Madrid at the end of a one-week visit to Poland, Germany, and Spain.
His message has been of support for ISAF and international development, which is helping Afghanistan defeat the enemy,
confront radical terrorists, and rebuild.
The Governor is considering release of a a statement from Madrid to news outlets this afternoon. We have offered
assistance in reaching media. Will keep you posted.
Please share this info, as appropriate, with those who should know in the Dept.
FOR KABUL:
While it appears that Insurgents hoped to capitalize on the NATO summit to send a message, and likely chose Laghman
because of it has been relatively peaceful and secure, this incident underscores the Governor's talking points that, while
Laghman has been peaceful and made great progress on all fronts in the past 9 years, Afghanstan still needs security and
development assistance to defeat the terrorists, who only bring destruction, fear, and oppression.

reached the Moncloa Director of International Communication, Juan Cierco, on the ground in Lisbon, who indicated to

Mark—
S has apparently scheduled a bilat with the Spanish Foreign Minister on the margins of the Lisbon summits. The MFA
press staff wants to coordinate with you on press availability and ground rules. If you agree, I would like to put you
directly in contact with them to work out the details. If you prefer, we can operate as a filter for you, but with the event
on top of us direct contact is probably going to work better.

CAIRO (AP) - Al-Qaida has released a new audio tape of Osama bin Laden in which the leader of the terror network calls
for the creation of a relief body to aid Muslims harmed in natural disasters and wars. In a copy of the message, bin
Laden also criticizes governments in Muslim countries for spending more money on armies than on their citizens. The
bin Laden tape comes after similar messages from al-Qaida figures that accused the Pakistani government of failing to
provide for its people after massive floods in the country killed hundreds and left some 8 million people homeless. The
authenticity of the tape could not be immediately verified.

Subject: (Jerusalem Post) PM: Cabinet to review US freeze deal when we get letter
(Jerusalem Post) Prime Minister Netanyahu met with Likud MKs and deputy ministers to discuss the U.S.
proposal for a 90-day construction freeze, November 21. In the meeting, Netanyahu told the Likud officials: "I
have a responsibility that includes making the best decision for the state of Israel and its national interests,
foremost, its security." He continued, 'We still haven't received the written agreement from the Americans on
the basic understandings." The prime minister assured those attending the meeting, "If we receive a written
agreement, I will bring it to the cabinet and I am sure that the ministers will approve it because it is what's best
for the state of Israel." He added, "If we don't receive such a document, I won't bring the issue [of a freeze] to
the cabinet."
Earlier in the day thousands of settlers protested outside the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem against the
potential freeze. National Infrastructures Minister Uzi Landau, an opponent of an additional freeze, addressed
the demonstrators. Dozens of youngsters also blocked the entrance to Jerusalem. Police dispersed the
protesters and arrested two people. Over the weekend, Kadima MK Avi Dichter told The Jerusalem Post, "The
total freeze for 10 months was a serious mistake," said Dichter. "It was clear that it would come to an end, and
that in those 10 months nothing dramatic could happen between Israel and the Palestinians — leaving us in the
same situation as at the beginning."
"Netanyahu made a second mistake when he didn't agree to the American request to extend a two-month
freeze immediately on September 26, and insist that it was the last freeze. If he had, we'd be one week away
from the end, rather than in our current state," he said. Dichter said the "main problem is that the topic of the
freeze has become the central topic of discussion, rather than talks between us and the Palestinians.

TEHRAN (AP) - Iran set a February 6 trial date for three Americans arrested more than a year ago along the Iraqi border
and charged with spying, their lawyer said. The trial was to have started on Nov. 6, but authorities said they delayed it
because one of the Americans, who was freed on bail, had not been summoned to return to the country to appear in
court. Their lawyer said he received an official notification of the new trial date November 21. Iran warned that it will
seize the $500,000 bail posted by released hiker Sarah Shourd if she does not return for trial. Shourd has not disclosed
any plans to return to Iran. She said in an interview published Oct. 31 in The New York Times that the three stepped off
an unmarked dirt road and inadvertently crossed from Iraq only because a border guard of unknown nationality
gestured for them to approach.

President Hamid Karzai's reconciliation discussions with the Taliban. "In certain respect we do facilitate that, given that,
needless to say it would not be the easiest of tasks for a senior Taliban commander to enter Afghanistan and make his
way to Kabul if ISAF (International Security Assistance Force) were not....aware of it and therefore allows it to take
place," he said. "That's about as far as I can go on that at this point."

Subject: (AP) Officials think bin Laden involved in Europe plot
WASHINGTON (AP) — Osama bin Laden emerged October 1 as possibly a key figure in the European terror plot, and
officials said he may be flexing his muscles in a move to show a besieged al-Qaida remains strong and able to launch
major attacks on western targets. U.S. counterterrorism officials said they believe that senior al-Qaida leaders, including
bin Laden, were involved in the plan to strike several European cities in a coordinated assault. If bin Laden had a direct
hand in the planning, it would be the most active role he has played in a terror plot since the 9/11 attacks, according to
U.S. officials and analysts.
Counterterrorism officials said that they are now working under the assumption that bin Laden played a role in the
plotting, but they would not detail what indications they've seen that led them in that direction.
Still, some also believe that bin Laden's orders may have been delivered by one of his top commanders, since the al-
Qaida leader is known to avoid close contact with anyone except his closet confidants.
While bin Laden's name is still a powerful reminder of the World Trade Center's twin towers and the Pentagon
engulfed in flames, U.S. officials have for months asserted both in private and in hearings on Capitol Hill that his core al-
Qaida group is weakened, struggling to raise money and attract recruits.
"Clearly there is a great deal of pressure on al-Qaida to do something to show that it is still alive and kicking," said
Richard Barrett, the head of a U.N. group that monitors the threat posed by al-Qaida and the Taliban. "They need to
show they're strong, they're a force multiplier, that they've still got some beef, that they've got operators abroad, that
they can do things."
Barrett said al-Qaida's Pakistan-based network has not launched a successful attack since the London subway
bombing in 2005. "In order to attract the younger new recruits, I think they have to do a bit better than that," he said.
The multi-pronged scope of the emerging terror plan _ which aimed to launch coordinated shooting rampages or
attacks in Britain, France and Germany _ is an al-Qaida hallmark.
U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, declined to reveal what evidence
they have that bin Laden took a more prominent role in this plan. And one U.S. intelligence official cautioned that the
details of how the plan was directed or coordinated by the group's core leaders is not yet clear.
The involvement of bin Laden and his devoted leaders, believed to be in hiding in Pakistan, underscores continuing
U.S. concerns about that country's role as a safe haven for al-Qaida and other Islamic extremists.
And it reflects al-Qaida's persistent effort _ through video and online messages _ to inspire its followers to wage
attacks against the West. The threat to Europe was highlighted when bin Laden issued a call to arms in March 2008 after
a Danish newspaper printed controversial cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad.
He warned Europeans in an audio message that there would be a "severe" reaction to come.
Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich., the senior Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said that bin Laden may
simply be trying to re-exert himself. And his role in the European plot could suggest a lack of confidence by al-Qaida
central in the ability of other affiliated groups in Yemen or Africa to carry out a successful attack on their own, Hoekstra
said.
Over the past year, several terror attacks in the U.S. have either failed or been foiled, including the botched attempts
to bring down a Detroit-bound airliner on Christmas Day and to set off a bomb in New York's Time Square.
"They've let other people take the lead on attacking the West," said Hoekstra, adding that bin Laden may now be

thinking, "these guys can't do it, we've got to become more involved again."
Bin Laden's presumed role in the European plot was first reported by NPR.
One senior U.S. official, meanwhile, discounted any involvement in the Europe terror plot by al-Qaida's North African
affiliate. While al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb is dangerous in its region and may want to export its terror operations to
Europe, there are no indications that it is able to do that at this time, said the official.
A Pakistani intelligence official said Thursday that eight Germans and two British brothers are at the heart of the
European terror plot, which is still in its early stages. One of the Britons was killed in a recent CIA missile strike, he said.
Pakistan, Britain and Germany are tracking the suspects and intercepting their phone calls, the official told The
Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information to the media.
U.S. officials have pressed Pakistan to increase its efforts to root out the militants hiding in the mountainous border
region.
The U.S. has dramatically stepped up its missile attacks in North Waziristan, and is believed to have launched at least
21 this month. The covert campaign is largely carried out by CIA drones and has led to the deaths of a number of top
militant leaders.
Pakistan has complained vocally about the program but is believed to provide intelligence assistance for at least some
of the strikes.

TEHRAN (AP) - Syrian President Bashar Assad offered dim hopes Saturday for any success in Middle East peace talks,
saying the White House is only using its mediation between Israelis and Palestinians to score political points in the
United States. The comments by Assad during a one-day visit to Tehran followed talks with Iranian President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad. Both leaders pledged to support "resistance" in the region, an apparent reference to Palestinian militants
and others opposing Israel.

Palestinians Say Talks With Israel Should Be Suspended
By ETHAN BRONNER
New York Times
RAMALLAH, West Bank — The Palestinian leadership said Saturday that four-week-old direct talks with Israel should be suspended as
long as Jewish settlement housing was being built in the West Bank. It called on the international community to pressure Israel to stop
the construction.
A statement issued after a meeting of about 35 Palestinian leaders — the executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization,
the central committee of the main Fatah movement and a handful of others — held at the compound of the Palestinian Authority
president, Mahmoud Abbas, said that Israel was responsible for the deadlock.
"The leadership confirms that the resumption of talks requires tangible steps, the first of them a freeze on settlements,"Yasser Abed
Rabb°, a senior P.L.O. official said after the three-hour meeting. "The Palestinian leadership holds Israel responsible for obstructing the
negotiations."
The Obama administration envoy to the region, George J. Mitchell, met repeatedly in recent days with Mr. Abbas and Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel in hopes of keeping the new talks alive. But he left on Friday, having made no progress.
Mr. Mitchell remains in the region, talking with Arab leaders before an Arab League meeting planned for next Friday in Libya, where
the issue of direct talks with Israel will be debated and where, Mr. Abbas has said, a final decision on the future of the talks will be
made.
Barring a last-minute deal, the talks seemed to be in deep trouble.
Mr. Abbas was due to see King Hussein of Jordan on Sunday and then Hosni Mubarak, the president of Egypt, as efforts continue to
find a solution.

Israel halted most settlement construction for 10 months last November, saying it viewed the politically difficult step as a gesture to lure
the Palestinians into direct peace talks. Mr. Abbas consented to the talks nine months later but threatened to abandon them if the freeze
was lifted.
Mr. Netanyahu argues that the future of the settlements should be part of a mix of issues to be discussed in the coming year of talks, not
a precondition for talks. The Palestinians say the Israelis agreed to end settlement expansion in a 2003 road map for peace and have
failed to live up to that commitment. They add that settlements violate international law and are eating up the land on which they plan
to build their state.
Mr. Netanyahu told his close aides on Friday that he would not freeze settlements further but would limit the building, according to an
official briefed on that meeting.
"Everyone knows that restrained and moderate building in Judea and Samaria in the coming year will not affect the peace map at all,"
he said, according to the official, using the biblical term for the West Bank. "Therefore the international community must call on the
Palestinians to stay in the peace talks. It is in the interest of the Palestinians, just as it is in ours."
Since Mr. Abed Rabbo on Saturday also asked for assistance from the international community, it now appears that both sides, instead
of talking to each other, have returned to making their cases to the world, hoping other governments will intercede on their behalf.
The Obama administration has offered Israel security guarantees and military hardware in exchange for a one-time 6o-day extension of
the building freeze. But so far Mr. Netanyahu has turned that down, saying that sticking to his word on a one-time freeze was more
important than the elements of the American offer.
The Palestinians say they, too, have concerns about credibility if they return to talks while settlement building resumes.
Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a close aide to Mr. Abbas, said Saturday that Mr. Abbas had staked his credibility on ending negotiations if
settlements began again. Asked how to assess the diplomacy of recent days, Mr. Abu Rudeineh said, "So far efforts have reached a dead
end."

Subject: (AP) Peace talks come and go, but a settlement grows
REVAVA (AP) - The American president was pushing hard for a Mideast peace agreement when six Jewish families
arrived on this West Bank hilltop early one morning with cribs, refrigerators, Israeli flags and flatbed trucks carrying
mobile homes.
White House condemnation came quickly: "Settlements are an obstacle to peace and their continuation does not
contribute to the development of a peace process which we have all been working toward."
It was April 16, 1991.
Since then peace talks have started, stopped, restarted, and now it's President Barack Obama's turn to feel frustrated.
Last week Israel ended its temporary settlement freeze, Palestinians threatened to quit the talks Obama has brokered,
and settlers were celebrating in Revava, where those first trailers have been replaced by red-roofed suburban homes
and six families have become 250.
The story is the same across the West Bank, where settlements have evolved from tenuous Jewish footholds into a
massive presence across the hilly country which Israel captured in the 1967 war and which Palestinians want for their
own state.
They have grown steadily through years of international condemnation, diplomacy, periods of violence and
negotiations. They have often expanded as a direct protest against negotiations and the possibility that an Israeli
government might uproot them.
In 1991, when the first Bush administration was coaxing Israelis and Palestinians to the negotiating table, 90,300
Israelis lived in settlements across the West Bank. Today there are 300,000, and their population is growing by 5 percent
a year, more than 2 1/2 times the growth rate inside Israel.
The settlements themselves, ranging from small cities to isolated enclaves, take up just one percent of the area of the
West Bank, according to government maps analyzed by Israeli human rights campaigners. But their impact is much
greater than that number would suggest; the settlements and their access roads form a web of Israeli control that
Palestinians say rules out any chance of viable statehood.
Nowhere is the expansion, and its interplay with the politics of peacemaking, more apparent than at Revava.
When those first families arrived on this rocky hill next to the Palestinian village of Kifl Hares, President George H. W.
Bush's secretary of state, James Baker, was en route to Israel on a round of shuttle diplomacy.
One settler leader, Daniella Weiss, told The Associated Press at the time that they had "hurried the decision" on
Revava to undermine Baker's plans.
Government permits had been issued and the land, settlers said, had been quietly purchased from local Palestinians.
The Israeli government was led, as it is now, by the Likud Party, historically a champion of West Bank settlement,
claiming the territory as part of the biblical Land of Israel promised by God and as indispensable to Israel's security.
Some ministers in the government of then-prime minister Yitzhak Shamir reacted sourly to Revava's establishment;
the government was trying to mollify the U.S. and appear receptive to peace while simultaneously settling Jews in the
West Bank according to its own master plan. But the balancing act was becoming increasingly precarious.
Israeli doves were furious about Revava. Lawmaker Yossi Sand likened it to "planting a bomb aboard (Baker's) plane in
order to blow up his mission."
The settlers were young couples raised in observant Jewish homes. Gideon and Miri Goldis arrived with boxes of

possessions and three children under age 3. Nineteen years later, the family lives in a neat stucco home and have nine
children.
"I had the good fortune to come to a rocky, empty hilltop and start a Zionist settlement enterprise that my
grandfather could only dream of. Suddenly there was another ZIP code in the post office and another place on the map,"
Gideon Goldis said last week.
"I don't know what Baker wanted, or what Obama wants now, or any other leader - these are secondary," he said.
"What comes first is my people, their birthright and their security."
Since the Goldises arrived, six Israeli prime ministers have held peace talks with the Palestinians. Some have officially
restricted settlement construction. Through all of this, Revava has kept growing.
Settlements sometimes went up with the intention of forestalling concessions and in response to international
pressure, said Israeli writer Gershom Gorenberg, who has documented the history of the settlement movement.
"The red-tiled houses on the hilltops remain as monuments to the fallen peace initiatives of the past," he said in an
interview.
Unlike the Likud leaders of two decades ago, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he accepts Palestinian
statehood in at least part of the West Bank. But the Palestinian leadership sees settlement construction as the true
litmus test of Israeli intentions, and insists the freeze must be maintained.
The settlers see themselves as the aggrieved party, at odds with the Palestinians, the White House, and often their
own government. At Revava's celebrations last week, a sign with Obama's picture referenced the controversy over the
planned Islamic center near Ground Zero in Manhattan, saying: "If Islam can build anywhere, why can't I?"
Gideon Goldis' father, Avraham, was a metallurgical engineer in Philadelphia before he immigrated to Israel. In 2000
he followed his son to Revava.
Beyond ideology, he said, he found a close-knit community 10 minutes' drive from central Israel. A house in Revava
costs about $270,000, he said, a fraction of the price in Israel's center.
"The Americans said, 'you're torpedoing our efforts," said Goldis, 73. "We say, 'we're coming to live in Israel, why
can't we live wherever we want?"
Two decades after Baker's trip, with a new push under way for a peace agreement that would require Israel to cede
most or all of the West Bank, is Goldis concerned about Revava's future?
"I'm not worried at all," he said.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan will only re-open a supply route for coalition troops in Afghanistan once public anger
over NATO incursions eases and security improves, the foreign ministry spokesman said October 3.
Militants threatened more attacks on tankers carrying fuel to Afghanistan through routes in Pakistan to avenge the
incursions.
"Unless the reaction cools down and we make sure that the supply line is secured, we cannot reopen it," Foreign
Ministry spokesman Abdul Basit told Reuters.
Angered by repeated incursions by NATO helicopters over the past week, Pakistan blocked a supply route for NATO
troops in Afghanistan after one such strike killed three Pakistani soldiers on September 30 in the northwestern Kurram
region.

(U) Coordinator of the Mariam's efforts, Samar al-Hajj, told the LBC television channel on Saturday that contacts are
ongoing with countries near Gaza in order to acquire permission for the ship to dock at one of their ports. She
complained, "It seems as if there is universal war against us....We will not allow anyone to cancel the ship's trip." She
added that the ship will not head to Gaza directly from Tripoli, stressing, "The ship cannot be the reason for the start of a
war."

Subject: (AP) Interview: Ahmadinejad says future is Iran's- added quotes
NEW YORK (AP) - Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said "the future belongs to Iran," and challenged the United
States to accept that his country has a major role in the world. The comments came in an hour-long interview with The
Associated Press on the first day of his visit to the United States to attend the annual general assembly of the United
Nations this week. He insisted that his government does not want an atomic bomb- something he has said in the past-
and that Iran is only seeking peace and a nuclear-free world. He gave no indication of when Iran would resume talks on
its nuclear program and said any anti-nuclear sanctions against his government would have no effect on his
government's policies. Appearing calm and self-assured, the Iranian president said he was pleased about the release of
American hiker Sarah Shourd from a prison in Tehran, but said her two companions still in prison would have to prove
their innocence on charges that they illegally crossed into the country. "The United States' administrations.., must
recognize that Iran is a big power," he said. "Having said that, we consider ourselves to be a human force and a cultural
power and hence a friend of other nations. We have never sought to dominate others or to violate the rights of any
other country. "Those who insist on having hostilities with us, kill and destroy the option of friendship of us in the
future, which is unfortunate because it is clear the future belongs to Iran and that enmities will be fruitless- and hence
sanctions, too, will be ineffective." He added: "If they were to be effective, I should not be sitting here right
now." Ahmadinejad asserted that international nuclear regulators had never found proof that Iran is pursuing an atomic
bomb. "We are not afraid of nuclear weapons. The point is that if we had in fact wanted to build a nuclear bomb, we
are brave enough to say that we want it. But we never do that. We are saying that the arsenal of nuclear bombs
(worldwide) have to be destroyed as well," he said. The U.S. accuses Iran of hiding plans to build a nuclear bomb; Iran
denies that and says it's working only toward building nuclear power plants. On the case of the American hikers,
Ahmadinejad said, "We're very glad that that lady was released. (Due) to the humanitarian perspective of the Islamic
Republic chose to adopt on the subject, she was released on bail. And we hope that the other two will soon be able to
prove and provide evidence to the court that they had no ill intention in crossing the border, so that their release can
also be secured." Tying the case to Iran's assertion that some of its citizens are being held unjustly in the United States,
he said, "It certainly does not give us joy when we see people in prison, wherever in the world that may be, and even
when we think of prisoners here." His answers were translated from Farsi by an Iranian translator, but Ahmadinejad
appeared to be following the questions in English and occasionally corrected his interpreter. Asked about retired FBI
employee Robert Levinson, who disappeared during a trip to Iran in 2007, Ahmadinejad appeared to suggest that he
may have been Iran for suspicious reasons. "The U.S. government had informed us of this situation and we announced
that we are unaware of it. We agreed to establish a joint information committee to trace... his whereabouts. "Of course
if it becomes clear what his goal was, or if he was indeed on a mission, then perhaps specific assistance can be given,"
the Iranian said. "For example, if he had plans to visit with a group or an individual or go to another country, he would
be easier to trace in that instance." Levinson was last seen on Iran's Kish island in March 2007 where he had gone to
seek information on cigarette smuggling for a client of his security firm. He had been an FBI agent in New York and
Florida before retiring in 1998. He has not been seen since. Iran says it has no information on him.

NORFOLK (AP) - A jury in Virginia has convicted five Somali men of piracy for their attack on a U.S. Navy ship off the coast
of Africa.
Jurors returned the guilty verdict November 24 in Norfolk after deliberating 10 hours over two days. The verdict is the
first piracy conviction in a U.S. courtroom in nearly 200 years.
The conviction carries a mandatory life term.
The defendants were charged with attacking the USS Nicholas on April 1 as it patrolled off the coast of Somalia.
The men claimed they were fishermen who were kidnapped, beaten and forced into piracy.

presidential office said the meeting of senior security and economic officials was due to start at 0800 local (2300 GMT

prevent tensions with North Korea from hurting the economy, which is becoming more reliant on domestic consumer
spending for growth as exports are beginning to lose steam.

SEOUL (Reuters) — North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and his son and successor Jong-un visited the artillery base from
where shells were fired at a South Korean island just hours before the attack, South Korean media reported on
November 25. North Korea's attack on Yeonpyeong Island that killed two South Korean marines and two civilians
November 22 was probably ordered by Kim Jong-il himself, the Joongang Daily quoted a well-informed government
source as saying. Seoul government officials contacted by Reuters could not comment on the reports. South Korean
media reported the father and son had met General Kim Kyok-sik, the commander of the frontline fourth corps in charge
of a Navy base in South Hwanghae province, just before the North shelled the island. JoongAng Daily quoted a source as
saying that Kim visited the coastal artillery base in Gaemori from where the shells were fired with his son a day before
the attack.

Please Pass to the Secretary
Madame Secretary,
A shoot out occurred on August 20 in front of the American School in Monterrey (AFSM), resulting in the death of two
bodyguards. An investigation is continuing into the details, but our understanding at this point is that it was an
attempted kidnapping targeting the relatives of a local business executive. While it does not appear that U.S. families
were targeted, the sharp increase in kidnapping incidents in the Monterrey area, and this event in particular, present a
very high risk to the families of U.S. citizens who might be become incidental victims.
U.S. security and law enforcement personnel have engaged local and federal security officials to seek their help on
understanding the immediate risks and measures that can be taken. I have urged U.S. families at the Consulate in
Monterrey not to send their children to school in the coming days while we review the events that took place on August
20. We also are advising U.S. citizens in the area that we have urged Consulate personnel not to send their children to
school while we complete this security review.
I am sure that the warden notice will lead to a rash of press reports on U.S. concerns about security in Monterrey. More
broadly, if the government cannot get the kidnappings in Monterrey under control, that may affect our ability to
function in Monterrey. I have advised Secretary Espinosa of this, and have sought her help as well to address consulate
security.
Consulate personnel are currently on "authorized departure" and have the option to send their families to a U.S.
location. Pat Kennedy is in close touch on these matters.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq's president formally asked Prime Minister Maliki to form a new government, giving him 30
days to choose a cabinet from among Iraq's fractious Shiite, Kurdish and Sunni political factions. The request from
President Talabani came two weeks after political leaders reached an agreement to divide up the top government jobs,
a deal that put Maliki, a Shiite, on track for a second term as premier. The power-sharing pact, more than eight months
after an inconclusive March 7 parliamentary election, offered some hope that Iraq could avoid a return to the sectarian
warfare that killed tens of thousands of people at its peak in 2006-07. The deal gave Talabani, a Kurd, another term as
president and installed Sunni lawmaker Osama al-Nujaifi as speaker of parliament. Among Maliki's biggest decisions are
his choices to head the oil and finance ministries.

BAGHDAD (AP) — Iraq's Prime Minister will travel to Iran and Jordan to seek support for his bid to win a second term more
than seven months after national elections. His adviser Ali al-Moussawi said the prime minister will assure the
neighboring states that none of Iraq's major political constituencies will be excluded from a new government if they back
his second term. Al-Maliki will meet Jordan's King Abdullah II on October 17. He will meet with Iran's President
Ahmadinejad and the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei in Tehran on October 18. He will also visit Turkey and Egypt
next week.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on the Palestinian leadership to renounce an
official Palestinian report asserting the Western Wall, one of Judaism's holiest sites, is not Jewish. Al-Mutawakil Taha,
deputy information minister in the Palestinian Authority, published a five-page study disputing Jews' reverence of the
shrine as a retaining wall of the compound of Biblical Jewish Temples destroyed centuries ago. "Denial of the
connection between the Jewish people and the Western Wall by the Palestinian Authority's Ministry of Information is
baseless and scandalous," Netanyahu said in a statement issued by the prime minister's office. "The Israeli government
expects the leaders of the Palestinian Authority to renounce the document and condemn it, and to stop twisting
historical facts," he said. In the report, Taha wrote the Western wall is a "Muslim wall and an integral part of al-Aqsa
mosque and Haram al-Sharif," a position echoing past statements by the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Taha
issued the document after Israel approved five-year renovation plan for the Western Wall area.

President Abbas met with leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organization and his Fatah movement at his headquarters in
the West Bank. The Palestinians plan to study their options in coming days, said Yasser Abed Rabbo, the secretary
general of the PLO. "These political options include going to the U.N. and to the Security Council," he said. Mohammed
lshtayeh, a senior Fatah official, said the Palestinians will have prepared options by the time they consult with the Arab
League in three weeks.

Tehran November 27 to rally Iran's support for his efforts to keep Lebanon stable amid tensions over a UN probe into
the assassination of his father, Rath( Hariri.
The visit follows President Ahmadinejad's October tour of Lebanon, during which the Iranian leader reinforced
Tehran's ties to the Lebanese militant Hezbollah group, a longtime protege of the Shiite powerhouse.
The exuberant welcome the Shiite Hezbollah staged for Ahmadinejad in Lebanon threw Hariri's Western-backed
factions in the government on the defensive.
After touchdown in Tehran, Hariri was greeted by Iran's Vice President Mohammad Reza Rahimi and reviewed an
honor guard before heading in to meetings.

November 27, 2010
By JACK HEALY
BAGHDAD — Prime Minister Nuni Kamal al-Maliki, seeking to show that he is in control of a tenuous new
ruling coalition, said Saturday that he would push ahead to form a new government with or without potential
allies, and that there was no need for American troops to remain in Iraq past a December 2011 deadline for
withdrawal.
In his first news conference since being formally nominated as prime minister two days ago, Mr. Maliki
acknowledged the growing frustration of Iraqis, who have watched their leaders collect salaries of up to $11,000
a month and fly off to their second homes while in much of the country's electricity remains sporadic and
violent attacks continue.
Mr. Maliki's remarks also reflected the splinters that remained inside Iraq's nascent partnership government,
and the competing interests of political groups that have coalesced behind him.
There is no need for American troops to remain in Iraq beyond December 2011, Mr. Maliki said, apparently in a
nod to the followers of the anti-American Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, who have promised to fight any
attempt to maintain an American military presence here.
The Sadrists have played a critical role in supporting Mr. Maliki for a second term after indecisive elections in
March. Some American and Iraqi officials have argued that a residual force is necessary to continue training
Iraqi soldiers and help maintain military equipment, but on Saturday, Mr. Maliki said the Iraqis could stand
alone.
"I don't see a need for any other international forces to help Iraqis control the security situation," he said.
Iraqi officials announced Saturday that they had arrested 12 people who orchestrated a bloody siege against a
Christian church here last month. They called the arrests evidence of improvements in the country's security
forces.
Interior Ministry officials said the insurgents had ties to Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, and had also planned to also
blow up the main gates of the International Zone, where the United States Embassy is located. Officials said
they had seized 6 suicide belts, 10 improvised explosive devices and 5 tons of bomb-making material as a result
of the arrests.

At his news conference, Mr. Maliki, a religious Shiite, said he wanted the new government to include his main
rival, Ayad Allawi, whose Iraqiya coalition won the most support among Iraq's Sunni minority. But Mr. Maliki
indicated he would move forward with or without Mr. Allawi, who has sharply criticized the power-sharing
deal.
"If we reach the critical area and we have to announce the government, we will go on with who is beside us,
who wants to be a partner," Mr. Maliki said.
Mr. Allawi, a secular Shiite and former Iraqi prime minister, has been offered a position leading a new strategic
policy council, but has not said whether he will accept the job.
For Mr. Maliki, the clock is ticking. He now has four weeks to cobble together a government that satisfies most
demands of the country's ethnic, religious and political factions.
He said he had sent letters asking the different coalitions for nominations for key government offices, and
would announce his ministers by Dec. 10 or 15.
Duraid Adnan and Zaid Thaker contributed reporting.

WASHINGTON (AP) - A leading Republican lawmaker is rejecting the Obama administration's assertion that ratification

Kyl of Arizona said Sunday that the Senate has much more urgent business to attend to in the weeks before it breaks for
Christmas. He said the treaty, known as New START, is extremely complex and can wait until the Senate reconvenes
with newly elected members in January. The Obama administration has said ratification is an urgent national security
priority. Kyl said on NBC's "Meet the Press" that delaying a vote would reflect the reality of considering a major treaty in
three weeks amid important domestic issues.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Sen. John McCain said it was time to discuss "regime change" in DPRK, but the former Navy combat
pilot didn't say how he advocates changing the government in the repressive and secretive dictatorship. McCain said he
was not suggesting military action against the North. He said the Chinese, the DPRK's closest ally, should rein in its
neighbor, and he accused Beijing of failing to play a responsible role in either the Korean peninsula, where tensions are
high because of a recent attack by the North, or the world stage. "The key to this, obviously, is China," McCain said on
"State of the Union" on CNN. "And, unfortunately, China is not behaving as a responsible world power. It cannot be in
China's long-term interest to see a renewed conflict on the Korean peninsula." The Arizona Republican added: "They
could bring the North Korean economy to its knees if they wanted to. And I cannot believe that the Chinese should, in a
mature fashion, not find it in their interest to restrain North Korea. So far, they are not." McCain said the Chinese
government's call for emergency talks was a "fine first step," but he questioned whether DPRK would stop its long
history of confrontation without significant penalties. "I think it's time we talked about regime change in North Korea,
and I do not mean military action, but I do believe that this is a very unstable regime," McCain said.

Subject: (Reuters) Saudi king's health "very reassuring" - minister
RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah, who is being treated in New York for a blood clot which complicated a
slipped disc, has started rehabilitation and his health is "very reassuring", the kingdom's health minister said on
November 28. The remarks by Abdullah al-Rabeeah to state television came after the king, who is around 86 or 87,
underwent surgery on his back on November 24 which the royal court said was successful. Prince Nayef, Abdullah's half-
brother and interior minister, said on Saturday the king had been walking after the operation. Pictures by state media
before Abdullah's departure and upon his arrival in New York showed the king sitting in a wheelchair. Abdullah asked
Crown Prince Sultan to run the country in his absence. Sultan, thought to be in his mid-eighties, has had unspecified
health problems in the past two years. The Gulf Arab state controls more than a fifth of the world's crude reserves, is a
vital U.S. ally, a major holder of dollar assets and home to the biggest Arab bourse.

Subject: (AP) Netanyahu wants Israeli troops at Palestinian border
JERUSALEM (AP) - Prime Minister Netanyahu says Israel wants to keep its troops on the eastern border of a future
Palestinian state. Palestinians reject the idea and have proposed an international force along the West Bank's border
with Jordan as part of a peace deal. Netanyahu told U.S. Jewish leaders in a conference call on September 20 that "the
only force that can be relied on to defend the Jewish people is the Israeli Defense Force." Netanyahu says an
international force can't ensure Israel's security. He fears Palestinian militants will attack Israel from within a Palestinian
state if Israeli troops are withdrawn from the West Bank-Jordan border. Palestinian President Abbas maintains that an
Israeli troop presence would infringe upon Palestinian sovereignty.

Subject: (Reuters) Syria rejects U.S. criticism over Lebanon
DAMASCUS (Reuters) — Syria rejected U.S. accusations that it was destabilizing Lebanon and said it did not need U.S.
advice on how to deal with its smaller neighbor. President Bashar al-Assad Assad told al-Hayat newspaper in an
interview published last week that the U.S. "created chaos in every place it entered." Two days later the U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice accused Damascus of joining forces with Iran and the Lebanese Shi'ite
movement Hezbollah to undermine Lebanon.
U.S. Undersecretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Jeffrey Feltman also told the Washington Post there would not
be significant improvement in ties with Syria "as long as Syria's friends are undermining stability in Lebanon", a
reference to Hezbollah.
An official Syrian statement published on Thursday said: "We do not need Feltman's advice because Syria is
exercising its role through an independent decision to serve the interests of its people and the stability and security of
the region."

TEHRAN (AP) - The website of former Iranian President Khatami announced authorities have blocked it without
explanation.
A statement on Khatami.ir said a government committee had decided to filter the website, which on November 4
could only be reached from inside Iran through proxy servers.
While the site was not known to be controversial, Khatami, president from 1997 to 2005, supported opposition leader
Mir Hossein Mousavi in 2009 presidential election that led to re-election of President Ahmadinejad.
Earlier this year authorities banned Khatami from traveling to Japan to attend a conference.

TEL AVIV (AP) - Israel's prime minister says newly leaked U.S. diplomatic cables provide clear proof that the Arab world
agrees with his country's assessment that Iran is the chief danger to the Middle East. Benjamin Netanyahu said on
November 29 "that the greatest threat to peace in the region, if not in the world, has been revealed." According to the
cables released November 28 by Wikileaks, various Arab countries including Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf
states, have used terms like "evil" and "existential threat" to describe Iran. Some urged U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear
facilities. Netanyahu said that if Arab leaders would say in public what they say privately "there might be a
breakthrough."

How the US is Playing/Related News
Ankara Is WikiLeaks Epicenter (Hurriyet)
Turkish media is awash in Wikileaks revelations, with most focused on the 7,918 cables - the largest number for any one
country - emanating from the US Embassy in Ankara. All news channels NW and CNN Turk reported that PM Erdogan,
as he departed for Libya on 11/29, told reporters "let the Wikileaks show what it has and, then, ...we can learn how serious
or unserious these reports are because the credibility of Wikileaks is in question. So, currently we are waiting for them to
print what they have. Then we can make an evaluation and necessary statement." Pro-government Sabah columnist
Mehmet Barlas asks "Are Wikileaks Docs More Striking than Reality?" and opines "It's hard to understand why the State
Department has panicked this much. After all, this information is gathered from the facts, media, and different
sources. What could remain secret in an information age?" Ashi Aydintasbas in Miffiyet Over the past year, the AK Party
government had a volatile relationship with the Obama Administration. The documents show that Americans do not see
the government in Ankara as a real ally, and that they have concerns. Unlike the style used in bilateral meetings, a much
tougher language is used backstage. The fact that the Turkish foreign minister knows his interlocutors characterize him as
'dangerous' at a time he's in Washington will stiffen the distrustfulness between the two capitals." In "Ankara WikiLeaks
Epicenter," mainstream Hurriyefs front page headline report mirrors most Turkish media reports in saying that the
documents show that the US Embassy in Ankara views Turkey "as a country with divisions in leadership" and that "Turkey
cannot be trusted because it was not likely to join the EU and was heading to an Islamist future." Hurriyet spotlights reports
that purportedly say Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan had "incompetent" advisors and was pursuing a secret, Islamist agenda
and that describe him as "stubborn, workaholic and perfectionist," but "not a tyrant." Hurriyet concludes that reports indicated
that that the US views Turkish Foreign Minister Davutoglu as an "exceptionally dangerous" figure and that "America had
been alarmed by his aspirations to reassert the influence the Ottoman Empire used to exert on the region." In "9/11 of
Diplomacy: WikiLeaks Releases 'Secret State Documents," Islamist-oriented Zaman reports that Ankara believes [the high
number of cables from the US Embassy in Ankara] proves Turkey's importance and its diplomatic effectiveness." In "The
WikiLeaks Bomb," pro-government, Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak reports the WikiLeaks releases contain "shocking details"

such as the chief of Mossad, Meir Dagan, telling an American official Islam was on the rise in Turkey, and "asking for how
long the military, the defender of the secular identity, would remain silent." Other media cover the story as follows:
In its two-page spread, Zaman chronicles details of a FM Davutoglu —A/S Gordon meeting from November 12, 2009 in
which the US side asks Turkey to take a tougher position against Iran if Tehran disregards international pressure, as well
as a February 18, 2010 meeting between U/S of State William Burns and Turkish Foreign Ministry U/S Feridun Sinirlioglu
on Iraq.
In "Hell Breaks Loose," mainstream Vatan focuses on the detailed US reports about Prime Minister Erdogan and AK
Party. The paper notes on its centerfold piece that Ergenekon was closely watched by the US and that US officials were
holding talks with Turkish generals. Both the Turkish government and the Turkish army were under close US
surveillance, notes Vatan.
Pro-government Sabah in "Turkey Mark in WikiLeaks Documents," says the State Department has been waiting for the
Wikileaks release with "curiosity and fear." Iran, Azerbaijan and the EU stand on the forefront in documents related to
Turkey, says the paper.
Leftist Taraf in its front page banner headline, "They Monitored Even Erdogan's Son-in-Law," notes "in the documents,
business connections of PM Erdogan's son-in-law were closely watched by the US. It's claimed that Erdogan rules
Turkey with a group of incapable plotters."
Mainstream Aksam in "9/11 of Diplomacy," mentions American diplomats find Davutoglu very dangerous and add that
"Turkey, with its axis shifting to East, is heading to an Islamist state."
Liberal Radikal and most media including the CNN-Turk headline "9/11 of Diplomacy." Radikal highlights "there was a
struggle to prevent Wikileaks from releasing the secret documents but that "the documents that could put the relations

Commentary In Full: "WikiLeaks Crypto will Cause Crisis in Washington"(Milliyet)
Ashi Aydintasbas in Miffiyet: "Three elements might cause damage between Ankara and Washington in the WikiLeaks
revelations related to Turkey. First comes the claim that Turkey has helped al-Qaeda. A high level official believes this
claim will not be convincing, because Ankara has proven itself in fighting against al-Qaeda. We recently see a flurry of
news relating Turkey to al-Qaeda. All Turkish officials I have spoken with believe that such reports had been a campaign
against Turkey which was launched right after the Mavi Marmara crisis. The second claim is the US is helping the
PKK. If the WikiLeaks documents reveal a concrete tie between the US and the PKK, it will rock the two countries, further
damaging the image of the US in Turkey. From time to time, the US has allowed Turkey to launch military operations into
northern Iraq, but actually never really fought against the PKK. As a high level official put it, the US never supported the
PKK but it also did not let the organization be destroyed, and kept it as an element of balance. The sources I have talked
to said the leaks could contain information about the contacts of American officers or intelligence members with the PKK
on security or other issues. Another possibility is contacts between Americans and the PKK's Iran wing, PJAK, but it's a
remote possibility that this issue would be mentioned in diplomatic cables rather than intelligence reports. The third claim
is the expressions used in the US State Department cables to define Turkish leaders. Over the past year, the AK Party
government had a volatile relationship with the Obama Administration. The documents show that Americans do not see
the government in Ankara as a real ally, and that they have concerns. Unlike the style used in bilateral meetings, a much
tougher language is used backstage. The fact that the Turkish foreign minister knows his interlocutors characterize him
as 'dangerous' at a time he's in Washington will stiffen the distrustfulness between the two capitals."

(Haaretz) Netanyahu urges top ministers to extend settlement freeze
PM to convene inner cabinet on Tuesday for vote on a 60-day moratorium in exchange for U.S. guarantees.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will convene his forum of top ministers on Tuesday afternoon to debate extending
Israel's moratorium on construction in West Bank settlements for 60 days.
The concession would be made in exchange for a series of reported U.S. guarantees in Israel's direct peace negotiations
with the Palestinians. Israel halted construction temporarily for 10 months, a freeze that ended on September 26.
The Palestinians have said they would not continue the recently renewed negotiations unless Israel agreed to halt
construction again. The Obama administration has urged Israel to reconsider its refusal of that demand.
If Netanyahu succeeds in convincing the Forum of Seven to accept an extension of the construction freeze, he plans to
bring the matter to the political-security cabinet for a vote later Tuesday.
Defense Minister Ehud Barak (Labor) and Intelligence and Atomic Energy Minister Dan Meridor (Likud) are expected to
support Netanyahu's position, while Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman (Yisrael Beiteinu) is likely to present the
greatest opposition.
Netanyahu is pinning his hopes now on Ministers Benny Begin (Likud), Moshe Ya'alon (Likud) and Eli Yishai (Shas). The
prime minister has already met with Begin over the last few days in an attempt to convince him to change his previously
expressed opposition to extending the freeze.

SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal appeals court on Friday reversed itself and now says the heirs of
Armenians killed in the Turkish Ottoman Empire can seek payment from companies that sold
their relatives life insurance.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said a California law labeling the
killings as a "genocide" does not conflict with U.S. foreign policy, which the court said is
unsettled on the issue.
The ruling was 2-1, the same vote the same judicial panel came to last year when it struck down
the California law empowering the heirs to sue companies that sold life insurance policies to
Armenians killed in Ottoman-era Turkey during World War I.
Last year, the same panel concluded that the U.S. government has sided with the Turkish
goverment and formally taken the position against labeling the killings as a genocide.
Therefore, that panel concluded, California's calling the event a genocide conflicted with U.S.
foreign policy, making the state law invalid.
But in a rare and stunning move on Friday, Judge Dorothy Nelson changed her mind and sided
with Judge Harry Pregerson, which turned his 2009 dissenting view into law.
"We conclude that there is no express federal policy forbidding states to use the term 'Armenian
Genocide," Pregerson wrote.
The ruling revived a lawsuit filed by heirs against three German insurers, including Munich Re
AG.

"This was totally unexpected," said attorney Brian Kabateck, who represents the Armenian
heirs. "It's a great victory for the Armenia people."
Kabateck and other lawyers have filed similar lawsuits against New York Life Insurance Co.
and French insurer AXA, which were settled in 2005 for a combined $37.5 million.
Turkey has long denied that the loss of 1.5 million Armenian lives between 1915 and 1919
constituted genocide and instead describes the deaths as resulting from civil unrest that
accompanied the collapse of the Ottoman Empire.
Judge David Thompson, who wrote the now-overturned majority opinion last year, said in
dissent that former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush defeated congressional
legislation that would have recognized an Armenian genocide. Thompson said those
presidential efforts show the United States has a clear foreign policy against recognizing the
deaths as a genocide.
The majority opinion Friday called those efforts "informal presidential communications" and
not official policy. The court said the insurance companies can file a request for a rehearing.
The companies could also ask the U.S. Supreme Court to consider the case.
Attorney Neil Michael Soltman, who represented the German insurance companies, said an
appeal decision hasn't been made.
Soltman said he was surprised by the decision since no new facts or legal cases were presented
to the appellate panel between its first decision in August 2009 and the court's about face
Friday.
"It's very rare that a panel changes its mind," Soltman said. "Everything is exactly as it was in
August 2009, and all of sudden there's a new opinion. It's hard to explain."

PLEASE PASS TO THE SECRETARY
As has been reported in the press, the Mexican Federal Police arrested Arturo Gallegos Castrellon (known as
Benny), who (according to the Federal Police) confessed to ordering the killing of the three individuals
associated with our consulate in Ciudad Juarez. We believe that "Benny" is the person who ordered these
murders, as well as many of the other high-profile killings in Juarez over the past year.
The relationships among relevant criminal groups in Juarez is complicated: "Benny" headed a gang that
took orders from an armed enforcement group called La Linea that works for the Juarez cartel. I
mentioned in a note some weeks ago that the person who pulled the trigger is under a sealed indictment
in the United States, and we cannot talk about this publicly.
Two key points:
Again, thank you for all you have done personally to sustain the morale of our personnel in Ciudad
Juarez.

Subject: (AP) Egyptians riot, burn cars, claiming vote fraud
ALEXANDRIA (AP) - Protesters set fire to cars, tires and two polling stations, clashing with police firing tear gas in riots
that erupted around Egypt on November 29 over allegations the ruling party carried out widespread fraud to sweep
parliamentary elections.
The country's most powerful opposition movement, the Islamic fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood, acknowledged
that its lawmakers may be all but completely swept out of parliament by what it and other called rampant rigging.
That's a significant blow to the group, which held 88 seats, a fifth, of the outgoing parliament, and it is widely believed
that it was the government goal to drive out its only real rival's lawmakers. The election showed the Brotherhood's
limited options after repeated crackdowns in past years, including the arrest of some 1,400 of its activists in the weeks
ahead of the vote.

Netanyahu supporting the notion of land swaps with the Palestinians. The Feb. 26, 2009 cable, dated two weeks after
Netanyahu was elected, is the first indication of the Israeli leader's position on that concept. The cable says, "Netanyahu
expressed support for the concept of land swaps, and emphasized that he did not want to govern the West Bank and
Gaza but rather to stop attacks from being launched from there."

A resolution on that theme, if approved by the U.N. General Assembly, could contribute to erode the legitimacy of

Amorim said the BRIC group, which includes Brazil, Russia, India and China, discussed the proposed resolution during

achieve peace for your people, and for the entire region."
Abbas and other senior Palestinian negotiators have threatened to quit the U.S.-backed negotiations if Israel should
resume construction in West Bank settlements. Last November, Netanyahu declared a 10-month moratorium on
construction in settlements, but the freeze is set to expire at the end of this month, and it is not yet clear whether it will
be renewed.
"Even if things don't appear perfect," Peres told Abbas, "the path toward peace and an independent Palestinian state is
certainly preferable to an ongoing conflict and bloodshed. Even if there will be crises and disagreements, and the road
will seem imperfect, I'm sure that new and creative solutions can be achieved."
Abbas replied that "we're serious and our goal is to achieve a peace agreement as soon as possible." To this Peres
responded saying "I'm sure Netanyahu is a trustworthy partner."
Earlier, Abbas spoke with Netanyahu by phone. The two leaders offered mutual greetings for the holidays, the Muslim
Eid el Fitr and Jewish Rosh Hashanah.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A planned Israeli-Palestinian summit due to be held in Paris by the end of the month has been
rescheduled, the Israeli prime minister's office said on October 16, a sign of increased strain over stalled peace
talks. French President Sarkozy invited Prime Minister Netanyahu, Palestinian President Abbas and Egyptian President
Mubarak to meet before the end of October, although an exact date for the summit had not been set. "Following joint
consultations it has been agreed to set a new date for the preparatory meeting," a statement from Netanyahu's office
said, adding there was no chance of holding it on Oct 21, which was previously thought to be possible. "We are looking
for a new date that works for everybody, although there is nothing firm scheduled yet," an Israeli government official
told Reuters.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Vice President Biden arrived in Iraq on August 30 as U.S. troops prepared to end combat
operations on August 31.
Biden was expected to hold talks with Iraqi leaders during a period of political deadlock, almost six months after an
inconclusive election in March, over forming the country's next government.
His visit comes at a time when Iraq is on high alert for attacks by insurgents after a series of bombings that killed
dozens of people and underscored the fragility of Iraq's recent security gains.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates donated S42 million to the Palestinian Authority, boosting support

said on September 10. An Arab source in Washington said the donation, which was confirmed by a Palestinian
government spokesman, was made after repeated calls by senior U.S. officials for more Arab support to help build
Palestinian government capacity. "It is a timely gesture of support both for the talks and the institution-building project
of the PA, as well as a response to the public urging from President Obama and Secretary Clinton," the source said.
Palestinian government spokesman Ghassan al-Khatib confirmed the UAE donation but declined to give further details.

Subject: (AP) American visits Iran blast site under freedom deal
TEHRAN (AP) — An Iranian-American businessman freed after more than two years in Tehran's main prison visited
survivors of a deadly 2008 mosque bombing as a condition of his release in a scripted event that could carry propaganda
value at home. Iranian authorities did not immediately explain their demand for 71-year-old Reza Taghavi to pay homage
in the southern city of Shiraz and personally acknowledge an attack in which he denies having any connection. But it
would fit neatly into possible Iranian attempts to squeeze multiple messages from Taghavi's October 16 release after 29
months in custody. Taghavi, accompanied by his wife and lawyer, fulfilled his pledge to visit the site of the mosque
bombing. They later met with survivors, including people who lost relatives in the attack.
The U.S. and allies fear Iran could use its nuclear fuel labs to eventually produce weapons-grade material. Iran says it
only seeks peaceful energy-producing reactors. Taghavi's attorney, former U.S. diplomat Pierre Prosper, said he
purposely left American officials out of the negotiations to avoid having his client become a bargaining chip. "Our strategy
was to make sure that our dialogue with the [Iranian] government was between us and them," said Prosper, who held five
rounds of direct talks with Iranian envoys since Taghavi was jailed.

You asked about this. It was Walter Isaacson.
New BBG chief wants more money to combat "enemies" such as China and Russia Posted By Josh Rogin Tuesday,
October 5, 2010 - 4:43 PM
The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) has a new chairman in Walter Isaacson, and the former CNN and Time
magazine chief is calling for even more money for the BBG to combat the public diplomacy efforts of America's
"enemies," which he identifies as Iran, Venezuela, Russia, and China.
The BBG, which oversees a $700 million annual budget to run such organizations as the Voice of America, Radio Free
Europe, and Radio Free Asia, funds breakthrough reporting in some of the most dangerous parts of the world, but at the
same time is facing increased competition from other governments' forays into international broadcasting.
Isaacson said that other countries are stepping up their international broadcasting efforts and that the Congress must
allow the U.S. government to do the same.
"We can't allow ourselves to be out-communicated by our enemies," he said. "You've got Russia Today, Iran's Press TV,
Venezuela's TeleSUR, and of course, China is launching an international broadcasting 24-hour news channel with
correspondents around the world [and has] reportedly set aside six to ten billion [dollars] -- we've to go to Capitol Hill
with that number -- to expand their overseas media operations."
Isaacson said that combating internet censorship would be a major focus of the BBG under his leadership and that China
and Iran were the prime targets.
"China, Iran, and other countries block democratic impulses using their later technologies, and Beijing has deployed
armies of cyber militias to go after their country's cyber dissidents," he said. "The BBG is at the forefront of combating
this. Through constant innovation and technical evolution, our engineers are opening up the Internet gateway for
audiences in China and Iran."
"We know where we stand in the fight for Internet freedom," Isaacson said. "Wherever there is a firewall, it's our duty
to storm it, to denounce it and to circumvent it."
Isaacson was speaking at last week's 60th anniversary celebration for Radio Free Europe, which he credited as
contributing to the end of the Cold War. He made it clear the BBG's outlets will stick to reporting the news objectively,
even if that conflicts with the foreign policy of the Obama administration.
"It's sometimes said that our international broadcasting is in a difficult position because by law and by tradition it's
tasked with two separate missions that might conflict: first of all, covering the news with the highest journalistic
standards and secondly, being a part of America's public diplomacy by accurately conveying its policies and values to the
world," Isaacson said.
"Let me say to you, my fellow journalists, that I will stress and we will stress the primacy of the first of these missions,
our mission of being credible journalists, because in fact, it's the only way to carry out the second mission. You can't do
it unless you're credible and telling the truth, and in the end, the truth is on our side."
Pressed by The Cable to explain exactly what that means, especially in light of reports that the Obama administration
sought to influence BBG reporting after the disputed Iranian presidential elections, Isaacson promised he wouldn't
hesitate to air views that contradict American foreign policy on BBG stations.
He said that the goals of American foreign policy and the objectives of credible journalism overlap about 90 percent of
the time -- as for the other 10 percent, a choice must be made.
"I feel it's the role of the BBG to always make the choice on the side of credible journalism, just as you would in the
private sector," Isaacson said. "We can never compromise our credibility. And in doing so, that will probably help further
the foreign policy interests of the United States. But if it's ever a real conflict, our goal one is to protect our credibility."

RAMALLAH (AP) — Palestinian President Abbas said the Palestinians are willing to end all historic claims against Israel
once they get their state as part of a peace deal. An end-of-claims declaration is a long-standing Israeli demand, and
Abbas addressed the issue in an interview with Israel TV on October 17. Abbas said negotiating with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remains his preferred choice, but that he cannot return to talks unless settlement expansion
stops. Abbas said other options remain on the table, including seeking UN recognition of a Palestinian state. He said
resignation is not an option for now.

States and its ally, South Korea. Washington replied that it would not enter a "war of words" with the North.

Subject: (AP) Israeli PM: Current settlement curbs won't remain
JERUSALEM (AP) - Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said the current restrictions on West Bank settlements will not
remain in place, however there will still be some limits on construction.
Israel's 10-month slowdown on new housing starts in West Bank settlements expires at the end of this month and is a
key point of contention in newly launched peace talks with Palestinians.
Netanyahu told Mideast envoy Tony Blair the Palestinians want a total freeze in construction. "That will not happen,"
he said.
Israel will not build "tens of thousands of housing units that are in the pipeline, but we will not freeze the lives of the
residents" of the settlements, Netanyahu said.

(The Detroit News) - A burned Quran was found at a mosque in East Lansing September 11, prompting the Michigan
chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-MI) to ask the FBI to investigate.
CAIR-MI reports that officials of the Islamic Center of East Lansing say vandals left a burned Quran at the front entrance
of the mosque and scatted pages in the street nearby.
"The perpetrators of this unconscionable act of religious intimidation must be apprehended and prosecuted to the full
extent of state and federal law," CAIR-MI Executive Director Dawud Walid, said in a statement.
Torn pages of the Quran appeared to be smeared with feces, CAIR officials said.
A spokesman for the FBI could not immediately be reached for comment.
A Florida pastor's plan to burn a Quran on Saturday, the ninth anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, resulted in
worldwide condemnation and protests. Pastor Terry Jones of Gainesville, Fla., later abandoned his plan.

Subject: (Reuters) Netanyahu seeks loyalty oath to Jewish nation-state
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will push for legislation to require those wanting to become
Israeli citizens to pledge loyalty to the "nation-state of the Jewish people." Under Israeli law, Jews wanting to immigrate
to Israel are granted automatic citizenship and non-Jews have to take a loyalty oath to the "state of Israel".
The amendment would win favor with one of Netanyahu's key coalition partners, Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman,
who leads the right-wing Israel our Home party. Lieberman has advocated a loyalty oath to the Jewish state for all
Israelis, including Arab citizens who make up some 20 percent of the population.

DAMASCUS (Reuters) - Western efforts to renew peace talks between Syria and Israel are focusing on finding common
ground, but nothing has crystallized yet and the chances of success are unknown, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said.
In his first public assessment of U.S. and French moves to relaunch the talks, Assad told Turkey's TRT television that
envoys from the two countries are trying to accommodate Syria's demands for the return of the Golan Heights and
Israel's security objectives.
Assad said that if the talks were to resume they would be initially indirect, similar to the last four rounds that were
mediated by Turkey and broke off in 2008 without a deal.

(Hareetz) Labor party ministers angered by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's snap decision to back a
controversial citizenship loyalty oath said late October 6 that they expected a new freeze in settlement
building as a payoff. Netanyahu neglected to inform his Labor coalition partners that he had approved a
right-wing minister's draft of a new oath that would require anyone taking Israeli citizenship to swear
allegiance to Israel as a "Jewish and democratic state."
The move paves the way for a vote in the Knesset and was hailed as victory by ultra-nationalist Foreign
Minister Avigdor Lieberman's Israel our Home party, Netanyahu's major coalition partner. But the prime
minister must perform a balancing act. Allies at both ends of the political spectrum and the Labor party
hope that his latest concession is a sop to right-wingers ahead of a decision to renew a ban on settlement
building in the West Bank - a key demand of the left.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders meeting in Brussels on September 16 will call on Israel to extend a

European Union deems it indispensable that both parties observe calm and restraint and refrain from actions that could
affect negatively the progress of the negotiation," reads the draft, referring to direct Israeli-Palestinian peace talks that
began this month. "In this regard, it recalls that settlements are illegal under international law and, with a view to
ensure that these talks continue in a constructive manner, calls for an extension of the moratorium decided by Israel."

A Hamas official said Hathem Qufishe was arrested early October 18 at his home in the city of Hebron. The official,
Mushir al-Masri, said Israel is trying to "quash the legitimate representatives" of the Palestinian people.
The Israeli military had no comment on the arrest.
Qufishe was recently released from an Israeli prison after more than three years. He was among dozens of Hamas
officials arrested after Hamas-affiliated militants captured Israeli soldier Sgt. Gilad Schalit in June 2006.

JERUSALEM (AP) - An aide to Israel's president says the king of Morocco won't meet with the Israeli statesman because
of the impasse in Mideast peace talks.
The aide says King Mohammed VI cited the deadlocked talks in turning down President Shimon Peres' request to meet
at an upcoming international conference in Marrakech.
Peace talks have stalled over Israel's refusal to extend building curbs in the West Bank. The Palestinians say they won't
negotiate if Israel doesn't relent, but have given the U.S. until early November to try to resolve the dispute.
The aide, who wasn't authorized to discuss the issue with the media and spoke on condition of anonymity, said
October 18 that if Peres can't meet with the king, he won't attend the World Economic Forum on the Middle East and
North Africa.

General Jim Jones has spent a lifetime serving our country with honor and distinction. In war and in peace, from foreign
battlefields to the highest levels of our government, he has exemplified the best traditions of the Marine Corps and the
United States. I have been honored to serve with him and to call him my friend. As National Security Advisor he brought
a steady hand and clear vision to an unforgiving agenda. His leadership was crucial in winding down the combat mission
in Iraq, refocusing the war in Afghanistan, and advancing our nation's interests and values around the world. America is
more secure and the world is more stable because of Jim's tireless efforts. He will be sorely missed, but I am pleased
that Jim will now be able to spend more time with his wife Diane and their wonderful family.
General Jones leaves Marine-sized shoes to fill, but we are fortunate that a public servant as talented and dedicated as
Tom Donilon has agreed to take on the task. I have known Tom for many years and he brings deep experience and
valuable skills to this crucial job. He has a proven ability to translate big-picture vision into concrete action. As Deputy
National Security Advisor, Tom has been a trusted member of our team and has contributed to every major policy
decision. I appreciate his support for the State Department and our diplomacy and development efforts around the
world and I look forward to working closely with him to implement the President's agenda.

IRAQ BURIN (AP) - Palestinians say extremist Jews damaged their olive trees close to a West Bank village as the yearly
harvest of the important crop begins. Resident Bilal Eid said that two dozen men from a nearby Jewish settlement tore
at about a dozen trees after trying to attack Palestinians bulldozing an access road to their fields. The attack came at the
beginning of the 40-day Palestinian olive harvest. It's traditionally a time of heightened violence, as a minority of
extremist Jews try to provoke Palestinians. Eid said the damage could kill the trees, which were meant to be harvested
this week, near the village of Burin. A military spokeswoman said Israeli forces ordered the Jewish intruders to leave.

KABUL (Reuters) - The commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, General David Petraeus, has ordered a probe
into the death of a British aid worker killed during a rescue bid by U.S. forces, the U.S. military said. "Initial reports
indicated the explosion was caused by a detonation triggered by one of the captors who was in close proximity to Linda
Norgrove. Subsequent review of surveillance footage and discussions with members of the rescue team do not
conclusively determine the cause of her death," it said. The statement comes shortly after British Prime Minister David
Cameron told a news conference Norgrove may have been killed by a grenade from foreign forces during the rescue
operation.

DUBAI/PARIS (Reuters) - Al Qaeda's north African arm wants a repeal of a ban on the Muslim face veil in France, the
release of militants and 7 million Euros in exchange for freeing hostages who include five French, Al Arabiya TV said. Al
Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) is holding seven foreigners in the Sahara desert after kidnapping them last
month. "The abductors have unrealistic demands which Mali and France could not accept... including withdrawing a ban
on the face veil in France and the release of some of the group's elements detained in France, Mauritania and other
countries," the television quoted unnamed sources as saying. The sources did not specify which militants the hostage-
takers wanted released. France's Foreign Ministry dismissed the report as one of several "rumors" since the kidnappings
in mid-September.

Subject: (Reuters) Kosovo-Serbia talks likely delayed to March
PRISTINA (Reuters) - European Union-mediated talks between Belgrade and Pristina will begin only after a new Kosovo
government takes power following elections in February, Kosovo's acting president said. Last month Serbia, which does
not recognize Kosovo's independence, agreed to hold talks with Pristina after it was told its hardline stance on its former
province could halt progress to the EU. In an interview, acting President Jakup Krasniqi said it would be difficult to start
talks during a political crisis that followed President Fatmir Sejdiju's resignation last month. "The first half of February is
the optimal time to hold early elections," he told Reuters. "The end of March is the period when Kosovo will have its
own institutions and then it can have talks with Serbia." Krasniqi said he will announce the date of early elections a day
or two after U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visits Pristina. Kosovo had scheduled elections for November 2011,
but Sejdiju's resignation hurt relations between the two main coalition partners: the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK)
and Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK). Krasniqi said early elections could postpone the sale of Telekom, which is
expected to bring between 300 million - 600 million euros. Whether the government can secure a parliamentary
majority for necessary legislation to sell Telekom is uncertain, he said. "This is complicated at this point," he said.

WASHINGTON (AP) - The White House said President Obama and British Prime Minister Cameron agree their nations

Afghanistan.
The White House said President Obama called Cameron to offer condolences. Officials said Obama and Cameron both
agreed the rescue operation was necessary and it was essential to "get to the bottom" of what happened in the rescue
attempt.

and Latin American seats were uncontested so South Africa, India and Colombia easily won on Tuesday's first ballot in

received 122 and Canada 114.

RAHAT (AP) — Israeli police said they demolished an illegally built mosque in the southern Bedouin city of Rahat, touching
off rock-throwing protests by residents. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the two-story mosque was knocked
down November 7 in keeping with a court ruling. Mosque activist Yousef Abu-Jama said residents built the structure
illegally because Israeli authorities would take too long to issue approval. Authorities rarely target mosques for demolition.
This particular mosque was financed by a group that is frequently in conflict with authorities.

Premier meets U.S. Vice President on sidelines of
Jewish GA, warns that sanctions have not been
enough against Iran.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told U.S. Vice President Joe Biden during their meeting in New
Orleans on Sunday that Israel had made enough efforts to reach a peace settlement with the Palestinians,
and has not received sufficient gestures in return.
Speaking to the vice president before the latter's address to the General Assembly of Jewish Federations,
Netanyahu said that a peace agreement could not be reached from above and added that the Palestinians
must be stopped from taking unilateral action at the United Nations in their quest to establish a state.
Netanyahu also told Biden that other Arab states must be brought into the peace process to give Israel
the political backing needed.
An Israeli political source said earlier Sunday that Netanyahu would tell Biden that the U.S. must create a
credible threat in the form of a military campaign to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
According to the official in Jerusalem, Netanyahu planned to stress that the West must operate with
suspicion and great caution in the face of Iran's recently stated intentions to renew dialogue over its
nuclear program.
The source also said that Netanyahu would warn Biden that the international community must be careful
not to fall into any sort of Iranian trap with regard to this expressed willingness, said the official.
The prime minister was expected to say that a credible threat of military action is the only way to ensure
that Iran will rethink its nuclear program, according to the Jerusalem official. Although Netanyahu believes
that the harsh military sanctions have weakened Iran, said the official, there is still no sign that they have
led the Islamic Republic to consider halting its nuclear program.

"The only way to ensure that Iran will not go nuclear is to create a credible threat of military action
against it if it doesn't cease its race for a nuclear weapon," the source said Netanyahu would tell Biden.
"The economic sanctions are making it difficult for Iran, but there is no sign that the Ayatollah regime
plans to stop its nuclear program because of them," the source said Netanyahu would add.
Netanyahu was also say that the only time Iran stopped its nuclear program was in 2003, when it believed
there was a threat of American military action, the source said, adding that the threat alone is enough to
prevent the need for military action.
Netanyahu arrived earlier Sunday in the U.S., where he was also set to meet Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton and address the General Assembly of Jewish Federations in New Orleans.
Asked about the comments, an Israeli official traveling with Netanyahu said the prime minister call in all
his meetings in the United States for pressure to be stepped up against Iran. He is also expected to
discuss with U.S. officials Israel's impasse in direct negotiations with the Palestinians.
"It is our fervent desire that the current impasse can be overcome and we see an expeditious return to
direct talks with the Palestinians," Netanyahu spokesman Mark Regev said on board the prime minister's
flight from Tel Aviv to New Orleans.
Netanyahu will meet Biden before the latter's own address to the GA. Netanyahu will deliver his speech to
the forum on Monday, before his four-day visit to New York.
During the trip, he will not see President Barack Obama, who is on a visit to Asia. But the U.S. visit will
give Netanyahu an opportunity to gauge the impact of last week's Republican rout of Obama's Democrats
in the midterm congressional elections.
Netanyahu was scheduled to hold talks in New York with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on Monday
and Clinton on Thursday, before flying home.

BEIRUT (AP) - The leader of Hezbollah says his militant group will "cut the hand" of anyone who tries to arrest any
member of the party. Sheik Hassan Nasrallah said in a speech the group will not accept any accusation against any of its
fighters or leaders in the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. He said the group would defend itself
anyway it chooses. He did not elaborate.

DEAUVILLE (Reuters) - Russia wants to take part in a NATO-backed missile defense shield and will go to next month's
NATO summit, softening its stance after reassurances from France and Germany, a source close to participants said on
October 19.
Security is a major stumbling block in Russia's relationship with the West and has dominated talks between Presidents
Sarkozy and Medvedev and Chancellor Merkel in the northern French seaside town of Deauville.
The source said that Medvedev himself would attend the NATO summit, which is due to unveil a new strategic plan
for the 28-country alliance on November 19-20 in Lisbon.

Subject: (AP) Indian report: Pakistan spies tied to Mumbai siege
NEW DELHI (AP) - A U.S. citizen convicted of scouting locations for the 2008 Mumbai attack said Pakistan's spy agency
was deeply involved in the planning of the assault.
David Headley told Indian interrogators that officers from Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency gave him
$25,000 to fund his scouting missions to Mumbai ahead of the attack.
He said he debriefed his ISI handler every time he returned to Pakistan from Mumbai. He said his handler also made
suggestions about how best to carry out the attack.
The revelations were contained in the Indian government's report on its June interrogation of Headley. The report,
marked secret, was obtained by The Associated Press.
The Mumbai attacks killed 166 people.

TEHRAN (AP) - Venezuelan President Chavez has arrived in Tehran for talks with Iranian leaders expected to focus on
efforts to boost cooperation between the allies oil, gas and petrochemical industries.
Iranian state television says Chavez was greeted by Industry Minister Ali Akbar Mehrabian at Tehran's Mehrabad
airport upon arrival early October 19.
State TV says Chavez will hold talks with President Ahmadinejad, during his two-day visit.
The Venezuelan leader backed Iran in its confrontation with the West over Tehran's disputed nuclear program. The
U.S. accuses Iran of seeking to develop an atomic bomb. Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.

JERUSALEM (AP) - Diplomatic sources said the United States offered Israel an incentive package to reinstate
a moratorium on West Bank settlement building in an effort to revive stalled peace talks with the
Palestinians. Under the deal, Israel would stop settlement construction for 90 days in the West Bank, but not in
east Jerusalem. Among the incentives, the United States would fight resolutions critical of Israel at the United
Nations.

GAZA (Reuters) - Israel carried out a series of air strikes in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian Authority officials and
witnesses said, after militants from the Hamas-ruled territory fired rockets into southern Israel. No one was
reported killed in any of the attacks. The Israeli strikes targeted a Hamas training camp, where two gunmen
were wounded, smuggling tunnels along Gaza's border with Egypt, and other, unpopulated areas, Hamas
officials and witnesses said. An Israeli military spokeswoman, who was checking that report, said 13 rockets
were fired from Gaza into Israel in the past two days. None of the attacks caused any injuries. Hamas leaders
have tried to curb rocket fire at Israel, but smaller groups continue to carry out such attacks. Israel's military
said more than 200 cross-border missiles, rockets and mortars have been fired from Gaza this year. An air strike
in Gaza on December 18 killed five militants from a rocket launching squad.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The Republic of Korea (ROK) army said it will hold its largest-ever live-fire drill near the
military border with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on December 23 in a show of force in the wake
of Pyongyang's attack on one of its islands last month. The drill, involving artillery, fighter jets and the largest
number of personnel in a peace-time exercise, comes after the ROK's live-fire artillery exercise on December
20 on the island near the tensely guarded sea border and is likely to infuriate Pyongyang. It will take place on
the ROK mainland.

BETHLEHEM (Reuters) - A Palestinian Authority draft resolution condemning Israel's West Bank settlement
activity is ready to be presented to the UNSC, a senior Palestinian Authority official said. Saeb Erekat, the chief
Palestinian Authority negotiator in peace talks with Israel, said he expected the resolution would be put to a
UNSC vote in February, after the United States ends its presidency of the council. "We are not condemning
Israel. We are condemning settlement activities and we hope the resolution will pass," Erekat said. He said 15
nations had helped draft the proposal after Palestinian Authority President Abbas requested a UNSC meeting to
discuss settlement building in November. "Something must be done on the international level to halt the
settlement expansion which the Israeli government is undertaking in the West Bank, including Jerusalem,"
Nabil Abu Rdainah, Abbas's spokesman, said at the time. As the Palestinian Authority has only observer status
at the UN, the resolution will be presented by a full member of the council. Erekat said he hoped the United
States would not use its veto to defeat the resolution and added that if it did not succeed at the UNSC, "we will
go to the International Court of Justice."

human rights, territory and sovereignty." A Foreign Ministry official later confirmed that Bolivia sent a letter to
Palestinian Authority President Abbas declaring its support. She spoke on condition of anonymity because she
is not authorized to talk to the news media. Bolivia joins the governments of Argentina, Cuba, Brazil and
Venezuela in supporting a sovereign state of Palestine with borders recognized prior to the 1967 Mideast war.

device often used in insurgent attacks blew up his vehicle, said police spokesman Colonel Abdul Ghafour. Like many
Afghans, the official had only one name. "The district governor has been martyred. Three other people, his driver and
guards have been injured," Ghafour told AFP. He could not say who was behind the attack, but the tactics were typical
of the Taliban.

JERUSALEM (AP) - Israeli leaders are criticizing former President Clinton's comment that Russian immigrants in Israel an
obstacle to peace. Clinton noted the most recent arrivals in Israel have the hardest time agreeing to share the land with
the Palestinians. He also said residents who have been in Israel the longest and have more of a historical perspective and
are most supportive of peace in Israel. Among the Israel leaders criticizing Clinton's comments is Foreign Minister
Lieberman, whose political party relies heavily on immigrant support. He called the remarks "crude generalizations" and
interference in Israel's internal affairs.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. congressional panel, in a move likely to increase trade tensions with China, approved a
bill that allows the United States to slap duties on goods from countries with fundamentally undervalued currencies.
The House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee backed the legislation on a voice vote, clearing the way
for the full House to take up the measure next week. It may never become law, however, as it faces an uncertain future
in the Senate.

TEL AVIV (AP) — A senior Israeli intelligence official says llamas has rockets with a range of 50 miles, putting the coastal
metropolis of Tel Aviv within range of its launchers. The official blames Egypt, saying it is not doing enough to stem
smuggling through a network of tunnels along the relatively short border between its Sinai desert and the Gaza
Strip. The official said most of the tunnels were concentrated in an area no longer than 2.5 miles. "Egypt can stop all
this smuggling of weapons within 24 hours if they want to do it," the official said November 14, speaking on condition of
anonymity under Israeli security regulations. The official said, however, that intelligence cooperation with Egypt was
otherwise effective.

HONOLULU (Reuters) - President Obama took the rare step on December 29 of temporarily appointing U.S. ambassadors
to Syria, Turkey and Azerbaijan, restoring a top U.S. envoy to Damascus after an absence of nearly six years.
The White House announced Obama would make "recess appointments" of Robert Stephen Ford as ambassador to
Syria, Francis "Frank" Ricciardone as ambassador to Turkey and Matthew Bryza as ambassador to Azerbaijan. Obama,
who is on holiday in Hawaii, also named Norman Eisen to be ambassador to the Czech Republic. Eisen had worked as an
assistant to Obama on ethics and government reform since the beginning of the president's term in January 2009.
A Senate source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the recess appointments for the three ambassadors were
likely to last for a year.

MOSCOW (AP) - A judge sentenced jailed Russian oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky to 14 years in prison
following a trial seen as payback for his defiance of Vladimir Putin's power. Judge Viktor Danilkin handed
down the sentence after convicting Khodorkovsky of stealing oil from his own company and laundering the
proceeds. Khodorkovsky is in the final year of an eight-year prison sentence. His lawyers say the new sentence
is counted from his 2003 arrest and includes his previous term in jail.

JERUSALEM (AP) - An Israeli lawmaker says Jewish settlers have hauled construction equipment into a settlement deep
inside the West Bank in preparation for the end of a construction moratorium. The end of the settlement slowdown
presents the first major crisis in Mideast peace talks launched early this month in Washington. Israeli Prime Minister
Netanyahu, who imposed the slowdown 10 months ago as a peace gesture, says he will not extend the restrictions. But
the Palestinians say they will not continue negotiations if building resumes. The U.S. is trying to broker a
compromise. Pro-settler lawmaker Danny Danon said on September 25 that activists plan to lay the cornerstone of a
new neighborhood in the Revava settlement September 26, the last day of the slowdown. He said further construction
is planned September 27.

legislators, party activists and about 3.5 million labor union members. Three other candidates also competed in the

removed from office after 13 years by the Conservative Party-led coalition government.

freeze on new settlement construction in the West Bank. However, he made clear that Israel would have to cease all
settlement activities if the direct negotiations with Israel are to succeed. "Israel must choose between peace and the
continuation of settlements," he said. Abbas has repeatedly threatened to break off the fragile negotiations with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the settlements.

Battisti should be extradited on murder convictions from the 1970s in Italy, but it left the final decision to Lula.
The move, announced in a statement released by the Brazilian government, was widely expected and comes a
day after Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi warned that such a decision would be "incomprehensible and
unacceptable." Brazilian media reported any decision still had to be verified by the Supreme Court but it was
not immediately clear whether this was just a formality.

Subject: (Reuters) Afghans say two students killed by NATO troops
KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan officials accused NATO-led troops of killing two school boys in central Afghanistan on October
23 after a patrol came under fire by Taliban insurgents, but foreign troops said the circumstances were unclear.
A statement released by the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) said two civilians had possibly
been killed in the Maidan Shahr district of Wardak province, west of Kabul, when insurgents attacked the patrol.
"During the attack, three Afghan citizens on a motorcycle entered the engagement area. Two of them fell off the
vehicle and were taken away by local villagers," ISAF said.
It said their condition could not be determined before they were taken away. The incident was under investigation,
ISAF said.
However, a spokesman for the Wardak governor said ISAF troops had fired indiscriminately and killed two students
about 30 miles west of Kabul when a rocket was fired at their convoy. He said the rocket was apparently fired by the
Taliban.
Wardak police chief Nawas Haqyar said ISAF troops were returning fire and mistakenly killed the students. The attack
prompted a brief demonstration by angry villagers, demanding an explanation from NATO forces over the killing.

BAGHDAD (AP) - Iraq's prime minister is accusing WikiLeaks of releasing documents that detail prisoner abuse by Iraqi
security forces to sabotage his re-election hopes.
A statement released October 23 by Prime Minister Nouni al-Maliki's office said the timing of the documents' release
raises questions about whether it was motivated by politics.
The statement said the documents show no proof of any improper treatment of detainees while al-Maliki has been at
the helm of the Iraqi government.
It said he has taken a tough stance against terrorists but offered no details.

REVAVA (AP) - Dozens of Jewish settlers broke ground on a new daycare center deep inside the West Bank to celebrate
the end of the government's 10-month-old construction slowdown at midnight- symbolically renewing settlement
activity that threatens to derail peace talks with the Palestinians. Some 2000 people headed to another nearby
settlement for a larger rally, where activists released 2000 blue and white balloons- the colors of the Israeli flag- into the
air at sundown. The balloons were meant to symbolize the 2000 apartments that settlers say they are ready to be built
immediately. The festivities went ahead despite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's call for the settlers to
show "restraint" as the curbs are lifted.

After the arrest, other residents started throwing rocks at the police forces. One policeman was hit in the head with a
rock and was injured. He was treated on the scene. The police fired two warning shots into the air and the crowd
dispersed.
In a separate incident also on September 26, a molotov cocktail was thrown at police and border patrol forces on patrol
in the Givati parking lot near the entrance to Silwan and the City of David. The molotov cocktail exploded but there were
no injuries.
A sweep of the area by border patrol found three other molotov cocktails and three suspects were arrested.

medical officials said they had recovered three bodies from the site of an explosion that occurred after darkness fell
outside Bureij refugee camp, near the Israel-Gaza frontier. Hamas television reports said the blast had been caused
either by an Israeli air strike or cross-border tank fire.

(Haaretz) - The Palestinian leadership plans to meet October 2 and is expected to officially decide to end
negotiations with Israel if the renewed West Bank settlement construction is not halted. Those expected
to attend the meeting include representatives of the PLO workers committee, the Fatah central committee,
and the heads of other political parties. After making a decision, the Palestinian leadership is expected to
announce that the final decision of whether to leave the talks will be made by the Arab League, who are
planning to discuss the issue October 4. The head of the Palestinian negotiation team, Saeb Erekat, said
"there are no half-way solutions on the settlements issue." In a statement released to the press after
meeting with U.S. Consul General Daniel Rubinstein, Erekat called on the American government and the
European Union to force Israel to stop all construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, in order to
give peace a chance. Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit said the Palestinians would not be
able to remain in the peace talks after Israel's decision not to extend the moratorium. Gheit added that
"despite the international efforts, I am not optimistic [about peace talks]".

This is a very thoughtful piece that identifies many of the same factors we are in our diplomatic chapter (and that is not
just because the author – the former Bangladesh ambassador to the US—cites me). What is most striking is that it
affirms that our analysis in the QDDR offers a set of questions that foreign ministries all over the world are grappling
with. I had hoped to have time to do some traveling to broadcast the QDDR to key allies and partners around the world
after the QDDR is in, but even if that can't happen, we will devise an outreach strategy re sending the report out to
foreign ministers around the world and to our ambassadors that will greatly amplify its impact. AM

Subject: (AP) Cholera fears spark anti-clinic protest in Haiti
PORT-AU-PRINCE (AP) - Protesters attacked a cholera treatment center as it was preparing to open in the city of St.
Marc, highlighting the fear surrounding a disease that was almost unknown in Haiti before it began spreading through
the countryside, aid workers said. Some of the roughly 300 students and other protesters said they feared the Doctors
Without Borders-Spain clinic would bring more of the disease to their seaside town, which is one of the hardest hit in
the week-old epidemic that has killed 284 people and infected 3,769, according to United Nations figures. Witnesses
said the protesters threw rocks and at least one Molotov cocktail. UN peacekeepers from Argentina arrived with riot
shields to reinforce police. Warning shots were heard; the UN said its soldiers fired blanks. There were no reports of
injuries. Haitian health officials assured the crowd the clinic would not open in that neighborhood. The 400-bed facility
was intended to rehydrate and treat people with the severe diarrheal disease. Doctors Without Borders-Spain country
chief Francisco Otero said the group consulted with local authorities and told them the clinic is important for stemming
the spread of cholera. He said they would try to reopen it in another part of St. Marc.

GUADALAJARA (AP) - Public safety officials in Mexico said gunmen ambushed a convoy of 20 police officers, killing nine
of them and leaving one missing. The officials in Jalisco state said ten officers who survived the attack fought an hours-
long battle with the unknown attackers, and several gunmen were wounded. The attackers, who were riding in about
ten sport utility vehicles, were armed with grenades and assault rifles. They fled into neighboring Michoacan state after
the attack. Michoacan is the home to a violent cartel known to launch fierce attacks on police convoys.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Talks to avert a public sector strike next week which could cripple Israel's ports and airports have
been suspended and will resume after the weekend, Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz said on October 29. The Histadrut
labor union wants a 10.5 percent pay rise over three years for the 700,000 public sector workers it represents, but the
Finance Ministry has offered 1.5 percent. Talks will resume on October 31, the first day of the Israeli working
week. "The gaps are still large but at least we have been able to outline (our differences). I think there is no cause for a
strike, it will harm everybody -- citizens, the economy and the workers themselves," Steinitz told reporters. Unions have
indicated they may call a strike as early as November 2, which could shut down public transport, government offices and
some government-owned companies. Health services and utilities would function at reduced capacity. An official with
Histadrut, which represents public sector staff, said the pay rise sought by union leaders was justified. "We are looking
to reach a decision and gain a realistic wage rise for the workers. This is the heart of the negotiations," Avi Nisan-Koren
told reporters.

GAZA (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of supporters of the militant Islamic Jihad movement rallied in the streets of Gaza on
October 29, chanting "Death to America" and "Death to Israel." Young men and boys wearing white T-shirts with a
slogan in the shape of a rifle bore portraits of militants killed in combat, under the black flags of Islamic Jihad. Ramadan
Sheilah, the group's exiled chief in Damascus, sent a recorded message marking the anniversary of the assassination of
the group's leader Fathi Shiqaqi in Malta in 1995, by presumed Israeli secret agents. "Israel will not bring peace to the
region, it will only bring war and destruction and therefore, the slogan of all should be that Israel must be wiped out of
existence," said Shallah, who is on a United States wanted list. Senior leaders of the ruling Islamist group, Hamas, joined
the open-air gathering, the largest for years in honor of Islamic Jihad with up to 100,000 attending according to its
organizers. Hamas allowed the group to use city terrain it usually reserves exclusively for its own rallies, and Hamas
forces provided security for the parade by its smaller rival.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Vietnam has decided to award Japan contracts to build two of four nuclear power plants it plans to
set up by the early 2020s, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. Prime Minister
Nguyen Tan Dung is expected to relay the Vietnamese leadership's decision on October 31 when he and Japanese Prime
Minister Naoto Kan meet for bilateral talks at a regional summit in Hanoi, Kyodo said. Earlier this month Japan said it
had agreed with Vietnam to cooperate on nuclear power plant technologies and materials. Japan, the world's third-
biggest nuclear power generator after the United States and France, is stepping up efforts to tap the nuclear power
development market overseas. In an effort to sell its atomic technologies abroad with the help of the government, a
joint venture of 13 Japanese firms including Toshiba Corp, Hitachi Ltd and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was formed this
month.

HANOI (AP) - A Southeast Asian official said the leaders of Japan and China have held an informal meeting at

Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan met Saturday on the sidelines of the summit of East Asian leaders in Hanoi,
Vietnam. There had been speculation they would not meet at all because of a dispute over a maritime territorial
dispute that plunged relations to a five-year low.

sets of penalties. Chamber of Commerce President Mohammad Nahavandian did say the sanctions have driven up the

MOSCOW (Reuters) — Prime Minister Putin told CNN television that Russia will deploy nuclear weapons and "strike
forces" if it is shut out of a Western missile defense system, echoing a warning from President Medvedev. In an interview
with Larry King, Putin said missile threats against Europe must be tackled jointly -- a reference to an agreement reached
at a Russia-NATO summit this month to cooperate on missile defense. But if Russia's proposals are rejected and new
threats appear along its borders, "Russia will have to ensure its own security," Putin said. Russia would "put in place new
strike forces.. .against the new threats which will have been created along our borders," Putin said. "New missile, nuclear
technologies will be put in place." Putin said Russia does not want this to happen and is not threatening the West, but the
remarks underscored the Kremlin's insistence on a significant role in a missile defense system and suggested ties could
sour badly if agreement is not reached.

Subject: (Reuters) Hamas would honor referendum on peace with Israel
GAZA (Reuters) - The Islamist Hamas movement, whose charter advocates the elimination of Israel, would accept the
outcome of a Palestinian referendum on a future peace treaty with the Jewish state, its Gaza leader said on December 1.
Ismail Haniyeh, addressing a rare news conference in the Israeli-blockaded enclave, signaled a softening of Hamas's
long-standing position prohibiting the ceding of any part of the land of what was British-mandated Palestine until 1948.
"We accept a Palestinian state on the borders of 1967, with Jerusalem as its capital, the release of Palestinian
prisoners, and the resolution of the issue of refugees," Haniyeh said, referring to the year of Middle East war in which
Israel captured East Jerusalem and the Palestinian territories.
"Hamas will respect the results (of a referendum) regardless of whether it differs with its ideology and principles," he
said, provided it included all Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank and the diaspora.
The Hamas charter, drafted in 1988, regards all of the land of Palestine, including what is now Israel, as the heritage
of Muslims. The idea of a referendum on a future peace accord with Israel was rejected by some Hamas leaders when it
was proposed by Palestinian President Abbas several months ago.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt's opposition Muslim Brotherhood, which held a fifth of seats in the outgoing parliament, has
pulled out of an election race after winning no seats in the first round, al-Arabiya television reported.
The group, which runs candidates as independents to skirt a ban on religious parties, said the vote was rigged in favor
of President Mubarak's ruling party.
Al-Arabiya said the group was pulling out of a run-off to be held on December 5. The group said 26 of its candidates
had made it through to the run-off. A senior Brotherhood official told Reuters an announcement would be made later
on December 1.

JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel is moving ahead with a plan for 625 new homes in east Jerusalem, angering Palestinians as
peace talks remain stuck over settlement construction. The plan received preliminary approval from a district planning
committee, which published an announcement on November 25. Further approval is required and construction will not
begin for about two years. Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said December 2 the move showed Israel had chosen
"settlements and not peace." The units are slated for Pisgat Zeev. While Israelis consider it a neighborhood of their
capital, the Palestinians see it as a settlement.

The vote December 2 was 333-79. It was only the 23rd time that the House invoked its most serious punishment
short of expulsion.
The solemn procedure calls for Rangel to appear at the front of the chamber while Speaker Nancy Pelosi reads the
censure resolution.
The 80-year-old Democrat has served in the House for 40 years.

established during its 2002-2003 civil war. In the northern opposition stronghold of Bouake, several hundred people
marched down a main boulevard, calling for incumbent Laurent Gbagbo to stand down. Villagers wielding machetes also
created their own checkpoint in protest along one major road in the region.

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON
The Cancun Agreements
Over the last year, the United States has worked with our international partners to build on the progress achieved at the
climate change conference in Copenhagen. We have pressed for substantive steps that would advance the vision of the
Copenhagen Accord. This month we joined the nations of the world in Cancun for a new round of talks aimed at
mobilizing common action to meet the shared global challenge of climate change.
Today I am pleased to announce that we secured the Cancun Agreements, a set of balanced international decisions
under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) which represent meaningful progress in
our global response to climate change.
These agreements advance each of the core elements of the Copenhagen Accord: They anchor the Accord's mitigation
pledges; build on a system of transparency with substantial detail and content of International Consultations and
Analysis which will provide confidence that a country's pledges are being carried out; launch a new Green Climate Fund;
create a framework to reduce deforestation in developing countries; establish a technology mechanism; and Setup a
framework and committee to will promote international cooperation and action on adaptation.
The Cancun Agreements represent a balanced and significant step forward. In the days and months ahead, the United
States will work with our friends and partners to keep the world focused on this urgent challenge and to continue
building on this progress.

details about Palin's itinerary are not being released for security reasons. The potential U.S. presidential candidate is
expected to visit the Haitian capital and stop by cholera-treatment centers and other projects of Graham's charity group.

Washington (CNN) -- The United States may have to expand its role from Middle East peace talks facilitator to become a
broker on specific core issues, Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad said on December 12. Appearing on the ABC
program "This Week," Fayyad indicated that progress toward a peace settlement could occur in the short-term despite
Israel's refusal to halt construction of new settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. However, Israel must
provide specifics about its position on core issues such as what a Palestinian state would entail, the status of Jerusalem
and the return of refugees, Fayyad said, adding that the lack of a new settlement freeze erodes trust in the process.
Asked if the United States would need to offer so-called "bridging" proposals on specific issues to try to stimulate
negotiations, Fayyad said that "may be necessary." "It may be unavoidable, actually, for the United States, acting as a
broker at some point, to come in with bridging proposals so we make this happen," he said. The interview, which
included Israeli opposition leader and former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, took place two days after U.S. Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton outlined a direction for the peace process after giving up on trying to persuade Israel to again freeze
settlement construction as a condition for the direct talks to resume.

Dear Huma and Jake:
If there is an appropriate way to do so, I wondered if you might convey to Secretary Clinton how much it meant to me
personally and to so many of us that she led us last night for cathartic story-telling and laughter. It was such a terrible
evening, but she managed to ignite warmth at a moment when everything felt frozen still. Her ability to lift us all up
after a trip to Canada, hosting a huge reception, and on top of her own loss, was itself a rallying cry to soldier on the way
Holbrooke would have insisted we do. She helped fill the tremendous sense of void with funny memories and an
appreciation of how deeply he touched so many of us. I felt better by the time I left, and still do.
Many thanks,
Suzanne

BERLIN (AP) - Germany's foreign minister is playing down the country's expectations for Afghanistan's future while
reiterating that German troops will start their withdrawal by the end of next year as planned. Guido Westerwelle told
parliament December 16 that after nearly a decade in Afghanistan, Germany has "more realistic expectations" for the
country, saying that Berlin is no longer expecting good governance but the more achievable goal of "good-enough
governance." Westerwelle says German troops will start withdrawing as planned in late 2011 and start handing over the
responsibility to Afghan authorities by the middle of next year. He says the last of Germany's current 4,600 troops are to
leave by 2014, saying the withdrawal must not endanger allied troops or leave the country in the hands of the Taliban.

RAMALLAH (AP) - Palestinian negotiators are for the first time asking European countries to recognize a Palestinian state
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, even without a peace deal with Israel. The move is part of growing Palestinian
campaign to pursue statehood outside of peace talks with Israel, which have been deadlocked since
September. Palestinian officials say they asked the consuls general of France, Britain, Sweden and Denmark as well as
the European Union envoy to the peace process to recognize the 1967 borders between Israel and "Palestine." The EU
says it will recognize a Palestinian state "when appropriate," but that negotiations are the only way to peace.
