Hi Burns,
I received the email below from Lyn Lusi, a highly trained and experienced program administrator with HEAL Africa
(Congo). I tried to line her up to be a speaker at the Global Summit that Hillary attended, but we were unable to book
her due to scheduling issues. She's not some random, run-of-the-mill aid worker; she's really, really special, having set
up the fistula hospital and teaching hospital in Goma with her husband, Dr. Jo Lusi. Lyn sent me this email and requested
I "do what I can" to encourage Hillary to empower the indigenous physicians and trained personnel in this hospital
rather than bring in outside partners to start something new.
Blessings to you,
Kay

Conversation: Suggested letter for follow up to Mrs Clinton's visit to HEAL Africa
Subject: Suggested letter for follow up to Mrs Clinton's visit to HEAL Africa
This is Lyn Lusi writing to you from HEAL Africa in Goma and your address comes from the business card you left me
when you visited us. You may have heard that Secretary of State Mrs Clinton and Ambassador Ms Verveer came to
HEAL Africa on Tuesday 11th August. The visit went very well, and the organisation was impeccable, so she could
achieve her objectives. While in our Conference Centre, she announced a package of aid to Congo to fight Gender Based
Violence.
First she congratulated HEAL Africa on the excellent work we are doing; then she announced a deal between the US and
the Norwegian Government to build a state of the art fistula and teaching hospital in Goma.
She must have been aware of the shock and discouragement of all our staff. In effect she was saying:
"Your excellent work is not really excellent at all, and we will work with the Norwegians to replace you in North Kivu."
I seriously believe she was not properly briefed, because of some remarks she made as she was leaving.
This is now a request to you, and if possible, other members of the your organisation, if you would be so kind as to
contact them. Nothing is set in stone, and politicians respond to pressure from their friends and constituencies. We
believe that wise use of funds means building capacity among local organisations that have already proved that they can
do the work, and sustain their efforts, rather than starting something new.
I am attaching below a letter like the one we have written to Mrs Clinton and a similar one to Ambassador Verveer. If
you think it is appropriate, we are requesting you to write a similar letter to both of them. We are hoping that local
Congolese organisations will not be excluded from these resources to build local capacity on the foundations of what is
being done already.
With kind regards.
Lyn Lusi

SUGGESTED LETTER
Secretary of State Mrs Hillary Clinton
U.S. Department of State

Washington, DC 20520
Goma, 11th August 2009
Dear Mrs Clinton,
If We followed with interest reports of your visit to Goma on 11th August 2009, where you convened a meeting of
Congolese actors in the fight against Gender Based Violence at HEAL Africa training center. The commitment of the
people of the United States to working alongside Congolese associations for peace and human rights is heartening, after
16 years of endless war.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05763788 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05763788 Date: 07/31/2015
We congratulate you for this pioneering visit which gave a voice to Congolese community based organizations, who are
often overpowered by international actors. We sincerely hope that the US government and USAID will take the next step
in working alongside community based organizations in Eastern Congo.
After studying the announcement of the package of assistance that is being prepared to contribute to fighting Gender
Based Violence in the east of Congo, we are mystified to hear that the United States and the Norwegian government
have decided to build for North Kivu a centre of excellence for training doctors in fistula repair and care of mothers.
According to good development principles, outside assistance builds on what is already in place and functioning well,
developing proven capacity and giving local actors the additional tools they need to do a better job.
As friends and supporters of HEAL Africa for many years, we know that this hospital has pioneered fistula repair in North
Kivu and Maniema provinces since 2002, when no one else was interested in caring for women with fistula. They have
four experienced surgeons trained in Addis Ababa fistula hospital, and have performed over 1600 fistula surgeries. HEAL
Africa has a wide network of community based workers to identify and support patients coming and returning. HEAL
Africa's surgical teams perform outreach surgery in North Kivu and Maniema provinces in local general hospitals, linked
at the same time with in-service training of local staff, and referring only the most complicated cases to Goma. These
services are recognized by reputable agencies since the United States through IRC, through UNICEF and through
Engenderhealth, has invested in HEAL Africa staff, equipment and infrastructure over the past five year. The Spanish
Embassy has supported HEAL Africa's prevention of fistula initiatives over the past four years, through their wide-
reaching Safe Motherhood program, working through local associations of mothers-to-be for maternity insurance and
access to safe deliveries.
HEAL Africa has a clearly defined place within the government medical system of North Kivu where they are recognized
as the tertiary referral hospital of the province. Thus they are a recognized clinical training centre of the Medical Faculty
of the University of Goma, offering the first two years of accredited clinical specialization in Pediatrics, Obstetrics and
Gynecology, Family Medicine, Surgery and Orthopedics.
HEAL Africa is a Congolese not for profit association which has completely rebuilt itself after total destruction by the
volcano, with assistance from many friends in USA and around the world. They have a state of the art surgical suite, but
the buildings hastily erected in the aftermath of the volcano are inappropriate for the quality of care they wish to offer
to patients: they deserve better.
We wish to request that the State Department give assistance to HEAL Africa to increase the quality of their services and
training capacity through the newly announced package of financial aid. We would like to ask you to fund the
construction of the three storey building which is the final stage of reconstruction of the hospital after the catastrophe
of the volcano in January 2002. The second floor of this building will be entirely devoted to women's fistula services;

and the whole hospital is devoted to teaching and preparing Congolese doctors to give excellent service in the most
underserved areas of Congo.
Many visitors from the US Embassy in Kinshasa, from USAID in Washington and Nairobi, the Secretary General of the
United Nations Mr Ban Ki Moon, Ms Rice from the Security Council, US senators and deputies, and a great number of
aides from your government have visited HEAL Africa and have come away enchanted by a hospital of excellence run
entirely by Congolese staff of the highest caliber. They are hoping that, through your visit, you will be able to advocate
for the physical plant that will enable them to serve their patients even better than before, and train the next generation
of doctors in an environment where it is possible to practice excellent medicine.
We remain, respectfully,
Yours sincerely,

learned that died this weekend. We do not know more than that and so far, there is nothing in the
press about it. I thought you and the Secretary would want know about this. Will update you if I learn more.

Odds On the Big A <http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/09/odds-on-big.html>
Even as Governor Paterson reportedly has his recommendation on the Aqueduct racino in hand (this reader says
that he actually has two to consider <http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/09/sunday-morning-notes-and-
nuts.html#comment-1156672372250588546> ), at least one of the bidders is still taking its case to the local community
around the track. The Queens Chronicle reported last week
<http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=20368289&BRD=2731&PAG=461&dept_id=574908&rfi=6> that SL
Green/Hard Rock made a presentation on Thursday.
"Hard Rock is the right balance," [Pres/CEO Marc] Holliday said. "Its recognized brand and quality entertainment
will attract younger and older players across the stratum. People flying in from JFK will say, 'I hear there's a Hard Rock, I
want to see it."
One of this group's big pitches is that they'll be the first to generate a revenue stream ("shovel-ready, in the
ground, the day after the award.")
And thanks to the reader who alerted us to this article in Crain's
<http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20090913/FREE/309139964> which, more importantly than comprising yet
another virtual press release for Steve Wynn, contains, towards the bottom, a handy pocket guide to the six bidders, the
financial portion of their bids (or at least what is known about them), and the ups and downs of their proposals.
This is a tough call; handicapping without the Form as I said before. I can't say I have a favorite; neither a
particular personal preference, nor a clue as to the most likely winner. But I'll give it a shot and take the Crain's piece
one step further by coming up with a morning line.
<http://1.bp.blogspot.com/2(111ri4LCfk/Sq2_nTNU j1/AAAAAAAABHM/UucITWnkilM/s1600-
h/dont_bother.jpg> Aqueduct Entertainment Group <http://www.aqueductentertainment.com/> (3-1): Competitive bid
of $251 million (contingent on 7,650 machines; $301 million with 10,000), a plethora of local connections on the real
estate/construction side, and approval by local unions could compensate for the lack of brand name recognition of
gaming partner The Navegante Group. Presence of Senator Malcolm Smith's longtime confidante Rev. Floyd Flake
doesn't hurt either.
SL Green/Hard Rock (4-1) - Boosted its bid to $275 million, and has the Hard Rock brand name as mentioned
above. Manhattan-based realtor SL Green has been endorsed by several local unions
<http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3601/is_43_54/ai_n27894917/> . But, as mentioned by Crain's, they were
passed over in favor of Delaware North the first time around.
Aqueduct Gaming (6-1), Buffalo-based Delaware North's group, has rallied late with a stepped-up publicity effort
and a major community initiative <http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/08/back-in-game.html> after appearing
indifferent early on (though it's original $100 million upfront offer remains intact with an additional $200 million to
follow). The addition of Harrah's <http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Aqueduct-Gaming-LIc-1034906.html>
adds an experienced operator and an interesting cross-marketing twist which is probably not allowed under the now-
disappeared MOU. And, like the two bidders above, Aqueduct Gaming has been reported to have reached
accommodations with the unions. So I listed them as the third choice on these merits. However, a part of me wants to
list them as the rank outsider - I'd be pretty damn shocked if the state goes back to the company which dropped out
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765936 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765936 Date: 07/31/2015
after failing to raise the money last time. And, as I've mentioned several times, given the reports of an investigation
<http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/05/01/2009-05-
01_attorney_general_andrew_cuomo_subpoenas_contracts_won_by_clients_of firm_tied_to.html> by Attorney
General Andrew Cuomo into lobbyist Patricia Lynch's dealings with the Assembly Speaker, I don't know if her
involvement here is going to help or hurt.
Steve Wynn (8-1) has offered $300 million, but he was the only bidder of the six contenders to receive a bad
grade from the hotel unions <http://www.timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storylD=838256&category=STATE> as
reported by Jim Odato in the Times Union last week. Whatsmore, the scale of his building proposal
<http://www.queenstribune.com/news/1250798405.html> is laughably ridiculous, and it wouldn't be ready until 2011.
He'd be the favorite if the decision is based on the number of newspaper and online articles
<http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/08/all-wynn-all-of-time.html> each bidder has been featured in. But, quite
simply, he sometimes comes off as a nut
<http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/cindy_adams/wynn_hopes_to_win_race_for_race_hzqJ384wLxUSxFKsUWiSyM> .
Penn National (12-1) might be worth a ducat at long odds. No local connection here makes them a dark horse.
But a $250 million bid (as reported elsewhere <http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/17717/penn-national-
lobbies-up/> though not in the Crain's piece) puts them in the ballgame, and the company is an experienced gaming
operator with a solid balance sheet
<http://www.businessweek.com/investor/content/aug2009/pi20090814_742719.htm> which would probably do as
competent a job as anyone else.
R. Donahue Peebles/MGM Mirage (20-1) didn't increase its $150 million bid, and doesn't have a lobbyist; good
luck with that. Whatsmore, no local flavor and MGM Mirage has had some well-publicized financial woes (though things
have been looking up of late <http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125212120561188377.html> ). Would be a major
surprise.

Judith,
Can't remember whether I forwarded this stuff to you.
As you can see, our staff feel that the Dialogue went pretty well in the press — and it continues to do well. The Foreign
Minister -- now claiming credit for changing our TSA airport screening policy -- is promising to "take Parliament into
confidence" on the dialogue in the near future. I'm going to be out talking at a think tank on Weds; Holbrooke will be
here next week.

U.S.-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue Media Summary
The U.S.-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue dominated Pakistani media on March 24 and March 25. All major English and Urdu
language networks carried live the Secretary and Foreign Minister Qureshi's remarks at the opening session. On
Thursday morning, nearly all television networks led with coverage of the joint press availability. All major English and
Urdu language dailies featured the talks on their front pages, highlighting the Secretary's announcement of $125 million
in aid to Pakistan's energy sector. Reporting was straight-forward with favorable headlines: Dawn—"U.S, Pakistan
pledge to boost and broaden ties" and "U.S. to provide $125m for energy, power plants"; The News—"US vows to boost
energy, defence, trade ties"; Nawa-i-Waqt—"U.S. will neither abandon nor dictate to Pakistan"; The Nation—"New day'
for US, Pakistan: Hillary." Media highlighted the positive shift in U.S.-Pakistan relations, echoing Secretary Clinton's
statement that the talks are the beginning of a new chapter. Reports also focused on the question of nuclear
cooperation and U.S. engagement in the Kashmir dispute; however the U.S. position on these issues had been widely
reported by the media prior to the Dialogue. The Nation published an editorial, entitled "Negative starting note,"
criticizing the talks before they began. The daily stated that "promises will be made on some issues, including on nuclear
cooperation, which will not see fruition." Other editorials stressed the need for a sustained commitment on both sides,
beyond March 24, to produce results: Dawn – "Prospects for Pak-US ties," and Daily Times—"Pak-US Strategic
Dialogue." End Summary.

In light of Clegg's rising popularity partly based on his anti-Americanism and Germany's growing hegemony in Europe
while becoming more insular, John Kornblum has written this op-ed with reference in last graphs to US policy.

Germany in Need of a Dream
By JOHN KORNBLUM
Has Germany abandoned Europe? Do Angela Merkel's tough conditions for aid to Greece mean that Germany is no
longer the motor of European integration? Has Frau Merkel in fact morphed from the Miss Europa of 2007 to the
Fraulein Germania of 2010, as Germany's own former foreign minister Joschka Fischer has suggested?
As a former American ambassador who has lived and worked the better part of four decades around Germany, my
Blackberry often glows red hot with messages from persons asking these questions. My response is always the same:
Germany has changed very little, but Europe and the world have changed a lot. Therein lies the dilemma.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768699 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768699 Date: 08/31/2015
Germany has worked hard to dig its way out of the disaster of 1945, but trauma remains a defining issue for German
society. Sixty five years later, Germany is still focused on the three essentials of its recovery: stability, respectability and
peace. Keep this triangle in mind and lots of things quickly come into focus.
From the first days of the Federal Republic, Germany's leaders emphasized the importance of defining interests solely
within a common European and Atlantic vocation. But they also understood that renouncing national ambitions did not
remove the responsibility to pursue specific German goals through the common institutions.
Many important postwar accomplishments were conceived and pushed by Germany, sometimes over the opposition of
others — including the United States. Ostpolitik was controversial for years, as was NATO enlargement. Germany
pushed them with determination.
Helmut Kohl did not consult before promulgating his 10 points on reunification. He agreed to French desires for a
common currency, but only if it could be a mirror of the Deutsche mark, for decades the European monetary standard.
The euro stability pact, now the object of so much controversy with Greece, was the result. After 1990, the E.U.'s
eastward expansion was Germany's way of firming up its Eastern flank.
Slowly and without fanfare, Germany has been remaking the European Union in its image. At each step of the way,
Germany made its wishes more palatable by paying more than its share. Part of today's misunderstanding is caused by
Germany's success in using its contributions to build an image of selflessness. Germany has been as single-minded in
pursuit of its goals as Charles de Gaulle ever was for his, but it almost always left leadership to others.
A new consciousness grew after the costs of reunification began to mount. "Europe" in the institutional sense has
become increasingly unpopular. German courts have begun to define German European issues in the context of the
German Constitution rather than on the basis of E.U. law. At least some of Ms. Merkel's refusal to allow immediate
assistance to Greece was based on her fears that it would fan anti-E.U. sentiment at home. Are these the first signs of a
German Tea Party?
Here we find the source of most of the hand wringing about Germany's role as the "motor of Europe." Ms. Merkel's
unwillingness to sweeten the financial pot echoed throughout Brussels. To many, it signified the decline of German
willingness to "salute the French flag three times before raising the German flag," as Konrad Adenauer used to put it.
Germans are not alone in objecting to throwing more money into the E.U. pot, but they happen to be the only ones who
can do something about it. Many fear that without German complaisance, the E.U. will stutter to a stop. But such self-
denial could never offer a viable foundation for a new Europe. Neither could the inefficiency and even corruption that
characterizes many E.U. programs.
Most maddening for most thinking Europeans is the knowledge that the Germans are right. But to them, the question is
whether Germany is remaking the E.U. in a fashion palatable to the majority of other member states. They are not so
sure that its focus on stability and accountability is the right way to help such a diverse collection of peoples adjust to a
globalized world.
And so when Angela Merkel raps Greek knuckles, she is sending a message most Europeans don't want to hear. Not that
Germany is dangerous; even worse, that it is unrelenting. The Neue Ziiricher Zeitung probably spoke for many others
when it once accused Germany of wanting Europe to become a large Switzerland.
The growing gap between Germany's aspirations and the perceived needs of other members of the E.U. is beginning to
burden both sides. Most Europeans are simply not ready to live up to German standards. Without a more flexible sense
of common purpose, the project to build a democratic Europe could stop dead in the water. But as Germans will
themselves often tell you: They have forgotten how to dream.
Younger Germans feel this lack of inspiration as well. Dreams were what 200,000 of them were waiting to hear when
they rallied to hear Barack Obama in Berlin two summers ago. They wanted more than to "Dare to Hope," which is the
characteristically timid German translation of the title of the president's best seller. And they are still waiting. America
seems busy elsewhere.
The main conclusion I draw from the debate about Germany is that it is not about Germany at all. The task of building a
democratic Europe is far from complete. Most of the foundations have been laid and now the residents are starting to
haggle over the design. Weaving today's 27 states into a true trans-Atlantic partnership is a task that is too big for
Germany or even Europe to accomplish alone. They desperately need some skilled architectural assistance.
Uniting Europe and North America is the most audacious project ever conceived. If it works, the United States will be
joined by nearly 500 million Europeans to form a democratic space, within which modern democratic values will harness
more energy than in any single nation on earth. Democracy's future as the operating system for a globalized world will
be assured.

European fecklessness seems to worry Washington officials these days. But if Germany has forgotten how to dream and
the United States is too busy to try, we will both be guilty of perpetuating the aimlessness we so criticize. To hold up its
side of the bargain, Europe needs exactly what Barack Obama originally promised — the audacity of hope.

Germany from 1997 to 2001.

Hi, Huma,
Please share this with Hillary.
Thanks,

Dear Hillary,
I am hoping we can pick up the threads of our previous conversations, including meeting again with Cheryl. I continue to
believe that I can - and would very much like to - be able to contribute meaningfully to your work and the mission of the
Department. Issues having to do with the status of children world-wide, health liaison to US AID and a variety of issues
within the realm of disaster response and preparedness.
- I just today participated in and spoke at a major conference in DC on nuclear terrorism. Most of the speakers and
participants were federal officials, including WH staff. One of the key points I made was the extraordinary disconnect
between administration concerns with respect to the possibility of IND/nuclear terrorism and the degree to which this is
essentially ignored in state and local disaster planning, including in the principal target cities. My discussions with
officials in Great Britain and a couple of other countries reveal a similar inability to deal with nuclear preparedness. For
many of these folks, here and abroad, images of apocalyptic destruction - as was the actual threat during the nuclear
arms race with the Soviets - are just paralyzing.
However, a terrorist IND, is not an all-out nuclear war. Current, scientific modeling suggests that minimal planning for
an IND could save hundreds of thousands of lives and create a much high level of resiliency than we currently have
I believe that an international consortium of disaster response and recovery planning officials should be considered as a
means of increasing attention and resources focused on nuclear - and CBRNE in general - terrorism readiness. We have

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768853 Date: 08/31/2015
much that could be learned from one another in terms of advancing this work. My center at Columbia recently held a
very successful and productive conference called "Day 3"
, focused on the regional conditions and projections 72 hours post IND detonation.
- Natural disasters also remain a major challenge and potentially increasingly so over the years to come. I feel that
there is much to be gained by upgrading the level and quality of our international collaboration around disaster
response planning - and particularly major disaster recovery, still one of the great unsolved challenges world-wide.
-As a member of the federally appointed National Commission on Children and Disasters, we just completed a field
hearing of state and federal officials on the management of children brought from Haiti to Florida for medical care and
humanitarian rescue. Some were American nationals, others not. But the reports from people involved in the process
were overwhelmingly concerned about lack of coordination, dangerously inadequate information accompanying many
of the kids who came over and lots of less than positive feedback about operations within Haiti. I believe that I could
help in the organization of emergency response, overseeing some of the key functions in managing international
disasters which end up involving the U.S.
-I had a chance and very interesting meeting with Ban Ki-Moon 2 weeks ago. I mentioned an idea I have been thinking
about having to do with another world children's summit. The last one was in 1990, held at the U.N. and involving
about 150 countries, including heads of state from about 45 - 50 nations. Conditions for children were outlined and
goals set for future improvements - many of which were met, many not.. We are overdue for another world gathering
focused on children. This would obviously by in Tony Lake's purview, and I was going to visit with him, bringing Jeff
Sachs with me.
- We did discuss this a bit last year, but I am hoping that the U.S.
could continue to expand its involvement in global health diplomacy strategies as a part of U.S. smart power agenda.
The global health program at Columbia - and a number of other academic centers - could provide resources, ideas,
programs, expertise and relevant research to bolster such efforts. •
If you think it would be worthwhile, I would look forward to continuing our conversations.
Warm regards,
Irwin

Here is a weekend factoid for you: among all living politicians in the United States who have ever held elected office,
Hillary Clinton the most popular.
That's right. Ever since she became Secretary of State, her favorables have soared into the mid-60's
<http://www.pollingreport.com/C2.htm#HiIlary>, putting her well clear of any other statewide officeholder in the
country. The only national figures who are viewed as favorably as Clinton are Michelle Obama
<http://www.pollingreport.com/o.htm#MicheUe>, Colin Powell <http://www.pollingreport.com/p.htm#powell>, and
David Patraeus <http://www.pollingreport.com/p.htm#petraeus>. However, they have never run for office, which
invariably lowers your favorables.
Hillary Clinton will turn 69 in in the final week of the 2016 campaign, which makes her slightly younger than Ronald
Reagan when he first was elected in 1980. Also, as Secretary of State, a major presidential candidate, a U.S. Senator,
and First Lady, she is also probably more credentialed than any other potential Presidential candidate, too. There is
even talk she may become the next Secretary of Defense <http://www.pohitico.corn/news/stories/0510/37672.htmt>,
further adding to her credentials.
Some have said that, in choosing Joe Biden as Vice-President, Barack Obama did not pick a successor to lead the
Democratic Party. However, that needs rethinking. Because Barack Obama made her Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton
remains remarkably well-positioned to run for President in 2016, even more so than she was in 2008.
Anyway, have a good holiday weekend.
Chris Bowers <http://www.openleft.com/userDiary.do?personld=9> :: Hillary Clinton is now the most popular politician
in America who has held elected office <http://www.openleft.com/showDiary.do?diaryld=18891

Yes that is the cell number her office gave us- I've verified it so I assume it's for one of her aides. I left a couple of
messages there but didn't hear back. I will try her office again to see if we can secure any better number. I also know
huma emailed with elena earlier in the week.

Nor do I. Its strange that it seems to be a recent problem with our emails, and there is no rhyme or reason to why some
go through and others don't. In the mean time, ill always confirm for you right away when I receive your emails, even if
an answer is still pending.

I did not. Very aggravating. There is some kind of disconnect. We are still waiting to hear back on mashabane's
availability. Nothing yet scheduled for tomorrow, but we still have menendez and alexander outstanding. Menendez's
staff owes us a call back. Alexander is free up until 1pm tomorrow.

My hope is that progress can now be made in the Middle East, Korea, Sudan, and Cuba, and we are eager to help
if you call on us. For instance, we have an enormous group of religious leaders with whom we have been working, which
includes prominent Mainline Protestants, Catholics, Evangelicals, African-Americans and Hispanics from across the
theological and political spectrum. They can issue public statements, OpEds, etc. to support your efforts with the Israelis
and Palestinians. Just have one of your staff members let me know at any time. Also, The Elders are eager for our efforts
to be constructive. Our prayers and hopes are with you. Jimmy

Hi Hillary -
Met Indra today for the first time. Spent the entire time not talking about me and my new law firm (!) but about you and
why we both admired and supported you so. And still do.
She is a most remarkable person. And quite devoted to you.
Her daughter Preetha, as you may know, started in Iowa and stayed on in campaign as volunteer all the way through
South Dakota and Montana.
And in all that time she never personally met you -- and "still grieves" (her mon's words) your loss. (Joining a big club!!!)
Can I call Cheryl and arrange a quick stop-by and handshake and photo any time--no rush--at your convenience?
Hope you are well - you look better than ever--as does President Clinton! And we are not getting any younger!!!
Warmest regards,
Lanny

War on terror: Obama softened the language, but hardened Muslim hearts
The Obama administration's shift in counterterrorism language sought to bridge the divide with the Muslim world and
soften Americans' fear of Islam. But the new rhetoric hasn't matched policy, and the unintended costs at home and
abroad have been high.
By Stuart Gottlieb <http://www.csmonitor.com/layout/set/print/About/Contact-Us-Feedback>
posted October 14, 2010 at 9:58 am EDT
New Haven, Conn. —
One of the most defining aspects of the Obama administration's counterterrorism strategy has been its effort to change
America's rhetorical approach to the threat of terrorism <http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2009/0129/obama-
redefines-war-on-terror> , particularly Islamic terrorism. "The language we use matters," President Obama told the
Arabic satellite television station Al Arabiya in an interview during his first week in office. Scrubbed were George W.
Bush-era terms like "war on terrorism," "radical Islam," and "jihadist." <http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0901/p03s03-
uspo.html> The White House's 2010 National Security Strategy formally replaced the term "Islamic terrorism" with
"violent extremism."
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771519 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771519 Date: 08/31/2015
The purpose of the shift in semantics was two-fold.
First, it aimed to repackage the fight against terrorism as a specific fight against Al Qaeda, not against Islamic extremism,
which Mr. Obama believes contributed to a post-9/11 perception that America was "at war with Islam." Indeed, the new
rhetoric <http://www.csmonitor.com/World/G lobal-News/2009/0604/in-fra nce-oba ma-erases-the-us-vs-them-
rhetoric> has gone hand in hand with Obama's outreach to the Muslim world
<http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2009/0605/p06s01-wome.html> to build "a new partnership based on
mutual respect and mutual interest."
Second, it was part of a broader effort to soften Americans' fear of Islamic terrorism, which Obama officials believe plays
directly into the hands of extremists.
Language change ineffective
Now it is fair to ask whether Obama's use of language regarding terrorism has proven effective. Startling new polls
suggest it hasn't. The first, by the Brookings Institution in Washington, shows that between May 2009 and May 2010 the
number of Middle Eastern Arabs expressing optimism in Obama's approach toward their region dropped
<http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-News/2010/0806/0bama-s-popularity-may-be-down-in-US-but-he-s-even-
less-popular-among-Arabs> from 51 percent to just 16 percent, with those describing themselves as "discouraged" by
the Obama presidency rising from 15 percent to 63 percent.
The second, by the Pew Research Center, shows that in August 2010 fewer Americans held a favorable view of Islam (30
percent) than five years earlier during the Bush administration (41 percent), with more Americans (35 percent) saying
Islam encourages violence more than other religions (in 2002, it was 25 percent).
These starkly negative trend lines suggest the limited utility of language in fighting terrorism. Yes, terrorism is a
propaganda-fueled activity — an ongoing battle to win hearts and minds <http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-
East/2009/0603/p06s16-wome.html> and attract new recruits to fight for the cause. And of course the language used in
combating terrorism <http://www.csmonitorcom/USA/Foreign-Policy/2008/0801/p02s01-usfp.html> is vital — the
counterproductive "smoke 'em out" rhetoric of the Bush administration <http://www.csmonitor.com/2001/0919/p12s2-
woeu.html> is a case in point.
But if rhetoric does not match policy, or appears to discount or play down threats, the credibility — and thus
effectiveness — of the overall counterterrorism strategy may be undermined. It appears the Obama administration has
dug itself into just such a hole.
Rhetoric doesn't match policy
When looking beyond the nuanced language and appealing promises, what Muslims around the world see is an
administration that has ramped up the war in Afghanistan
<http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0609/0bama-wants-more-money-for-Afghanistan-war.-Will-Congress-
grant-it> ; is killing scores of Muslim civilians with drone strikes <http://www.csmonitor.com/World/terrorism-
security/2010/0915/US-drone-attacks-bombard-Haqqani-network-in-Pakistan> ; continues to hold more than 1,000
Muslim detainees in Guantanamo <http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Topics/Guantanamo>, Bagram, and other prisons;
and maintains seemingly unconditional support of Israel.
This is not to critique these policies, but to point out that they do not match the raised expectations of the Muslim world
and have only muddled Obama's oft-stated goal of turning Muslims toward America and away from extremist
movements.

The price of downplaying the threat
A large price is also being paid domestically for disconnected rhetoric. Despite maintaining nearly all of Bush's hard-line
tactics — the USA Patriot Act <http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0301/0bama-signs-Patriot-Act-extension-
without-reforms> , warrantless surveillance, indefinite detentions — the White House has consistently played down the
threat, even in the face of a clear uptick in terrorism activity.
For example, following the failed 2009 Christmas Day airline bombing
<http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0102/Calling-it-war-Obama-pegs-Christmas-Day-attack-to-Al-Qaeda> ,
Obama described the suspect as an "isolated extremist," despite his ties to Al Qaeda. And the administration's initial
response to the failed May 2010 Times Square bombing <http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2010/0509/Times-Square-
bombing-Sign-of-desperation-from-Pakistan-Taliban> by an American Muslim trained in Pakistan was to call it a "one-
off" event. Attorney General Eric Holder stated <http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2010/0203/Holder-letter-why-
we-read-Christmas-Day-bomber-his-rights> in congressional testimony that he believed these and other recent Islamic
terror plots were unconnected, and unrelated to radical Islam.
There is little doubt that the administration's unwillingness to speak candidly about Islamic terrorism has taken a toll on
the public's trust. A Gallup poll released last month shows Americans favoring Republicans over Democrats on the issue
of terrorism 55 percent to 31 percent — up from 49 percent to 42 percent last fall.
Time to reverse the trend
Obama entered office promising to fight a smarter and more effective war on terrorism, and in many ways he has. His
instincts to maintain aggressive tactics while toning down inflammatory rhetoric
<http://www.csmonitorcom/2006/0517/p09s01-cojh.html> were sound. Yet his administration seems to have
overlearned a key lesson of the Bush years — that overstating the threat of terrorism
<http://www.csmonitorcom/2007/0418/p04s01-woeu.html> has costs attached. So, too, does rhetoric that
understates the threat, especially when detached from policy.
It is not too late to reverse this troubling trend. The White House can begin by focusing less on overly reassuring rhetoric
— which has not paid dividends at home or abroad — and more on a candid accounting of the threats faced
<http://www.csmonitorcom/2006/0905/p14s02-bogn.html> and the policies employed to confront them.

> Subject: From Arturo - Correa Rescued in Ecuador
> Madame Secretary: After a tense day in which President Correa was slightly injured at noon by rioting and striking
police, and later was barred from leaving the hospital by the same, the army finally rescued him at 9pm last night. Some
military units, including the Navy unit in Guayaquil appeared to support the police. The police also occupied the national
congress. As the rescue took place, the head of the Ecuadoran Joints Chiefs of Staff issued a statement supporting the
president, and noting that the armed forces respect the rule of law "in which the President [Rafael Correa] is the
maximum authority of the three branches." Things are now calm.
> Reaction in the hemisphere was one of deep concern. The OAS adopted a resolution; South American presidents at the
call of UNASUR travelled to Buenos Aires and are likely to go on to Quito to support Correa. Several, including Garcia and
Santos, called Correa. Zapatero also spoke with him. ivioratinos tried to reach you at around 6prn last evening to convey
that news, I took the call.
> As you know, we issued a statement of support for Correa. I also gave an interview to CNN in Spanish, which was re-
played frequently. I strongly recommend that you call Correa today to reiterate U.S. support for his government and to
wish him well.
> He will appreciate it but, more broadly, it sends a signal that the United States supports the constitutional order and
rejects any attempt to undermine it. Chavez in Buenos Aires predictably declared that we were behind the unrest. We
have prepared a call sheet for you.
> Regards,

extremism. Nor is the Tea Party being revealed as an extremist takeover movement. Nor is the Republicans' motive for
smearing Obama being identified as a cynical strategy to put Boehner in power.

Biblical proportions" in November. the House is gone; he sees a new bloc of up to 10 true conservative senators, joining
Coburn and DeMint, and creating a Vrtual third party in Senate holding balance of power. He says their polling suggests
Tea Party candidates well ahead in Ky., Colo., senate races (NYT disputes that today) , and Nevada still a tossup. .1 went
to the Glenn Back rally, and largely agreed with my assessment that its purpose in part was to inoculate the
movement against public concern over extremism and racism leading up to election. (Thus theme of Faith, Hope,
Charity.) Americans for Prosperity (Koch group) made sure there were no signs, etc.

you recall, nixed investigations of Bush administration because he wanted to unite the country.) Would there be an
investigation of Obama citizenship?? couldnt say b ecause he is now totally focused on the election, not what comes
after.
My take: Of course House will vote to repeal health care reform (despite no chance of senate passage)
; funding dozens of EPA initiatives in Appropriations Committee, and there will be stand-alone vote to block EPA from
implementing carbon rules (even though EPA is only acting as a result of a Supreme Court decision); and budget
legislation that adopts part of the Ryan plan (tho not privatization of SS.)..

Subject: CARE Policy Recommendations to Meet the MDGs
Dear Ms. Mills:
CARE is pleased that the international community will come together at the Millennium Development Goals (MDG)
Summit from Sept. 20-22, 2010, in New York, to recommit to and accelerate progress toward the achievement of the
MDGs by 2015. We also welcome the United States' Strategy for Meeting the Millennium Development Goals,
"Celebrate, Innovate and Sustain: Toward 2015 and Beyond." While we have made progress on some goals, we still
have much to do if we are going to meet these global commitments by 2015.
Attached or linked below are CARE's recommendations for meeting the Millennium Development Goals and for
strengthening the US' MDG strategy. Our recommendations include approaches and strategies proven to deliver results
specifically on MDGs 1, 3, 5 and 7. CARE's reflections on the MDGs are drawn from more than 60 years of experience
working with the poorest communities in more than 70 countries around the world. Women are at the heart of CARE's
efforts because experience shows that a woman's achievements yield dramatic benefits for her entire family and the

larger community. Promoting gender equality and women's empowerment is central to poverty reduction and the
achievement of all MDGs.
The MDG Summit provides a critical opportunity to take bold and decisive action. CARE believes that the following
guiding principles must be reflected in the outcome of the MDG Summit, in the US' MDG strategy, as well as in the US'
and the international community's implementation efforts:
• An emphasis on meeting the needs of people in extreme poverty and the most vulnerable populations;
• Promotion of gender equality, gender responsiveness, and the empowerment of women;
• Adherence to broad-based country ownership, including broad stakeholder engagement with local communities,
women's groups, and other vulnerable populations, in a whole-of-society approach to development;
• Recognition of the linkages among the eight MDGs; and
• A commitment to transparency, mutual accountability, and mechanisms to track results.
Any recommitment to the MDGs must be coupled with commitments to mobilize the necessary resources that will reach
the people who need them most. In the context of the US' development strategy, CARE also believes that USAID must be
empowered as the premier US development agency to lead these efforts, and we call on the Administration and
Congress to work together to reform and modernize US foreign assistance policies, efforts and strategies.
CARE urges bold efforts to recommit to the MDGs and ensure progress toward their achievement. The MDG Summit can
be the turning point in collective efforts to achieve the MDGs by 2015. It is critical that the global community unite
around a shared action-oriented strategy for meeting — and exceeding — these goals and begin to lay the groundwork for
post-2015.
CARE stands ready to support your efforts and looks forward to continuing valuable collaboration with the US
government and other leaders to tackle poverty worldwide. Please do not hesitate to call on us.
Sincerely,
Helene D. Gayle, MD, MPH
President & CEO, CARE USA

The way you are coming across couldn't be better.
Hillary Clinton sends strong message to world
SF Chronicle Editorial Friday, September 10, 2010
Hillary Clinton's blend of diligence, caution and toughness didn't always serve her well as a presidential candidate. But
these attributes make her a powerful secretary of state, the unsung hero for a White House team trying to mend global
fences without looking weak.
In a speech this week, Clinton laid down the law for an audience wondering where Obama is headed on foreign policy.
Would she favor hand-holding with rivals such as China and Russia, a sign that Washington was ducking trouble in the
name of consensus building?
Not at all, suggested Clinton in a lengthy speech to the Council of Foreign Relations. In her diplomatic travels, she found
a hunger for U.S. leadership, and she wants everyone to know it. "The U.S. can, must and will lead in this century," she
said. The "complexities of this world" mean there's an opening for "a new American moment, a moment when our
global leadership is essential."
Her message of strength and obligation may make Obama truehearts swoon. Clinton's thoughts also come at the start of
an election season when President Obama will be knocked for failures overseas along with the economy.
But it's also vintage Clinton. From her days on the Senate's Armed Services Committee, she was always a proponent of
military muscle and a tough regard for American foes. She and Defense Secretary Robert Gates, another hawkish voice,
are running the Obama foreign policy store.
Diplomatic speeches, even one as striking as Clinton's, are a dime a dozen. Clinton's challenge will be delivering on any
of the disputes facing her. There's a long line: a truculent North Korea, new Mideast talks, a rising China, a defiant Iran,
and a half dozen lesser conflicts ranging from African civil wars to drug gangs in Mexico.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772308 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772308 Date: 08/31/2015
There is newness and complication in her outlook, she indicated. Her job is essentially a permanent road trip, meaning
success will hinge on "shoe-leather diplomacy," the steady attention that the wonky, workaholic Clinton believes is
needed for any breakthrough. The Israeli-Palestinian talks, which begin again next week with her at the center, are a
chance for her patience and force to pay off. On Iran, she believes that ever-tightening sanctions accepted by a larger
group of nations will eventually pay off.
Her remarks come with other conditions. A soaring national debt and recession worries preoccupy the White House. The
nation's global reach is bounded by financial limits. Her robust views about American might could easily fade next to
more pressing domestic worries. Also, no matter how thoughtful or acute her remarks, there will always be detractors
who think she's angling for the top job in the White House.
Clinton's doctrine adds urgency in settling affairs on a crowded world stage. Washington has a special duty to lead, a
role that much of the world appreciates. It's time to accept that role, not shy away from it because of political risk or
recent history.

Whv is the Julia Roberts interview during the time I have weekly depoartmental meeting?
Also, I don't see a mtg w POTUS on the 15th--can we get that scheduled?
T want to have my own pre-brief before the Kissinger event.
And. I notice that the HBO event conflicts w a PC mtg at NH. Now w/Doniion in charge can
we get a set time for all the regular mtgs so we don't schedule conflicting events?
When is Adm Mullen having his small Pakistan dinner? if it's the 21st, can I get back in
time from Paris?
If La Raze can pay for a reception for Raul, why is his swearing in ceremony in the
Treaty Room instead of the Franklin? Can't we find a time for them? Also, I won't be able
to go to his reception at a hotel since I have to go to the screening for the Nat Geo
special so that day doesn't work so well. What about on the 26th after T get back from NY
since gill will be in Haiti and could come back to DC?

Here is my quick take on the results -- see below. It's 1994 all over again -- that's for sure. Brilliant of you to be
thousands of miles away from this.
No Tea Party for the Tea Party
But Obama must heed the message of exit polls
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772860 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772860 Date: 08/31/2015
By Mark Penn
Without doubt the tea Party will be rejoicing at the results and laying down ultimatums to the Republican Party
to steer to the right, and the Republican Party having embraced the Tea party will be hard pressed to say "no" to the
new right wing in America.
Poll after poll shows that the Tea Party is really a splinter of the Republican Party, and the exit polls show that
this was a vote about the economy, not ideology. Only 23% of the voters said that they were casting a vote for the Tea
Party while 56% said it was not a factor and the rest outright opposed them.
But 62% of the voters said that the economy was the key factor determining their vote. The polls show that the
voters want tax cuts not tax increases, modification or repeal of healthcare, spending cuts and above all jobs.
With healthcare reform, cap and trade bills, and tax increases, President Obama got out of step with the voters.
Why he didn't just kick the Bush tax cuts down the road a year and get them out of the election cycle is mystifying.
Instead -- just like in 1994 -- the Democrats ran on the platform of increasing taxes for the wealthy, amplifying class
warfare rather than ending it.
Whoever told President Obama "don't worry, just pass healthcare and they will love it" must be squirming in his
seat tonight. And all those who think that tacking further to the left is the answer for the Democrats should look at these
results carefully and think again.
President Obama and the Democrats lost many of the new constituencies they had won in 2008 -- they lost
independents by 15 per cent in the CNN exit poll. Obama had won them by 8 points. They lost seniors by 16 points,
doubling the loss from 8 points while seniors turned out in droves. And they lost voters in households making over
$100,000 by 16 points, compared to an even split in 2008, evidence of the damage of the reinvigorated class warfare
strategy. These are all battleground voting blocks that Obama had done well enough with to trounce McCain.
And the two other core constituencies of President Obama -- young voters and minorities -- stayed home, with
their percentage of the vote dropping dramatically. In the end the Republicans and the Tea Party won the turnout war
and those differences are also a major factor in the outcome. 41% of the voters were conservative, up from 34% in the
2008 presidential election. Only 11% of the voters were aged 18 to 29 compared to 18% in the presidential election.
These results are just plain facts, and the President needs to stand up and take notice. The voters are rejecting
the current course and have thrown up a major roadblock to his policies.
But this does not mean that the voters want to gut Medicare, Medicaid, Education or the Environment. They
don't want the government shut down; they want it fully open for business. Above all, they want jobs, and they are
willing to vote for any party they believe may have the answer to the presidential election. Nancy Pelosi became the
poster child of the left and became the target of the Republican right. They scored a bulls eye on her, but all glory is
fleeting. The burden will be on the Republicans now to be a responsible handbrake -- if they again shut down the
government they will lose the public's trust and support very quickly.
If President Obama wants to serve a second term, he will have to heed the call to recalibrate his administration.
He was elected as a centrist. They want him to be one. He was elected as a youthful, vigorous candidate who would
lead us into a more global future. They want him to do just that. He was elected to end, not amplify partisanship.
President Clinton turned his White House around from a similar defeat in 1994. President Obama faces the same
choices and opportunities to remain true to democratic values and yet set a new direction to turn all this around.

The Argentina desk is working this issue on your behalf. They will be in touch with the sender of the letter (Mr. Ramer in
California). The letter asks you to enter into a bilateral agreement with Argentina in order to rectify a Locally Employed
Staffer's (in Argentina) personal tax predicament. I'm happy to call Brian too, if you like.

WikiLeaks Accidentally Helps U.S.
by Leslie H. Gelb
November 30, 2010 I 10:42pm
Julian Assange clearly intended the State Dept. cable leaks to smear the U.S. as evil and selfish. Leslie H. Gelb on how he
inadvertently proved the opposite.
The Wikileakers dumped a vast pile of secrets <http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-11-28/wikileaks-
documents-chinas-google-hack-un-spying-more-secrets/> to prove that the United States was selfish, stupid and
wicked—but their revelations proved just the opposite. When you remove the gossip and obvious trivia that mesmerized
the press, you clearly see what the Wikileakers never expected: A United States seriously and professionally trying to
solve the most dangerous problems in a frighteningly complicated world, yet lacking the power to dictate solutions. U.S.
policymakers and diplomats are shown, quite accurately, doing what they are supposed to do: ferreting out critical
information from foreign leaders, searching for paths to common action, and struggling with the right amount of
pressure to apply on allies and adversaries. And in most cases, the villain is not Washington, but foreign leaders escaping
common action with cowardice and hypocrisy.
Don't think for a New York minute that Julian Assange, the Wikileaker, unloaded this trove to save humankind. Why did
he toss in those cables about Italy's leader being a rake and Germany's chancellor being a cautious fuddy-duddy, and
President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan being "paranoid"? To save the world? Not a chance. He did it to get attention,
and he got attention from a drooling press, which then went on to call the very material they were highlighting trivial.
Did Assange leak critical conversations with Chinese or Arab leaders to help solve the problems in Korea and Iran? Not

hopeless left-wing ideologue knows that such leaks will crush future serious conversations with those leaders for some
time to come. Just think: if you told someone a serious and critical confidence about someone else, and your confidant
went out and told others, would you soon repeat that mistake? Assange did not leak these cables to help solve world
problems. These leaks were absolutely gratuitous and served only the purpose of making him a media marvel.
When you actually read the cables, here's what you see: American leaders and American diplomats trying to solve
crucial world In explaining his deed publicly, Assange suggests that what he's doing is uncovering American misdeeds
and lies. His aim, he says, is to inform citizens of democracies and peoples around the world about what their leaders
are really doing. Assange also insists he did this for transparency's sake. Yet when he got to look inside, he didn't see
what was plain: that our diplomats were doing a good job. Indeed, when you turn off his nonsense and stop listening to
the strange commentary on cable news and even on the front pages of great newspapers, when you actually read the
cables, here's what you see: American leaders and American diplomats trying to solve crucial world problems.

—Washington needs China's help in bolstering sanctions against Iran, and China balks for fear of jeopardizing its oil and
gas flow from that country. The Obama team arranges for Saudi Arabia to guarantee any loss in supply to China. If the
world wants to slow or even prevent Iran's march to nuclear weaponry, this is a key path to doing so.
—The U.S. discovers that North Korea has manufactured new medium-range missiles and is trying to deliver them to Iran
through China. The Obama team discovers this, informs Beijing, and asks Beijing to stop the transfer. Beijing declines.
Really creepy.
—
Yemen's leader takes public responsibility for American missile attacks against Al Qaeda in Yemen. He wants to
diminish the power of these terrorists, as do Americans and most others in the world. The "lie" by the Yemeni president
is a harmless way to get a critical job done—that is, the job of fighting international terrorism. Wikileaks tears away the
political cover of Yemen's leaders.
—
No country has anywhere near as much influence over nutty North Korea as China. So, U.S. diplomats are searching
desperately to figure out Chinese thinking about North Korea in order to compose a plan for avoiding war on the Korean
Peninsula. So, the Wikileakers expose some Chinese leaders who are actually trying to give us some insight into Chinese
thinking about North Korean craziness. They won't do that again soon.
Time and again, as one actually reads these cables, one has to be heartened by the professionalism and the insights of
U.S. diplomats. What are they doing? They are not lying, and U.S. leaders are not lying. They are actually, believe it or
not, trying to solve problems. That seriousness of purpose and the professionalism to execute it is what jumps out at you
in these materials.
So, the naïve say, it's good to show the effectiveness of our diplomats. Give me a break. Ask any American diplomat to
choose between looking intelligent in leaked cables and making progress toward avoiding war.
None of this is to say that there should not be leaks, or that the press should not pursue classified information that is
necessary or very helpful to a sensible public debate on policy. If a U.S. administration is lying, or distorting the facts, or
telling one story to the public and another to itself, then by all means, let's have it out in public. If the U.S. government is
concocting intelligence in order to justify wars, let's hope an enterprising reporter finds it out for the rest of us.
But the Wikileaks dump is not about providing essential information to Americans or to others—information they need
for serious policy discussion. This massive trashing by Wikileaks of a legitimate effort by the U.S. government to preserve
confidentiality is the very least a shame and at the most, a crime.

Richard Holbrooke was a piece of work. He was a paradoxical man: a remarkably subtle thinker capable of the most
egregious lack of subtlety, a brilliant diplomat with one of the least diplomatic temperaments anybody ever
encountered. He was always cunning but never malevolent. Mentally, he was sleepless, relentlessly pondering the
meanings of even the most trivial events and experiences. (An example: Decades ago Holbrooke was strolling down
Madison Avenue with a friend. A man passed them and said "Hi, Dick". Holbrooke stopped in his tracks, turned to his
friend, and said: "I wonder what he meant by that." Sleepless.) His powers of observation were extraordinary, the
cognitive advantage of his utter extroversion; and they were matched by his massive powers of analysis, which never
shut down. He was a disorderly man with an ordered mind; there was rigorous reflection at the heart of the whirlwind.
He was, almost preposterously, in constant motion, a stranger to calm, a bull in search of a china shop; but in his
thinking, and in his commitment to his country, he was one of the steadiest men on earth.
The legend of his career, and the flamboyance of his person, has obscured a proper recognition of his commitments.
Holbrooke was not only a student of power; he was also a creature of beliefs. What he believed in most of all, I think,
was in the ability, and the duty, of the United States, by a variety of means, to better the world. He was, in his cast of
mind, a realist, but his cast of mind was not his philosophy: this realist—the Democrats' most accomplished
Machiavellian—was always returning to first principles, to moral considerations, to the alleviation of human suffering
and the spread of political liberty as goals of American statecraft. He came away from his early years in Vietnam with
lessons but without a syndrome. He was unanguished about the use of American force, when it was morally justified and
intelligently applied—which is to say, he was the last of the postwar liberals. Even in his most virulent criticism of what
he regarded as America's military mistakes abroad, there was not a trace of the temptation to surrender a high sense of
America's role in history. Isolationism disgusted him. He had a natural understanding, it was almost an attribute of his
character, of the relationship between diplomacy and force. He had no illusions about the harshness of the world, and
therefore about the toughness that is required for the creation of a world less harsh. His last assignment, the
increasingly Sisyphean attempt to bring Afghanistan into the community of open and decent societies, was a bet on this
sober and unsentimental optimism. He cared famously about what worked, and he could be brazen in his pragmatism,
but Holbrooke's professional life was animated by goals and concepts that no mere pragmatist could share. American
interventionism, for him, was not just a policy; it was a way of existing responsibly in the world, the measure of a
national (and personal) ideal, the real greatness of a great power.
It was this rare package of means and ends, of ideas and instruments, that made possible Holbrooke's triumph at
Dayton. He negotiated a peace with a villain whom he deeply despised, and thereby ended a genocide in which we, the
United States, and an administration from his own party, had outrageously acquiesced. In this way he helped to restore
the honor of his country after a period of disgrace. On the day that Holbrooke suffered the cataclysmic collapse from
which he never recovered, The New York Times reported that Henry Kissinger—the Republicans' most accomplished
Machiavellian—remarked in 1973 that "if they put Jews into gas chambers in the Soviet Union, it is not an American
concern. Maybe a humanitarian concern." Such unforgettably filthy words would never have crossed Richard
Holbrooke's lips. In government and out, not least in his groundbreaking work at Refugees International, his career was
a loud and effective refutation of that chilling "maybe."
He was also an intellectual. He edited, he wrote (for my pages, too), he read. He raised a lasting institution of
intellectuality in the American Academy in Berlin. His renowned attraction to journalists was not just a more or less
charming campaign of spin; in his unslakable desire for the latest news and the immediate interpretation of it, he was
one of their company. There was so much about which this genuinely cosmopolitan man did not need to be briefed. He
had an appetite for complexity, though it never crippled him in his practice. It was Holbrooke, more than anybody else,
who focused American planning upon the most disturbing contemporary complexity of all: the grim fact that the pursuit
of our national security in Central Asia depends as much, if not more, upon Pakistan than upon Afghanistan. And after he
edited and wrote and read, and before, and during, he talked. Holbrooke's talk was a kind of rolling chronicle of his
times, a rush of concepts and gossip, brash, probing, impatient, occasionally outrageous, with a fine feeling for absurdity

in the mix—the richest display of his prodigious vitality. He was faster on his feet than anybody I have ever known. It was
a joy, and an amusement, to behold.
We were friends for almost three decades. He was a constant source of fascination-1 had never before encountered
such a union of intrigue and idealism; but mostly he inspired admiration and affection. Now the unstoppable man has
been stopped, and the man who was everywhere is nowhere. If only he could have gotten the angel of death around a
table....
