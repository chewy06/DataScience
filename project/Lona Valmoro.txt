cover, as I have in the past, but, assuming she doesn't want to do it, thought this might be of interest for you. Could also

Subject: Exciting News
Hi Hillary, you are doing an amazing job as our Secretary of State and we are all immensely proud of you.
Really enjoyed your recent remarks regarding Afghanistan. Your words were spot on. Fyi, I will be in Kabul, Afghanistan
from 7 thru 14 April and am being hosted by Flamed Wardak, the son of the Afghanistan Secretary of Defense. Looking
forward to the visit.
There is some exciting personal news that I wanted to share with you. Although it has not yet been announced, I wanted
you to know that I recently interviewed with Cisco President ( John Chambers) and accepted a senior executive position
( effective 4 May ) to be the face and thought leader for Cisco in the field of "Intelligent Urbanization" with my focus
area being on Physical Safety and Security.
My wife (Faith) and I will live in Bangalore, India ( we are very excited ) and my area of responsibility will be the
emerging markets of Asia, Middle East and Africa . Since I will operate from India that particular country will be a major
focal point.
The use of the Network to improve the quality of life of Millions of people in areas such as Education, Health Care and
Security will be a major thrust of " Intelligent Urbanization". Faith and I are pumped up about our new overseas
adventure and the chance to work for a world class company and a superb business leader like John Chambers.
It is really a wonderful opportunity to positively impact many lives around the Globe.
Hope to perhaps call on you for a few minutes before I head over to India.
All the best and God Bless.
Sincerely, Dave

Madam Secretary-
I hope this note finds you and your family doing well. I've been following all of your activities over the last several
months. You are doing an incredible job, which I'm sure is a surprise to no one. I'm going to be in DC May 19-21. We
have our annual gathering out there with about 150 folks coming out from the Exchange. I know this is probably a long
shot at best, but we are having a dinner for our group at the Hay Adams on Tuesday, May 19 and it would be a
tremendous honor if you would come by and say a few words. If this doesn't work but you are in town, I'd love to stop
by for 5 minutes to say hello. Please let me know if any of this is possible. I look forward to seeing you soon.
All my best,

Daniel Yohannes will be in town on Tuesday. Not sure how hectic HRC's day is but would be good to have her get 30
minutes with him. I am going to schedule 30 minutes with him so she can either join or we can tack time on the
backend.
In addition, I am going to connect Steve and Daniel so they can meet in person on Tuesday — I likely will coordinate that
so that Steve joins before or after I meet with Daniel in case HRC wants to see both.

Subject: cairo +15 speech in early january
About six weeks ago, HRC agreed to give a speech commemorating the anniversary of the 1994 UN Conference on
Population and Development in Cairo. I believe the actual anniversary is December 18th so frankly, if we did the
speech in early January, we would not be that far off the mark. The idea would be to do this speech at State with the
audience including the NGOs, Gates Foundation, UN, and Packard Foundations. This speech could send a message
regarding the link between population and environmental sustainability and as a result, improve women's status and
rights. I would love to give them January 6th-8th if that works on your end.

For Secretary Clinton
Dear Hillary,
You will remember our initiative to bring the most senior retired generals from the Chinese and US militaries. With
these 10 generals from the two countires, I am going to be in DC on October 21 and 22. these Generals have been part
our of our Sanya Initiative - the unofficial mil-mil dialogue I started last year. It'll be me, Joe Prueher, Charley Wilhelm,
Ron Fogleman, and Denny Reimer. The Chinese will be led by General Xiong Guangkai and include four other very senior
and respected Generals from the PLA.
The Chinese view this as a formal track one program and take it very seriously. We will meet with ADM Mullen and ADM
Keating in Honolulu and see GEN Cartwright at the Pentagon. It would be a terrific sign of the U.S.'s support for this
relationship if you were able join or host (I'd be pleased to fund) a very private dinner on the evening of the 21 or the
22nd of October. Just you, the Generals, and interpreters - perhaps the Chinese Ambassador if you think that would be
valuable.

I met with Kurt Campbell last month, and we will meet with him and Jim Steinberg. He expressed strong support for this
dialogue as well as the economic one we started in Beijing last August. You know we would welcome involvement from
State at any of our projects - our goal is to make a small but meaningful difference in the relationship.

On another note I wanted to send congratulations to you on the announcement of your daughters engagement. Iknow
you are proud of her and rightfully so.
Also I had dinner last night with a mutual friend of ours, Sen Lindsay Graham. Lindsay always talks how much he likes

Stay well and I look forward to hearing and seeing you soon.

to accept this invite but haven't been able to nail down. We will let you know one way or the other by end of next week.
Is that ok?
I hope you, your family and the futures markets are all well! My very best wishes, Hillary

Madam Secretary-
I hope you, the President and Chelsea had a great Thanksgiving. Hopefully things will wind down and you'll be able to
spend some time with your family. As you know, I'm being honored by the American Friends of the Hebrew University
on Thursday, March 11, 2010. I'd be so honored if you would consider being the keynote speaker. I've had some
correspondence with Lona in your office and she indicated you may have a better idea of your 2010 calendar in early
November. It would mean the world to me if you could do it, but if not I completely understand.
I look forward to seeing you soon.
All my best,
Terry

Dear all:
To update you, at G we have been working on water and World Water Day (the event planned takes place at the
National Geographic Building), since I am taking on water as the key issue I am/will working on. I sent S a memo on
water in December outlining our plans. Note that we are mandated to report to Congress annually as part of the "Water
for the Poor" Act.
I have met with Kerri-Ann, with OES "water" staff in the last weeks to address this and also with several regional bureau
A/S (Carson, Feltman, Blake so far) on water in the respective regions.
There is a great deal of interest on their part and we have started outlining specific initiatives that we could focus on.
We've also met on the Nile Basin Initiative, with World Bank "experts" leading NGOs, McKinsey, etc. I've also spoken to
Raj (USAID allocated about $480 million in FY 2009 to water, and MCC about $500 million) but of course he has been
unable to focus on this. And Cheryl and I haven't spoken yet about Food Security/water.

Happy New Year. I hope you got some time to enjoy the holiday season and could relax before getting back at it this
year.
Andy Young is a very good friend of mine, and has been a stalwart for the Clintons over the years. He is also one of the
most recognized and respected experts on Africa in America. He asked me today if I thought it would be appropriate for
him to seek to see the Secretary to share some of his thoughts on Africa and current issues being confronted there. I
told him of course and suggested that he reach out to you to try to arrange that dialogue. Hopefully that is ok from your
perspective. Andy is a thoughtful, remarkable and decent man. If you don't know him you will enjoy getting to know
him. Thanks and maybe one of these days when I am in DC we can grab a coffee together. Cheers.

My update from this list:
Sandy Levin will be this week, working on the other Hill appointments and will get Walter I. in as soon as possible.
Staff retreat -- Idon't believe we could use Blair House on the 14th but Huma will remember better than me. The 28th
is the Friday before Memorial Day weekend, not sure if people have plans that would interfere?
I will follow up on Vietnam symposium and Idid call Reyes' office but never heard back so will try again tomorrow.

Here are a few odds and ends:
Since I'm going to the Bahrain Manama Conf in December, I want to decide where else I might go. The. climate conf in
Mexico will be held Nov 29-Dec 10. There is also a Dec 10 conf on trafficking in Luxor sponsored by Mrs. Mubarak that
Melanne hopes I could attend.
Add to list of meetings the following--
Ron Kirk
Hilda Solis
Walter Isaacson—high priority
Sandy Levin
Loretta Sanchez
Max Baucus
Eliot Engel
Ben Cardin wants me to come give a speech about the 35th anniversary of the Helsinki Accords on the Hill so I thought If
I'm going back to Helsinki for a speech about the Helinski Accords in July maybe I should do the Hill speech around that
time.
Also, Cheryl wants a staff retreat/meeting so what about May 14 or 28?
Did you get info about the Vietnam symposium the State historian, Carland, invited me to open on 9/29?
I want to plan to go to the Arctic Council in Greenland next April.

I'd love to invite the Secretary. Is that even proper protocol? Although she probably couldn't attend, I'd like to share it

Sidney
On a rainy, gloomy Sunday I write to you in the hope that we will have agreement from Secretary Clinton to accept the
"distinguished Diplomat" award at VMI. I am assured by the Superintendent, General JHB Peay, and the department
head of International Relations/Political Science, Colonel Jim Hentz that the award is hers if she will accept it. This is a
"done deal."
All that is needed for her to receive an official letter from General Peay is for me to know that she will accept the award.
They want to give her the award this year on a suitable day before graduation in late May. The letter will ask her to
address the corps of cadets in a suitable on post (campus) setting. I would like to see it in Jackson Memorial Hall, a
beautiful medieval revival building. An alternative setting would be the two story atrium in the Marshall Center for

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769471 Date: 08/31/2015
Leadership and Ethics. The award would be presented at the end of the address. Media coverage would be welcomed
and assisted. She would be honored by being the reviewing person at a regimental review of the corps. A suitable
dinner and or luncheon would be arranged.
If this is going to happen it would be a good idea to set the wheels in motion as soon as possible so that the staffs can
work out the details.

Hi Lona, I just saw the S video for Mother's Day: After nearly 10 years of working for the Department, this ranks as one
of my proudest, most fulfilling moments of serving as a Foreign Service Officer.
Clearly I'm not the only one who has made these sacrifices or who has these frustrations; Secretary Clinton has heard
our struggles (indeed has gone through her own struggles as a professional mom!), and she truly gets it.
I just wanted to tell somebody, and I remembered your name from the women's conference in December. Forgive this
long message. Happy Mother's Day, and congratulations on working with such an incredible person.
Regards,
Kristin

Hooray. 30th looks great (have to go to Edie's on the 29th for Gillibrand, but I can meet you after if that's better).
My other updates are:
With Gina, I'm hosting one of several dinner parties to welcome the new SEIU prez (yes a bit of an unstated message) to
women leaders. I think Wendy S and Judy L are doing the others. It's another of Gina's great ideas.
And we're holding a fundraiser for Bennet on the 27th that is looking really good.
Finally, I did a brief intv with a Center for Public Service rep for their regular feature in the Post abt compelling leaders in
the federal govnt. And this one will be about Kate Beale!
Oh, and after confirming to do so with PIR, did a quickie recalling the thoroughly positive vibes and experiences of you
and Laura Bush to our pal at Politico!!
Finally, finally, and hope I didn't say this already, I started yesterday am sending an anniversary greeting and ode to
Team 9-11 Clinton to everyone there when we waited for you to come in (for the Mrs. Bush testimony coincidentally)

and watched the 2nd plane, and of course the rest was our amazing journey together of work to be so proud of. I even
included Ramon on the chain!!! Impossible it now seems.
Done blabbing. Have a restful Sunday. Everyone, and I mean everyone despite what I recall about some, is singing your
praises.

I'm all updated now! So, I will offer up some dates and you will pick the place for a catchup dinner--sounds like a deal!
