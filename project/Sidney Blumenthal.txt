highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1.On September 12, 2012 Libyan President Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf told senior
advisors that the death of the U.S. Ambassador at the hands of Islamist militia forces represents a
threat to the future of the newly elected General National Congress (GNC) Government According to
a sensitive source, el Magariaf believes that the primary goal of this and other attacks on Western
facilities is to demonstrate that the GNC cannot protect its non-Islamic friends. Libyan security
officials believe that the attack was carried out by forces of the Islamist militia group calling itself the
Ansar al Sharia brigade; working out of camps in the Eastern suburbs of Benghazi. These officials
added that their sources indicate that this group is led by former members of the old Libyan Islamic
Fighting Group (LIFG), some of whom are loyal to Islamist General Abdelhakirn Belhaj. The same
officials were quick to point out that they have no evidence that Belhaj had any direct involvement in
this attack. They also have no direct information as to whether this assault has anything to do with
the death of Libyan born al Qai'da leader Abu Yahya al- Libi, but they are pursuing this theme. These
officials do believe that the attackers having prepared to launch their assault took advantage of the
cover provided by the demonstrations in Benghazi protesting an internet production seen as
disrespectful to the prophet Mohammed.
2. According to this source, the immediate events were set in motion by a statement made by a
Muslim Cleric in Egypt saying that the internet film was going to be shown across the United States
on September 11 in an effort to insult Muslims on the anniversary of the attacks on the New York
World Trade Center in 2001. This statement inspired increasingly hostile demonstrations at the U.S.

Embassy in Cairo, and at diplomatic facilities in Libya. In Benghazi, reporting from security sources
states, approximately twenty one (21) Ansar al Sharia fighters left their base in East Benghazi just
after sundown infiltrated the crowd of about 2,000 demonstrators at the U.S. Consulate. These
forces, operating under cover of darkness, opened fire on the consulate, eventually setting it on fire
with rocket propelled grenades. These fighters then withdrew to their camp. El Magariaf ordered
security officials to identify and arrest the attackers, adding that he had been in touch with Egyptian
President Mohmmed Morsi, and the two agreed that their intelligence and security personnel will
cooperate in this matter. (Note: Some of the Libyan officials believe that the entire demonstration was
organized as cover for the attack, however; they point out that there is no evidence of such a complex
operation at this time.
3. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Libyan security officers also informed
el Magariaf that the attacks had been planned for approximately one month, based on casing
information obtained during an early demonstration at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. The attackers
were, in the opinion of these individuals, looking for an opportunity to approach the consulate under
cover in a crowd. These officials add that government security officers admitted to el Magariaf that
they do not have the physical capacity to locate, attack, and destroy the Ansar al-Sharia brigade,
among others. They describe these forces as well-trained, hardened killers; many of whom have spent
time in Afghanistan and Yemen. These fighters are located in camps in Eastern Libya; and Libyan
officials doubt they can penetrate these camps because the militia's are better armed than the forces
of the new National Army.
4. In the opinion of a separate source El Magariaf continues to believe that the attacks were
planned and carried out in a political atmosphere where a portion of the Libyan population is focused
on past cooperation between Western intelligence and security services, and the regime of former
dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. According to this source, el Magariaf realizes that the death of the U.S.
Ambassador dictates that he must find tangible solutions to the problems tied to disarming the
militias, dealing Salafist violence against the followers of Sufi beliefs, and efforts to discredit his
government through linking him to Western intelligence services. El Magariaf instructed his security
officials to cooperate with their U.S. counterparts. He also warned all of his advisors to be prepared
for U.S. retaliation against the suspected perpetrators of this attack, and the angry public reaction that
is sure to follow.
5. (Source Comment: A separate, particularly sensitive source added. that in private
conversation el Magariaf stated that if his government cannot protect a senior diplomatic official,
foreign businesses will not be willing to risk opening up new operations in Libya. According to this
sensitive source, el Magariaf believes that a number of the Islamist militias are now being influenced
al Qai'da and other radical groups; working out of camps in the Eastern and Southeastern parts of the
country. These groups are receiving aid and weapons from supporters in Sudan. In the end, el
Magariaf added that while he does not expect U.S. officials to focus on this point, he believes the
attacks against the interests and citizens of the U.S. and other Western states are aimed first at
overthrowing his government, and replacing it with a strict Islamic Republic dominated by Salafist
leaders. Magariaf also warned that tribal militias loyal to the Qaddafi family continue to present an
equally dangerous threat to the new Government.)

GOP's October surprise?
They're calling it the "Jimmy Carter Strategy": Exploit
Libya attack to paint Obama as weak on terrorism
By cY'aia?,_
(Credit: AP/AI Behrman/Salort)
According to a highly reliable source, as Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama prepare for the
first presidential debate Wednesday night, top Republican operatives are primed to unleash a new
two-pronged offensive that will attack Obama as weak on national security, and will be based, in part,
on inW !ia:en,y-.3iTeForrnation regarding the attacks in Libya that killed U.S. ambassador Chris
Stevens on September
The source, who has first-hand knowledge of private, high-level conversations in the Romney tamp
that took place in Washington, DC last week, said that at various times the GOP strategists referred to
their new operation as the Jimmy Carter Strategy or the October Surprise.
He added that they planned to release what they hoped would be "a bombshell" that would make
Libya and Obama's foreign policy a major issue in the campaign. "My understanding is that they have
come up with evidence that the Obama administration had positive intelligence that there was going
to be a terrorist attack on the intelligence."
The source described the Republicans as chortling with glee that the Obama administration
"definitely had intel" about the attack before it happened. "Intelligence can be graded in different
ways," he added, "and sometimes A and B don't get connected. But [the Romney campaign] will try to
paint it to look like Obama had advance knowledge of the attack and is weak on terrorism."
He said they were jubilant about their new strategy and said they intended to portray Obama as a
helpless, Jimmy Carter-like president and to equate the tragedy in Libya with President Carter's failed
attempt to rescue American hostages in Iran in t980. "They are so excited about it," he said. "Over
and over again they talked about bow it would be just like Jimmy Carter's failed raid. They feel it is
going to give them .a last-minute landslide in the election."
The source, however, said lie was dubious about the tactic. "To me, it is indicative that they have lost
touch with a huge portion of the electorate," he said.
The source declined to reveal the names of the GOP operatives who were present. But he said, "These
were the top guys in the party. It was a .private, unguarded planning conversation." He further

described participants in the meeting as consisting of well-known names tied to the big Republican
super PACs and people who had access to high-level national security intelligence.
"As usual, Karl Rove wasn't present," he said, "but some were close to Rove."
The source said that "there was quite a bit more" to the operation than simply revealing the
intelligence regarding Libya. He declined to discuss what he described as the second phase of the
operation.
However, already there is evidence that the first phase of the operation is underway. On Wednesday,
September 26, on Fox News, Karl Rove called Obama's reaction to what happened in Libya
"inexplicable" and added that Obama is "more intent on campaigning than meeting his
responsibilities as commander-in-chief." He went on to warn that Obama's policies in Libya
endangered the U.S. with regard to Iran. "I am astonished," Rove said. "We are projecting weakness
when we need to be projecting strength."
Similarly, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a one-time GOP presidential hopeful who
became known as the mayor of 9/11, followed Rove in criticizing Obama on the attack in Libya. "This
is a deliberate attempt to cover up the truth, from an administration that claimed it wanted to be the
most transparent in history," he told Fox News. "And it's the worst kind of cover-up: the kind of
cover-up that involves our national security. This is a cover-up that involves the slaughter of four
Americans."
Giuliani added that the Obama White House wanted to dismiss the role played by al-Qaeda because it
seemed to diminish the triumph of having killed Osama bin Laden. "I think it's because they have this
narrative that they defeated al-Qaeda," he said. "They never say the words 'Islamic fundamentalist
terrorism'. They want to wish it away. The president was moving on to Asia — he was going to declare
this a great victory for himself and unfortunately, this terrible act of terror intervened in their very
convenient narrative."
Likewise, Bob Corker, Republican senator from Tennessee, described the administration's response to
"the terrorist attack" in Libya as And on Sunday, September 30, both Mitt Romney and
vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan joined in the attacks. "I think they want to do their very best to
keep the people of America from understanding exactly what happened. We expect candor, we expect
transparency, particularly as it relates to terrorism," Romney said.
Added Ryan, "Why is he (Obama) not on the same page with his own administration officials who are
saying that this is a terrorist attack? We'll leave it up to you to decide whether it's a cover-up or not."
In an apparently related development, a Politico artkle posted last night said Romney advisers were
divided over hovv aggressively to attack President Obama over his handling of the events in Libya. One
unnamed Romney adviser described them as "a huge gift" to the campaign. "Across the board —
domestic, economic and foreign-policy issues — President Obama has been outmatched by events," he
said. "He's an observer of events, not a shaper of events. Everywhere you look, he's been outmatched."
But other Romney advisers, led by media strategist Stuart Stevens, wanted to stick to the economy as
the central issue. "They'll tell you that you've got to focus people on the fact that their economic
prospects are not very good and all that," the aide told Politico. "Well, Romney's been trying to do that
now since he clinched the nomination at the end of April — and he's failed. The president is better at
deflecting attention from the bad news than Romney is at driving home the impact of the bad news on
individual voters."

Romney has an op-ed in today's Wall Street Journal playing off Stevens' murder to say Obama has put
"security at risk," etc.
According to Politico yesterday, there was an internal argument within the Romney campaign over
Libya. Obviously, the neocons and the Rove oriented faction (Ed Gillespie, Rove's surrogate is now a
Romney campaign adviser) beat Stuart Stevens.
Romney is careening from tactic to tactic, hoping something will catch.
I wouldn't be surprised to see Romney raise the specter of the Muslim Brotherhood in charge of Egypt
& Libya as a bogeyman. I have heard him do this within the last week.

Re: Morsi's private conversations & coordination with Magariaf
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
I. Late in the day on September 14, 2012, Egyptian President Mohamad Morsi told senior
European diplomats that he is increasingly concerned the current anti-U.S. and anti-Western violence
spreading through Cairo and into the rest of Egypt may be part of an effort by his Salafist political
rivals to destabilize his government, which many of them believe is too moderate in its positions
regarding Islam, Israel, and the non-Muslim world. According to this source, Morsi, who is in
Brussels for meetings with the European Union (EU), was particularly concerned over a message from
Army commander General Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, that Islamist guerrillas, believed to be drawn
primarily from the Sawarki Bedouin tribe, had launched an attack on a base of the International
Peacekeeping Force (IPF) in the Sinai. The General reported that the 1500 United Nations troops at
the base, including some U.S. forces, were under heavy attack and casualty figures were not yet
known. Morsi stated that this fight was an example of radical anti-government forces and Salafist
Islamist dissidents taking advantage of the current situation to carry out attacks that demonstrate his
government is unable to protect Western personnel and facilities in Egypt. Morsi stated that the
success or failure of his regime is directly tied to his ability to establish a moderate Islamic state that
can work with western business interests.
2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, the current wave of violence is related
to an ongoing struggle between Salafist and Sufi Muslims throughout Egypt. What makes it more
frustrating for Morsi is that much of the violence appears to be inspired by members of the Salafist al
Nour Party, the coalition partner of Morsi's Freedom and Justice Party (RIP) in the new Egyptian
Parliament. According to this individual, Morsi delayed condemning the initial attacks on the U.S.

Embassy out of concern that his opponents would use such a statement to move against his
government. Late on the evening of September 13, 2012, Mohammed Badie, the Supreme Guide of
the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood (MB), sent a message to Morsi warning that he and the Supreme
Guidance Council were concerned that the situation around the U.S. Embassy was getting out of
control and that, difficult as it might seem, he had to take tough measures against the demonstrators,
and protect the interests of the U.S. and other Western Governments. In a telephone discussion with
Saad al-Katany, the MB/Freedom and Justice Party (MB/KIP) Speaker of the lower house of
parliament, Morsi admitted that he had felt constrained from acting, given his past history of poor
personal relations with the leaders of al Nour. Al-Katany urged him to gain control of the situation.)
3. On September 14, Morsi also stated to an EU official that he had received extremely forceful
messages from both the U.S. State Department and the Office of the U.S. President, leaving no doubt
in his mind that the U.S. —Egyptian relations and more than $1billion in U.S. aid were at stake in this
matter. Morsi added that since much of this aid goes to the Egyptian Army, he and al-Katany agreed
that actions that put it in jeopardy would also damage the new Egyptian administration's current
good relationship with the Army. Accordingly, Morsi instructed the military and security forces to use
all necessary force short of lethal measures to protect U.S. and Western facilities. In a private
conversation, Morsi stated that he felt he is losing control of the political situation and fears that if the
current fighting results in deaths, either of demonstrators, U.S. diplomats, Egyptian security
personnel, or UN peacekeepers, the situation may spin out of control and his government could fall.
Al-Katany agreed, but said that taking no action would guarantee disaster. They agreed that when the
situation calms down they will have to deal with the al Nour party, which they fear will, in the future,
take advantage of circumstances to try to destabilize Morsi's administration. With this in mind, Morsi
ordered al-Sissi to direct the commanders of Military Intelligence (MI -Mukhabarat el-Khabeya) to
step up operations collecting information on the activities of the al Nour leadership, focusing on any
contacts with potentially violent Salafist dissidents.
4. (Source Comment: A separate sensitive source also noted that General al-Sissi is warning
Morsi about press reports that the person who made the controversial internet film at the heart of this
situation is an Egyptian Coptic Christian. The General cautioned that as this report gains wider
circulation, the government and the Army must prepare for violent attacks by Islamists against that
community, which makes up ten (10) percent of the Egyptian population.)
5. A separate sensitive source noted that for his part, al-Sissi is prepared to to have his troops
take harsh measures against any demonstrators who attack Western personnel and facilities. The
General is also concerned that the al Nour leaders are even more dangerous than Morsi realizes, and
he has ordered the MI to increase technical and physical surveillance of these individuals. In
addition, he stated in private that Morsi and al-Katany spoke with Libyan President Mohammed
Yussef el Ma.gariaf, and they had all agreed that military and security officials in Egypt and Libya will
cooperate in an effort to track links between the violence in Cairo and Benghazi. Al-Sissi has ordered
Special Forces units to step up patrols in the Egypt-Libya border region, while the MI will monitor
communications between dissidents; primarily Salafists, in both countries. According to this source
the General is convinced that these dissidents are seizing the opportunity presented by the current
unrest to move against the governments of Morsi and al-Magariaf. He also received permission from
Morsi to step up cooperation with his counterparts in the U.S. and Western Europe to deal with this
situation and al-Sissi believes al-Magariaf has given similar instructions to Libyan military and
security officials.
6. (Source Comment: According to a separate sensitive source, al-Sissi believes that, given his
new orders from Mori, the Army can, for the most part, protect Western facilities and personnel in
Egypt. But the General is concerned that the security services can never completely eliminate the

Re: Libya cabinet politics
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. As of October 5, 2012 Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf, the new interim President of Libya
told senior advisors that the abortive efforts to form a cabinet under new Prime Minister Mustafa
Abushagur represent the first step in the next phase of the struggle for control of the new Libyan
Government. According to a sensitive source Magariaf is concerned that Abushagur, supported by the
Muslim Brotherhood's (MB) Justice and Construction Party (jCP), as well as certain of the other
more traditional Islamist groups, is looking to establish day to day administrative control the new
government while defining Magariaf as a ceremonial Head of State.
2. According to this individual, the President, who is not affiliated with a particular party
holding seats in the General National Council (GNC), spoke with the new Prime Minister immediately
after Abushagur was elected by the GNC on September 12. At that time Magariaf advised him to
include in his government members of former Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril's National Forces
Alliance (NFA), Abushagar having only narrowly defeated Jibril in the GNC vote. At that time
Magariaf was not aware of the fact that Jibril had already demanded 9 cabinet seats for the NFA;
however, he did point out that even Jibril's more moderate followers were committed to the idea of a
modern Islamic state and would fit into the new cabinet . The President came away from this

discussion with the impression that Abushagur and his supporters intend to marginalize Jibril and
the 39 Members of Parliament (MP) controlled by the NFA, concentrating instead on working with
the 120 independent MPs in the GNC, looking to establish a more conservative administration. This
individual added that Abushagur made it clear that while the President was free to choose his Vice
President and staff, the Prime Minister would choose the national cabinet, supported by the GNC.
3. (Source Comment: According to this individual, Magariaf is allowing the current crisis in
the Abushagur administration to play out without direct interference. He is convinced that the desire
of the Libyan people for peace and stability, which brought him to power, added to the need to
balance the regional and political rivalries throughout the country, will lead to the formation of a
cabinet that is acceptable to all parties. Magariaf also believes that these developments will eventually
leave him as the dominant figure in the government.)
4. In addition, this individual added that Magariaf is seized with the national security
situation, the ongoing effort to disarm militia units, and the investigation of the murder of the United
States Ambassador. All of these efforts are related to what he sees as his most important role,
rebuilding the confidence of the international business community in its ability to operate in Libya
safely and efficiently. To this end he does agree with Abushagur that it is important to replace the
cabinet of former Prime Minister Abdel Rahman el-Keib, particularly Minister of Oil Abdulrahman
Ben Yazza, whose connections to the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi, and the Italian
Oil firm ENI made him unacceptable to the JCP and other conservative parties. That said, this
individual notes that Magariaf was surprised and not pleased with the appointment to the ministry of
Mabrouk Issa Abu Harroura, another technical expert, who previously worked for Libya's Zueitina Oil
Company as well as in the oil sector abroad. Magariaf feels that Abu Harroura does not have the
standing among the foreign oil companies that Ben Yezza enjoyed, although he was more acceptable
to a number of the conservative members of the GNC.
5. Magariaf was pleased that the Prime Minister, after dramatic confrontations with MPs and
demonstrators who entered the GNC chamber, withdrew his cabinet nominations. The President
again advised Abushagur to name former Oil and Finance Minister Ali Tarhouni to the Oil Ministry
post; however, he fears that that Ali Tarhouni is seen as too close to Western governments to gain
acceptance in the GNC. Magariaf is concerned that, while the new cabinet Abushagur plans to put
forward on October 7 may contain some members of the NFA and other moderate groups, it will still
be dominated by the JCP and conservative elements, and will again fail to gain acceptance, leading to
a real government crisis.

6. According to this individual Magariaf and his advisors knew in advance that more than loo
protesters planned to enter the GNC session on October 4, in an effort to prevent MPs from convening
to vote on the new cabinet. While Magariaf did not directly influence these protesters he did nothing
to warn or advise Abushagur on the developing situation In particular, the protestors objected to the
failure of the Prime Minister to name any minister from the Zawiya region. Although the
demonstrators eventually left the hall, a number of the independent MPs, who had said they would
support the new cabinet, were shaken by the incident and changed their positions. In the end,
according to this individual, Abushagur's efforts to rally their support failed, and he was forced to
withdraw all of the nominees, promising to submit a new list on October 7, one that would take into
account regional and political considerations.
7. In the opinion of a particularly sensitive source, the failure of Abushagur to name any NFA
ministers to the new cabinet will continue to complicate the matter. For his part Magariaf is
concerned over international perceptions regarding the nature of the new Libyan government. In this
regard, he fears that the Western press is too sharply focused on the fact that the NFA holds the
largest single bloc of votes in the GNC (38), missing the fact that the real power in the parliament lies
with the 120 independent deputies, who tend to be somewhat conservative on religious and social
matters, while focusing primarily on local political issues. Magariaf believes that the appointment of
All Tarhouni, or another liberal not associated with the NFA, would serve to reassure Western
business and government leaders while demonstrating political balance to the Libyan people.
Although he continues to make this point, the President has no indication that Abushagur will follow
his advice. He does expect Abushagur to again select a majority of cabinet ministers associated with
the MB and the JCP.
8. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Magariaf will remain focused on the security
situation, particularly as he is having some success disarming the militias following the death of the U.S.
Ambassador. According to this individual, Magariaf believes he must end the power of the regional militia
forces before the Libyan economy can improve. The President knows that foreign companies are the key to
Libyan oil production, but he fears that they will not increase their commitment to Libya until the government
can insure the security of their personnel and facilities. In a final note, this individual added that the Italian
goverment is stepping up its activities in Libya, and the President expects them to pressure to Abushagur
appoint an individual like Ben Yezza to the Oil Ministry, where he can favor ENI and other Italian firms.)

President again advised Abushagur to name former Oil and Finance Minister Ali Tarhouni to the
Oil Ministry post; however, he fears that that Ali Tarhouni is seen as too close to Western
governments to gain acceptance in the GNC. Magariaf is concerned that, while the new cabinet
Abushagur plans to put forward on October 7 may contain some members of the NFA and other
moderate groups, it will still be dominated by the JCP and conservative elements, and will again
fail to gain acceptance, leading to a real government crisis.
6. According to this individual Magariaf and his advisors knew in advance that more
than 100 protesters planned to enter the GNC session on October 4, in an effort to prevent MPs
from convening to vote on the new cabinet. While Magariaf did not directly influence these
protesters he did nothing to warn or advise Abushagur on the developing situation. In particular,
the protestors objected to the failure of the Prime Minister to name any minister from the Zawiya
region. Although the demonstrators eventually left the hall, a number of the independent MPs,
who had said they would support the new cabinet, were shaken by the incident and changed their
positions. In the end, according to this individual, Abushagur's efforts to rally their support
failed, and he was forced to withdraw all of the nominees, promising to submit a new list on
October 7, one that would take into account regional and political considerations.
7. In the opinion of a particularly sensitive source, the failure of Abushagur to name any
NFA ministers to the new cabinet will continue to complicate the matter. For his part Magariaf
is concerned over international perceptions regarding the nature of the new Libyan government.
In this regard, he fears that the Western press is too sharply focused on the fact that the NFA
holds the largest single bloc of votes in the GNC (38), missing the fact that the real power in the
parliament lies with the 120 independent deputies, who tend to be somewhat conservative on
religious and social matters, while focusing primarily on local political issues. Magariaf believes
that the appointment of Ali Tarhouni, or another liberal not associated with the NFA, would
serve to reassure Western business and government leaders while demonstrating political balance
to the Libyan people. Although he continues to make this point, the President has no indication
that Abushagur will follow his advice. He does expect Abushagur to again select a majority of
cabinet ministers associated with the MB and the JCP.

8. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Magariaf will remain focused on
the security situation, particularly as he is having some success disarming the militias following
the death of the U.S. Ambassador. According to this individual, Magariaf believes he must end
the power of the regional militia forces before the Libyan economy can improve. The President
knows that foreign companies are the key to Libyan oil production, but he fears that they will not
increase their commitment to Libya until the government can insure the security of their
personnel and facilities. In a'final note, this individual added that the Italian government is
stepping up its activities in Libya, and the President expects them to pressure to Abushagur
appoint an individual like Ben Yezza to the Oil Ministry, where he can favor ENI and other
Italian firms.)

Re: Libya cabinet politics

highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. As of October 5, 2012 Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf, the new interim President of Libya
told senior advisors that the abortive efforts to form a cabinet under new Prime Minister Mustafa
Abushagur represent the first step in the next phase of the struggle for control of the new Libyan
Government. According to a sensitive source Magariaf is concerned that Abushagur, supported by the

Muslim Brotherhood's (MB) Justice and Construction Party (JCP), as well as certain of the other
more traditional Islamist groups, is looking to establish day to day administrative control the new
government while defining Magariaf as a ceremonial Head of State.
2. According to this individual, the President, who is not affiliated with a particular party
holding seats in the General National Council (GNC), spoke with the new Prime Minister immediately
after Abushagur was elected by the GNC on September 12. At that time Magariaf advised him to
include in his government members of former Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril's National Forces
Alliance (NFA), Abushagar having only narrowly defeated Jibril in the GNC vote. At that time
Magariaf was not aware of the fact that Jibril had already demanded 9 cabinet seats for the NFA;
however, he did point out that even Jibril's more moderate followers were committed to the idea of a
modern Islamic state and would fit into the new cabinet. The President came away from this
discussion with the impression that Abushagur and his supporters intend to marginalize Jibril and
the 39 Members of Parliament (MP) controlled by the NFA, concentrating instead on working with
the 120 independent MPs in the GNC, looking to establish a more conservative administration. This
individual added that Abushagur made it clear that while the President was free to choose his Vice
President and staff, the Prime Minister would choose the national cabinet, supported by the GNC.
3. (Source Comment: According to this individual, Magariaf is allowing the current crisis in
the Abushagur administration to play out without direct interference. He is convinced that the desire
of the Libyan people for peace and stability, which brought him to power, added to the need to
balance the regional and political rivalries throughout the country, will lead to the formation of a
cabinet that is acceptable to all parties. Magariaf also believes that these developments will eventually
leave him as the dominant figure in the government.)
4. In addition, this individual added that Magariaf is seized with the national security
situation, the ongoing effort to disarm militia units, and the investigation of the murder of the United
States Ambassador. All of these efforts are related to what he sees as his most important role,
rebuilding the confidence of the international business community in its ability to operate in Libya
safely and efficiently. To this end he does agree with Abushagur that it is important to replace the
cabinet of former Prime Minister Abdel Rahman el-Keib, particularly Minister of Oil Abdulrahman
Ben Yazza, whose connections to the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi, and the Italian
Oil firm ENI made him unacceptable to the JCP and other conservative parties. That said, this
individual notes that Magariaf was surprised and not pleased with the appointment to the ministry of
Mabrouk Issa Abu Harroura, another technical expert, who previously worked for Libya's Zueitina Oil

Company as well as in the oil sector abroad. Magariaf feels that Abu Harroura does not have the
standing among the foreign oil companies that Ben Yezza enjoyed, although he was more acceptable
to a number of the conservative members of the GNC.
5. Magariaf was pleased that the Prime Minister, after dramatic confrontations with MPs and
demonstrators who entered the GNC chamber, withdrew his cabinet nominations. The President
again advised Abushagur to name former Oil and Finance Minister Ali Tarhouni to the Oil Ministry
post; however, he fears that that Ali Tarhouni is seen as too close to Western governments to gain
acceptance in the GNC. Magariaf is concerned that, while the new cabinet Abushagur plans to put

Re: Plans of new Libyan PM
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1.On October 15, 2012, new Lib3.7a Prime Minister Ah Zidan discussed the future structure of
his cabinet and administration with senior advisors to interim President Yussef el Magariaf
According to a sensitive source, Zidan stated that he intends to draw on all sectors of the Libyan
political world to form his cabinet He also advised that while he must proceed with caution he will
have at least one and possibly as many as three members of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) and its
Justice and Construction Party (JCP) included in the cabinet. Zidan believes that he can find
members of the JCP and other Islamist groups who support his plan for establishing a moderate
Islamic state, while maintaining good working relations with the United States and Western Europe.
Zidan also plans to reach out to the supporters of Islamist General Abolel Hakim Alarnin Belhaj, who
he believes can be used as a balance against al Qai'cla in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and Ansar al
Sharia as they attempt to undermine the new administration.
2. In the opinion of this individual Zidan is committed to Magariafs policy of seeking
constructive relationships with international oil companies. In this regard, Zidan is looking for an
individual to serve as Minister of Oil who has the appropriate experience and reputation in the
International Oil industry, while maintaining Islamic credentials that will allow the Minister to work
with the ,JCP and conservative independent members of the General National Congress (GNC). Zidan
believes this will be among his greatest challenges. At the same time, this individual notes that Zidan
has complained that he and Magarial are under pressure from the Mohammed Morsi and the Muslim
Brotherhood Government of Egypt to use Egyptian oil service firms to replace Western firms in
supporting the Libyan oil industry. Zidan is skeptical about this idea, fearing that Libya could become
too dependent on Egypt for technical expertise. He believes that Western firms provide the
opportunity to maintain independence and balance in the oil sector,

3.(Source Comment: In the opinion of this source. Zidan, who served at the Libyan Mission to
India for two years before defecting to the West in 1980, joining Magariaf and his anti- Qaddafl,
National Front for the Salvation of Libya (NFSL), plans to work with all of the parties and groups in
the GNC. At the same time his history gives the Prime Minister a relationship with the President and
a degree of credibility that will be helpful as he forms his cabinet. According to this source, Zidan
wants to move quickly to name a cabinet. His position is also strengthened by the fact that he worked
on behalf of the National Transitional Council (NTC) during the 2011 Civil War, organizing
international support for the rebels. According to this sensitive source, Zidan's immediate concerns
include organizing the investigation of the September 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi,
and the resulting assassination of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Zidan
is already under pressure from the U.S. Government to move the investigation along as quickly as
possible.)
4. In the opinion of this individual Zidan realizes that the attack on the U.S. consulate is now
an international symbol of the security issues at play in Libya, and that the use of pro-government
militias to provide security is not a long term solution to the problem. Zidan believes that the idea
that the government must ask for support from the powerful militias from Misrata and Zintan
undermines his efforts to bring order and centralized authority to the country. Zidan believes that he
can address this problem in part by developing a working majority in the GNC drawing on moderates
and independents, who will support his efforts to establish a modern Islamic regime that can work
with the West, particularly International Oil Companies. That said, he cautions his advisors that he
does not anticipate real success in this regard until the latter part of 2013.

highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1.During mid-October 2012 Libyan President Yussef el Magariaf stated in private that he and
Prime Minister Ali Zidan have ordered National Libyan Army (NLA) Chief of Staff General Youssef al
Mangoush to establish a more coordinated operational relationship with Misrata and Zintan militias
in order to support expanded army operations throughout the country. According to a sensitive
source, prior to the death of the United States Ambassador on September ii, 2012 Mangoush resisted
greater reliance on these specific large militias, believing that such a move undercuts the
government's efforts to disarm and demobilize all of the militias left over from the 2011 civil war. At
this point, however, Mangoush agreed with Magariaf that the situation in the country is becoming
increasingly dangerous and unmanageable. Accordingly, the Chief of Staff stated that he will work
with Ousama al Jouwali, the leader of the Zintan forces to step up operations against the other
militias, (supported by the Misrata troops), that also come from the mountainous region of Western
Libya. At the same time he will instruct NLA troops under ground force commander General Khalifa
Belgasirn Haftar to pursue operations against tribal forces fighting on behalf of the Qaddafi family in
Southern and Southeastern Libya.
2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Magariaf and Zidan agree that Libya's
future depends on the success of their efforts in this militia demobilization operation over the next six
months. While they believe that the involvement of Ansar al Sharia forces, with the assistance of al
Qai'da in the Islamic Magreb (AQIM), in the assassination of the U.S. Ambassador has focused the
world business and diplomatic community on the reality of the security issues surrounding the
militias, the President and Prime Minister also fear that the situation is far worse than Western

sources realize. Mangoush informs them that AQIM and radical Salafist groups are increasing their
efforts to take advantage of the frustrations of the various militias with the government, using the
attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi as an inspiration for their activities. Just as Ansar al Sharia
began as a militia supporting the federalist claims of Eastern tribal leaders, and was then infiltrated
by AQIM radicals, Mangoush believes many of the other regional and ethnic militias around the
country could follow the same path, if his troops do not succeed in the disarmament program. He
also agrees with Zidan that they must move quickly since Libya's tradition of avoiding the Sunni-Shia
conflict that dominates most of Middle East is beginning to erode during this period of chaos.)
3. A particularly sensitive source noted that NLA operations have already begun against Ansar
al Sharia forces south of Benghazi, after members of that militia/terrorist group killed four national
policemen during a grenade attack at a roadblock in the Sousa Mountains. Under orders from Haftar
Libyan troops surrounded more than 100 Ansar al Sharia fighters in the region of the town of Sousa.
According to this sensitive source, the NLA suffered relatively heavy casualties in the fighting, but
believe they captured a number of AQIM operatives and one of Ansar al Sharia's senior commanders,
Sufian bin Qamu, who they believe ordered the attack on the police. Mangoush also reported to Zidan
that Qamu had been previously captured by United States forces and imprisoned at the Guantanamo
Bay facility.
4. At the same time the Libyan army and forces from the Misrata militia entered the town of
Bani Walid approximately 100 miles south of Tripoli, in an area still loyal to the Qaddafi family,
engaging in close fighting with pro-Qaddafi forces. During the fighting Haftar dispatched troops with
heavier arms to support the Misrata forces. According to this source, the NLA downplayed the level of
the fighting, in an effort to reassure the supporters of the Government. That said the NLA/Misrata
force had captured the city center and the airport after suffering significant casualties. The
Government forces entered the city after shelling opposition positions around the city hospital, using
heavy mortars and motorized guns.

I. During mid-October 2012 Libyan President Yussef el Magariaf stated in private that
he and Prime Minister Ali Zidan have ordered National Libyan Army (NLA) Chief of Staff
General Youssef al Mangoush to establish a more coordinated operational relationship with
Misrata and Zintan militias in order to support expanded army operations throughout the country
According to a sensitive source, prior to the death of the United States Ambassador on
September 11, 2012 Mangoush resisted greater reliance on these specific large militias, believing
that such a move undercuts the government's efforts to disarm and demobilize all of the militias
left over from the 2011 civil war. At this point, however, Mangoush agreed with Magariaf that
the situation in the county is becoming increasingly dangerous and unmanageable.
Accordingly, the Chief of Staff stated that he will work with Ousama al Jouwali, the leader of the
Zintan forces to step up operations against the other militias, (supported by the Misrata troops),
that also come from the mountainous region of Western Libya. At the same time he will instruct
NLA troops under ground force commander General Khalifa Belgasim Haftar to pursue
operations against tribal forces fighting on behalf of the Qaddafi family in Southern and
Southeastern Libya.
2. (Source Comment In the opinion of this individual, Magariaf and Ziclan agree that
Libya's future depends on the success of their efforts in this militia demobilization operation
over the next six months. While they believe that the involvement of Ansar al Sharia forces,
with the assistance of al Qai'cla in the Islamic Magrel• (AQIM), in the assassination of the U.S
Ambassador has focused the world business and diplomatic community on the reality of the
security issues surrounding the militias, the President and Prime Minister also fear that the
situation is far worse than Western sources realize Mangoush informs them that AQIM and
radical Salafist groups are increasing their efforts to take advantage of the frustrations of the
various militias with the government, using the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi as an
inspiration for their activities Just as Ansar al Sharia began as a militia supporting the federalist

claims of Eastern tribal leaders, and was then infiltrated by AQIM radicals, Mangoush believes
many of the other regional and ethnic militias around the country could follow the same path, if
his troops do not succeed in the disarmament program. He also agrees with Zidan that they must
move quickly since Libya's tradition of avoiding the Sunni-Shia conflict that dominates most of
Middle East is beginning to erode during this period of chaos.)
3. A particularly sensitive source noted that NLA operations have already begun against
Ansar al Sharia forces south of Benghazi, after members of that militia/terrorist group killed four
national policemen during a grenade attack at a roadblock in the Sousa Mountains. Under orders
from flaftar Libyan troops surrounded more than 100 Ansar al Sharia fighters in the region of the
town of Sousa. According to this sensitive source, the NLA suffered relatively heavy casualties
in the fighting, but believe they captured a number of AQIM operatives and one of Ansar al
Sharia's senior commanders, Sufian bin Qamu, who they believe ordered the attack on the
police. Mangoush also reported to Zidan that Qamu had been previously captured by United
States forces and imprisoned at the Guantanamo Bay facility.
4. At the same time the Libyan army and forces from the Misrata militia entered the
town of Bani Walid approximately 100 miles south of Tripoli, in an area still loyal to the Qaddafi
family, engaging in close fighting with pro-Qaddafi forces. During the fighting Haftar
dispatched troops with heavier arms to support the Misrata forces. According to this source, the
NLA downplayed the level of the fighting, in an effort to reassure the supporters of the
Government. That said the NLAJMisrata force had captured the city center and the airport after
suffering significant casualties. The Government forces entered the city after shelling opposition
positions around the city hospital, using heavy mortars and motorized guns

1.During early December 2012 Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zidan and President Mohamed
Magariaf concluded a series of discreet meetings with selected tribal leaders from Eastern Cyrenaica
region (Barge in Arabic), after which they agreed that the problem of the growing Barge federalist
movement is gaining strength and will again become a major issue in early 2013. At the same time
National Libyan Army (NLA) Chief of Staff General Youssef al Mangoush warned Zidan that the
Eastern tribes have rearmed and reequipped in the past three months and are preparing to reassert
their desire for a degree of autonomy in early 2013. Mangoush also advised that the situation in the
region between Benghazi and the Egyptian border may become increasingly complicated as Salafist
-fighters from Egypt continue to arrive in Benghazi. Mangoush reported that his staff officers have
been advised in secret by aids to Egyptian Army Chief of Staff, General Mohammed al-Sissi, that,
acting under instructions from Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi, military and security forces are
taking steps to detain or neutralize extreme Salafist pare-military groups and that a number of these
fighters are fleeing to Libya. According to the Libyan commander, these Salafist fighters are
comfortable in Benghazi, where many of them served with Libyan revolutionary forces during the
rebellion against former dictatorMuammar al Qaddafi.
2. In the opinion of this individual, Zidan and Magariaf, after consulting with Minister of Oil
Abdulbari al-Arusi, decided to move forward with a plan dating back to the administration of former
Oil Minister Abdulrahman Ben Yezza dividing the National Oil Corporation"s (NOC) production and
exploration divisions into two separate firms. With this in mind, al-Arusi began discussing the matter
with concerned parties in late November and early December. Included in these discussions were
meetings with members of the local federalist council in Benghazi and tribal officials from Barqa. In
these sessions Al-Arusi described a new structure managing all existing oil-related firms, while

building new operations and raising funds from investors outside of the country. This firm will be
divided into two branches, one in Benghazi and one in Tripoli. Al-Arusi added that the cost of this
project will range between fifty (50) and sixty (6o) billion dinars.
3.(Source Comment: According to a separate sensitive source, this concept came as a surprise
to most of the local officials in Tripoli and Benghazi. This individual added that while the Western
officials continue to have some questions about the matter, the Benghazi/Barqa leaders were, in al-
Arusi's opinion, positive, if not enthusiastic about the new initiative. According to al-Arusi, doubts on
either side relate to the mistrust that remains between the two regions, but he is determined to move
ahead in this matter and is supported by Zidan and Magariaf. According to this source, the president
and prime minister are convinced that they must deal with this internal East-West issue before they
can bring a stable security environment to the country, and disarm the remaining independent
militias in each part of the country. This individual added that in private discussions al-Arusi stated
that the tentative name for this new oil entity will be the National Corporation for Oil Refining and
Petrochemicals Industry, with its headquarters in Tripoli, and substantive offices in Benghazi. Like
the NOC, the new firm will fall under the Ministry of Oil and Gas.)
4. In addition, this sensitive source noted that Al-Arusi is also discussing the creation of a
company specializing in mechanical construction related to the oil and gas industry. This firm would
be based in Benghazi. The minister stated in private that he believes such a company can be
developed to compete with international firms in this very complex field. He also believes that such a
firm must be managed by experienced, scientifically-qualified Libyans, with reputations for honesty.
He noted that until as such a cadre is developed it may be desirable to use experts from Egypt to fill
the immediate needs of the firm. Al-Arusi believes this firm should have offices in all of the oil fields
and loading facilities. The minister also plans to establish an office in Benghazi, similar to Tripoli's oil
institute, a facility that will train students looking to pursue oil-related studies. In addition, al-Arusi is
making plans to reopen the Higher Petroleum Institute in Tobruk, which was closed by Qaddafi at the
beginning of the revolution. He told a sensitive source that he expects the Tobruk institute to produce
thousands of skilled engineers to provide Libyan managers for the future operation of the oil sector.
Once the final details are set the Zidan regime will submit the entire package for parliamentary
approval and financing
6. (Source Comment: Advisors to Magariaf state in confidence that, in their opinion this
comprehensive plan for the oil industry will face opposition from individuals with links to foreign oil
firms, primarily foreign trained engineers who hope to see greater privatization in the oil an oil
services industries in the wake of the revolution. According to a particularly sensitive source, Zidan is
particularly concerned about this possibility, noting that these individuals see this issue in strictly
business terms, not considering the political issues, and the East — West situation, that are all part of
the overall picture in Libya. At present al-Arusi believes that foreign oil firms remain concerned
about the unsettled security situation throughout Libya, however; he is convinced that this new plan
will help address this situation. At present, he noted that the large Italian oil firm ENI is stepping up
its operations throughout Libya, and, with the support of the Italian Government, will continue to
increase its investment in Libya in an effort to get ahead of the other foreign firms concerned in
Libya.)

Benghazi's Deep Throat fingers Islamist Leaders for
Attacks as State Dept Criticized on Consular Security
Posted on 12/19/2012 by Juan
The report saying that security was inadequate at the compound that the US had adopted as its ad hoc
consulate in 13enghazio Libya dominates today's headlines. That conclusion is obvious. The
"consulate" was just a private residence taken over for this purpose by the US in the city, It was not
constructed to be a US government building in a potentially hostile city.
I met a person who worked there when I was in Benghazi in June, and she told me that it wasn't even
clear if the consulate would be retained after the first of this year It was possibly temporary,
depending on Congressional funding. (The Tea Party House hasn't been good on meeting requests for
embassy security funds).
The more interesting question than why ad hoc arrangements should have been made for a consulate
during and after the Libyan revolution (the answer to which seems fairly obvious) is, who is
responsible for the string of assassinations and acts of violence in the city, of which the RPG attack on
the consulate on September 11 was only one? Benghazi, with a population of over one million in a
country of 6.5 million, is Libya's second largest city and1/1
e'as the epicenter of the revolution against the
government of Muammar Qaddafi in 2011.
On November 22, Benghazi police chief Farej Darssi was assassinated. In October a police colonel
barely avoided death— his car was wired to explode, A Libyan intelligence officer was killed in
September. A general was assassinated in August. Some of these figures had worked for Qaddafi but
had defected to the revolution. Qaddafi's security forces were responsible for the 1996 massacre of
hardline fundamentalists at Abu Salim prison, and for making others just disappear, Likely the same
shadowy cells that attacked the US consulate are behind the attacks on Benghazi police and army
officers.
There may have been a break in the case. Last Saturday, Benghazi security forces loyal to the elected
government in Tripoli, captured a man they suspected of being involved with the groups behind the
violence. And, he appears to have been willing to spill the beans. So let's call him the Libyan Deep
Throat.
Deep Throat is so knowledgeable about the conspiracies facing the city and so dangerous to those
hatching them that the latter immediately attempted to spring him from jail.
On Sunday morning, militants attacked the police facility next to the holding cell where the man is
being detained. A policeman at that station died in a hail of bullets from the attackers, and they called
for back-up. The police car that sped to the scene as ambushed and three policemen in it were killed.
Still, the police stood their ground and fought off the assault, and they kept their valuable suspect in
custody, with all his valuable testimony.
Shortly after midnight, on Monday morning, small explosives were set off at the Garyounis police
station in Benghazi, damaging a couple of automobiles but otherwise doing little damage. Then
explosives were set off at al-Uruba police station, which also took sniper fire, but neither resulted in
casualties.

The police became vigilant, and they apprehended a shady-looking man skulking around near the al-
Hadaeg police station, finding him to have two rocket propelled grenades in his possession, which he
was apparently intending to fire at the station.
In other words, the capture of Libyan Deep Throat has set off a gang war on the police, who are being
informed by bombings and shootings that they must let their informant go or risk their
So what is Deep Throat saying? According to local journalist Mohamed Bujenah of the Libyan Herald,
a senior figure in the Benghazi police told him that the informant had fingered as many as 7
prominent Muslim fundamentalist leaders in connection with these attacks, of whom the police
named 6 explicitly:
1 Sufyan Ben Qumu, from the notoriously radical town of Derna, and a former prisoner at
Guantanamo
2.Ahmad Bukatela, leader of the ',Thai& Militia
3.Muhammad al-Zahawi, head of the Ansar al-Sharia militia
4.Muhammad al-Gharabi, a leader of the Rafallala al-Sahati Militia
5.Ismail Sallabi, another leader of Rafallah al-Sahati
6.Salim .Nabous, head of the Zawiya Martyrs' Brigade
It is just a newspaper article. We don't know if the informant actually named these individuals or if he
did so to escape torture, in which case we can't trust what he said. But if the allegations are true, there
is collusion among several hardline militias in the city to create instability in hopes of taking it over.
The new, elected, prime minister Ali Zeidan, has started asserting himself militarily. He closed the
country's southern borders against instability in the Sahel. He may well have some risky house
cleaning to do in Benghazi.

Re: New president of Libya
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council,as well as the highest levels
of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
I. During early August, 2012, Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel
Jalil held discreet meetings with Mohammed Yussef Magariaf, the then leader of the newly elected General
National Congress (GNC), who Jalil learned was to be named interim President of Libya when the NTC stepped
down. During these sessions the two leaders worked out the transition to a new, elected interim Government for
Libya; focusing on the need to restore stability and security by disarming the militia units which fought in the
2011 revolution against former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. According to a source with excellent access to
both parties, Jalil came away from the meeting convinced that Magariaf is intent on becoming Libya's first
elected president following the overthrow of Qaddafi. Jalil was pleased to learn that Magariaf strongly supports
the three-party Cairo Declaration negotiated between the NTC and the Governments of Tunisia and Egypt in
late July allowing for increased trade and a relaxation of existing travel restrictions.
2. According to this individual, Jalil and Magariaf agree that Tunisia and Egypt hold the key to Libya's
future economic success, with Libya providing the funding for new projects, while Egypt and Tunisia provide
technical expertise. Magariaf stated privately that this relationship marks a departure from the Qaddafi years
when Libya's natural resources fell under the control of foreign firms and governments. Jalil added that
Magariaf will welcome investment and cooperation from American and Western European banks and
corporations, but believes Libya, supported by the new governments rising out of the Arab Spring, must
maintain control over all aspects of the industries involved in exploiting its natural resources. In this regard,
with the support of both Jalil and Magariaf, the Libyan Ministry of Finance is increasing the level of Libyan
investment in the Cairo stock exchange. In turn, Magariaf and Egyptian President Mohamad Morsi discussed
increased Tunisian and Egyptian investment in the Benghazi stock exchange as the economic situation in Libya
becomes more orderly.

3. In commenting on the new Interim President, Jalil added that Magariaf s current position is bolstered
by the fact that he is not tied to any particular faction. At the same time he has maintained the respect that is
attached to his role as the first Libyan leader to direct an armed revolt against Qaddafi. This fighting was
carried out by the rebel Libyan National Army in 1981. Magariaf is an academic and diplomat with well
established Islamist credentials and good relationships with business and government leaders in the United
States and Western Europe. A separate sensitive source noted that one interesting issue to watch is Magariaf s
relationship with General Khalifa Belqasim Haftar, the commander of one sections of the new Libyan Army.
Haftar has been at odds with many of the militia commanders and is currently leading Libyan forces in the
Kufra region, attempting to end local tribal fighting and block the smuggling of arms and supplies to pro-
Qaddafi militias by supporters based in South Sudan. In the years between 1981 and 1990 Haftar (then Colonel
Haftar) commanded the rebel Libyan National Army, under Magariaf s National Front for the Salvation of
Libya (NFSL). One source notes that Magariaf s opposition to Qaddafi was based on the dictator's betrayal of
Islamic principles, a position that, at that time, was supported by the Western Allies.
4. According to this individual, Jalil also spoke with former Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril, who
indicated that he and Magariaf agree on many issues, including the belief that they can build an Islamic state in
Libya that can function in the world economy and the international diplomatic community. He did note that he
believes Magariaf s view of the role of Islam in the day to day function of the government is more conservative
than his, but these are differences that can be sorted out in the GNC. In the opinion of this individual Jabril is
well aware of the fact that, while his National Force Alliance (NFA) controls a solid bloc of thirty nine (39)
seats in the GNC and Magariaf's National Front Party (NFP) holds no seats in its own right, the interim
President has established good working relationships with at least 100 of the 120 independent members of the
GNC. Magariaf received 113 votes in his election as Interim President. Again these independent deputies
respect Magariaf s role in fighting the Qaddafi regime.
5.(Source Comment: This particularly sensitive individual stated in strict confidence that Magariaf sees
his role as establishing an efficient interim government, while overseeing the drafting of a new constitution and
election law. This individual believes that Magariaf is very interested in winning the presidency under this new
law. Besides meeting with Jalil and Jibril, Magariaf is talking to liberal politicians including former Oil and
Finance Minister Ali Tarhouni, and the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood's (MB) Justice and Construction
Party (JCP), including Mohamad Sowan.)
6. This individual adds that Jalil believes Magariaf will face a very difficult period as he addresses the
many issues left unresolved by the NTC and the interim regime of Prime Minister .kbdel Rahman el-Keib. Jalil
has been highly frustrated by el-Keib's inability to disarm the many militia units left over from the 2011
revolution against Qaddafi. At the same time he has advised Magariaf to move quickly in replacing el-Keib's
cabinet while deciding which ministers to retain. The new interim government is facing a problem of
lawlessness and attacks against foreigners, including representatives of the Egyptian Government; this at a time
when the new Muslim Brotherhood government of Egypt is reaching out to increase business and diplomatic
contacts between the two countries. According to a sensitive source, Libyan military intelligence officers
believe these attacks are the work of Qaddafi loyalists, while former NTC officials fear that they may be carried
out by dissident Islamist groups, frustrated with the results of the national elections, which many of them
boycotted.
7. (Source Comment: An extremely sensitive source stated in confidence that Libyan Military
Intelligence officers reported to Jalil and later Magariaf that a series of bombings in Tripoli and Benghazi
appear to be the work of Qaddafi loyalists looking to create tension between the Libyan and Egyptian
Governments. These attacks included the car of an Egyptian diplomat, which was blown up near his home in
Benghazi, a day after several deadly bomb attacks in the capital Tripoli. At the same time, a homemade bomb
exploded under the vehicle of the Egyptian consulate's first secretary Abdelhamid Rifai in one of the Tripoli's
most affluent neighborhoods. No one was hurt during this attack. Earlier in August, three car bombs exploded
near the Ministry of Interior in Tripoli, killing two people and wounding three others. This sensitive source

added that security officers arrested 32 members of what they describe as an organized network of Gaddafi
loyalists linked to the attacks. During this period, the Red Cross suspended its activities in Benghazi and
Misrata after one of its compounds in Misrata was attacked with grenades and rockets. In late July seven
Iranian relief workers associated with the Libyan Red Crescent were kidnapped by tribal troops still loyal to the
Qaddafi family. Security officials have no word on the whereabouts of these relief workers.)
8. According to this source, while the Cairo Declaration received a positive reception among Libyan
political and business leaders, it also created a drastic increase in the number of Libyan's applying for Egyptian
visas under the new, simplified process. This workload has created a backlog of applications, and in mid-
August, a group of Libyan nationals frustrated with the Egyptian visa process attacked the interior of the
Egyptian consulate in Tripoli. These Libyan applicants were angry about the time it was taking to receive visas
to enter Egypt and were demanding that the staff work past their stated hours of operation. A sensitive source
noted that a number of Libyans destroyed the furniture in the main waiting room and attacked the consulate.
The Magariaf Government has assured the Egyptian ambassador that additional security personnel will be
assigned to guard the Embassy, at least until the visa backlog is reduced.

Re: New president of Libya
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as
the highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. During early August, 2012, Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) President
Mustafa Abdel Jalil held discreet meetings with Mohammed Yussef Magariaf, the then leader of
the newly elected General National Congress (GNC), who Jalil learned was to be named interim
President of Libya when the NTC stepped down. During these sessions the two leaders worked
out the transition to a new, elected interim Government for Libya; focusing on the need to restore
stability and security by disarming the militia units which fought in the 2011 revolution against
former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. According to a source with excellent access to both
parties, Jalil came away from the meeting convinced that Magariaf is intent on becoming Libya's
first elected president following the overthrow of Qaddafi. Jalil was pleased to learn that
Magariaf strongly supports the three-party Cairo Declaration negotiated between the NTC and
the Governments of Tunisia and Egypt in late July allowing for increased trade and a relaxation
of existing travel restrictions.
2. According to this individual, Jalil and Magariaf agree that Tunisia and Egypt hold the
key to Libya's future economic success, with Libya providing the funding for new projects,
while Egypt and Tunisia provide technical expertise. Magariaf stated privately that this
relationship marks a departure from the Qaddafi years when Libya's natural resources fell under
the control of foreign firms and governments. Jalil added that Magariaf will welcome
investment and cooperation from American and Western European banks and corporations, but
believes Libya, supported by the new governments rising out of the Arab Spring, must maintain
control over all aspects of the industries involved in exploiting its natural resources. In this
regard, with the support of both Jalil and Magariaf, the Libyan Ministry of Finance is increasing
the level of Libyan investment in the Cairo stock exchange. In turn, Magariaf and Egyptian
President Mohamad Morsi discussed increased Tunisian and Egyptian investment in the
Benghazi stock exchange as the economic situation in Libya becomes more orderly.

Re: New President of Libya
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1.(Source Comment: As the new interim President of Libya Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf is
determined to establish a democratic state based on Islamic principles. In the opinion of an
extremely sensitive source, Magariaf sees this moment as the climax his entire life's work. Having
first served deposed dictator Muammar al Qaddafi as a policy advisor and diplomat, in 1979 Magariaf
became disenchanted with what he saw as the cult of personality that Qaddafi was building for
himself while turning against the basic beliefs of the Islamist movement. Magariaf was member of the
Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood in his student days and remains a devout Islamist intellectual, albeit
one who believes that Islam can coexist and even work with the non-Muslim world, particularly the
United States and Western Europe. This source also believes that Magariaf is convinced that Libya,
with its great natural wealth, can become a leading player in North Africa, as well as the rest of the
Islamic world. Magariaf is particularly well disposed toward the governments of the United States
and France, based on past experiences with each during his struggle with Qaddafi. This source also
believes that he remains hostile to the government of Omar al Bashir in Sudan. In 1989 Bashir
overthrew Magariafs ally, then Sudanese Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi and expelled Magariaf and
his followers from Khartoum.)
2. According to the same sensitive source, Magariaf will also seek a discreet relationship with
Israel. Political realities in Libya at present will dictate that this relationship be handled in a low key
manner, but the new President of Libya shares many common friends and associates with the leaders
of Israel and intends to take advantage of this situation to improve the lot of the Libyan people.
Magariaf may, at times, be forced to make statements critical of Israel for his own political purposes,
but believes he and his associates have the experience and sophistication to manage this issue. At the

same time Magariaf intends to pursue aggressively the regional political initiatives begun by National
Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jalil. Magariaf will pursue the economic and
security cooperation set out in the Cairo Declaration of July 29, 2012 establishing a regional bond
between the new revolutionary governments of Tunisia, Libya and Egypt. This same individual notes
that Magariaf is aware of the fact that Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi sees Libya as a key factor
in Egypt's economic development; and the Libyan leader believes he can manipulate this situation to
the advantage of the Libyan people.
3. A separate sensitive source stated on condition of strict secrecy that Magariaf intends to
work with his security advisors to develop a plan for disarming the Islamist militias who fought
against Qaddafi, without arousing their suspicion. He believes that the most important step in this
matter will be providing the medical and economic services demanded by these militias in return for
disarming. Magariaf also believes that he can manage the political ambitions of Islamist leaders like
General Abdelhakim Belhaj, while preventing the growth of radical groups who might see Libya as a
base of operations and support. Magariaf and his supporters believe that his Islamist/anti-Qaddafi
credentials will allow him to manage these challenges, and if he can do so he will be able to win the
presidency outright in the first full scale national presidential election in the spring of 2013.
4. This source adds that, while avoiding direct involvement in the Syrian crisis, the Magariaf
government will support Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the rest of the nations calling for the end of
the regime of Basher al Assad. Magariaf harbors a particular sense of hostility toward Assad, who was
a longtime ally of Qaddafi, supporting him with equipment, intelligence, and advisors throughout the
revolution of 2011. Magariaf realizes that this stance will also bring him into conflict with Syria's ally
Iran, but does not believe Iran has a role to play in Libya, or the rest of North Africa.
5. According to an extremely sensitive source, in 1979 Magariaf, having become increasingly
disenchanted with Qaddafi, fled Libya for Khartoum in Sudan, where in 1981, with the help of the
government of Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi, Chadian leader Hissene Habre, Iraqi President
Sadaam Hussein, and several Western states, he established The National Front for the Salvation of
Libya (NFSL), dedicated to overthrowing Qaddafi and establishing an Islamic democracy in Libya.
Under the auspices of the NFSL, Magariaf also organized the Libyan National Army (LNA), based in
Ndjamena, Chad. The LNA was commanded by the Colonel Khalifa Belqasim Haftar, who is now one
of the commanding generals of the new Libyan Army. Under Magariaf s authority the Haftar force,
which numbered between 2,500 and 3,000 troops, fought several battles with Qaddafi's troops, with
mixed results. These attacks included a raid on Qaddafi's compound at Bab al-Aziza in 1986. The
LNA also maintained a 50,000 watt radio station in Ndjamena, broadcasting anti-Qaddafi material
into Libya. This radio station was supported by Western governments and Iraqi Military Intelligence.
6. The LNA's greatest success came in support of the Chadian Army under General Idriss
Deby, in their overwhelming victory over Libyan troops at the battle Ouadi Doum in 1987. This
victory forced the Libyan Army and Air Force out of Chad, and was supported by the French Air Force
and other Western personnel. Following the battle Deby became a national hero in Chad. In 1990,
with the support of Libyan intelligence officers, Deby, who had undergone military training in Libya
and France, rebelled against and overthrew the Habre Government. At that time Deby, under
Qaddafi's influence, forced the LNA to abandon Chad for Zaire, and eventually the United States.
Magariaf and Haftar both settled in the United States, and while the LNA no longer existed as an
effective force, Magariaf continued to maintain the NFSL as a political organization. In 2004
Magariaf and the NFSL joined the National Conference for the Libyan Opposition (NCLO), eventually
returning to support the 2011 revolution.
7. (Source Comment: In the opinion of an extremely sensitive source speaking on condition of
strict secrecy, Magariaf views himself as an Islamist politician who can work with both Islamic and

also sees the current situation as vindication for all of the problematic experiences he encountered in

reputation for integrity, commitment to Islam, and his ability to work with divergent groups to
establish himself as an effective interim President, and eventually the first elected Libyan Head of
State in mid-2013. Ma gariaf plans to draw on all political, religious, and ethnic groups to form his
cabinet, using his stature to form a representative government under the General National Council.)

well as the highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and
security services.
1. During the afternoon of September 11, 2012 new interim President of Libya
Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf spoke in private with senior advisors, including the
members of the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood, to discuss the attacks by demonstrators
on U.S. missions in Tripoli and Benghazi. According to a sensitive source, el Magariaf
was shaken by the attacks, and gave permission to commanders on the ground for
security forces to open fire over the heads of the crowds in an effort to break up mobs
attacking the missions. During this session, a senior security officer told el Magariaf
that the attacks on that day were inspired by what many devout Libyan viewed as a
sacrilegious internet video on the prophet Mohammed originating in America. The
Libyan attacks were also inspired by and linked to an attack on the U.S. mission in
Egypt on the same day. At the same time, el Magariaf noted in strong terms that the
atmosphere that made fostered these incidents in Libya is the product of widespread
publicity regarding the security situation in the country between 2004 and 2010 and

the cooperation that developed between a number of Western Intelligence services and
the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi.
2. This source added that el Magariafs advisors believe that this situation adds
to the President's growing concern over the unpredictable effects that will follow
current covert efforts by his political opponents to link him directly to foreign
intelligence services. According to a separate sensitive source, el Magariaf noted that
his opponents had often tried to connect him to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) through the National Front for the Salvation of Libya (NFSL), a group
established in opposition to former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi, which el Magariaf
led in the 198os. In the opinion of this individual el Magariaf believes that he can
survive potential negative publicity in this regard, but if this situation continues to
develop in this manner it will complicate his efforts to establish an orderly
administration in the country. Again, he stated that the attacks on the U.S. missions
were as much a result of the atmosphere created by this campaign, as the controversial
internet video.
3. At the same time, this .individual noted that several of el Magariaf s advisors
share his concerns in this matter, pointing out that the return of Qaddafi's intelligence
chief Abdullah al-Senoussi for trial in Libya has heightened public interest in the
liaison relationships conducted by the CIA and British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS)
with Qaddfis intelligence and security services. These same individuals note that they
believe Islamist militia forces under the command of General Abdeihaldm Belhaj
captured files and documents describing this relationship from Qaddafi's offices in
Tripoli. This fascination with Western intelligence operations in Qaddafi's Libya is also
driven by Human Rights Watch (HRW) and its efforts to tie Western governments to
human rights violations committed under Qaddafi. In this regard HRW has
interviewed at least fourteen (14) individuals claiming that they were.turned over to
Qaddafi's forces by the Western powers. Belhaj is included in this group.
4. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el Magariaf s
enemies are .working to take advantage of his suspected links to the CIA at a time when
Western intelligence services are under scrutiny in Libya. They also fear that this
situation will only grow more complex as Qaddafi's son Saif al Islam Qaddafi and al
Senousi are brought before Libyan courts to answer for their crimes under the old
regime, particularly during the 2011 revolution. These individuals believe both men
will be linked to Western Intelligence during their trials. )
5. According to this individual, el Magariaf is working with the Muslim
Brotherhood and other Islamist groups to defuse this situation. He is particularly
concerned by the level of violence between Sufi Muslims and Salafists, and believes he
must maintain his reputation for impartiality if he is to defuse this growing problem.
As he works to organize the government, and disarm the militias, he cannot afford to
lose the respect and trust of the Libyan people, especially at a time when cultural

conflicts were largely unknown during Qaddafi's rule.
6. (Source Comment: This source added that the individuals interviewed for the
HRW report were former members of the Libyan Islamist Fighting Group (LIFG), an
Islamist group formed in opposition to Gaddafi's controversial interpretations of Islam.
These LIFG fighters fled the country in the late 1980s and went to Afghanistan to join
the fight against the Soviet Union while also gaining training and experience for their
own struggle. A separate source adds that messages to Libya from the CIA and SIS
were found among the Tripoli Documents published by HRW, indicating that the
United States and Britain were eager to help Libya capture several senior LIFG figures,
including its co-founders, Belhaj and Sarni al-Saadi.)

surrender weapons following last year's civil war, Salafis, who say Islam should return
to the simple ways followed by Mohammed, have established their own armed gangs in
post-Gaddafi Libya. They view Sufi practices as idolatrous. Since the start of the Arab
Spring uprising across the region, a number of Sufi sites have been attacked in Egypt,
Mali and Libya. Magariaf is determined to establish a democratic state based on
Islamic principles. This individual adds that Magariaf remains dedicated to the idea of
building a tolerant Islamic state in Libya. El Magariafs opinions continue to be shaped
by his experience with Qaddafi, whom he felt built a cult of personality in violation of
all of the basic ideas of Islam.

Re: Agenda with Merkel
The Transatlantic Economic Council was Chancellor Angela Merkel's major initiative when
Germany held the EU presidency in 2007. She got President George W. Bush to agree to its
formation. But the council now languishes. Has the US appointed its representative? The council
is more about coordinating regulatory matters than trade, by the way. Raising Merkel's project
and reinvigorating it would undoubtedly be well received. Below is an article from Europolitics
Daily from January 2009 on the council. State could work this up.

By Brian Beary in Washington I Friday 16 January 2009
As Barack Obama was coasting to victory, last November, the leader of the Socialist MEPs, Martin
Schulz, urged him to "make sure Europe is on the top of his in-tray". Two months on, there is
considerable doubt as to whether Obama will indeed take this advice or leave Europe lingering
towards the bottom of the pile. Nowhere is this danger more striking than with the Transatlantic
Economic Council (TEC), the body German Chancellor Angela Merkel persuaded President George Bush
to set up in April 2007 to remove regulatory barriers to transatlantic trade.
STILL NO TEC CHAIR
Obama has been widely praised for moving quickly, by comparison to previous new presidents, to

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760157 Date: 06/30/2015
nominate his new administration. Yet his spokesman told Europolitics he has still not appointed the
future co-chair of the TEC. In the interim, Michelle O'Neill, Deputy Undersecretary at the Department
of Commerce, has been tasked with ensuring continuity. The EU Co-Chair is Commission Vice-
President Gunter Verheugen. Given that dozens of nominations have already been announced, this
may be a sign that among his long list of priorities, the TEC, the most significant EU-US initiative to
emerge in recent years, will not feature highly. It should be noted that when Obama was chair of the
Senate Subcommittee on Europe, from 2007 to 2008, he did not organise a single hearing, something
on which his then rival in the presidential campaign, Senator Hillary Clinton, tried - and failed - to
score political points.
The Democrats, who have grown more protectionist-minded on trade, now have a commanding
majority in both the US Senate and House of Representatives. Obama, himself a Democrat, is being
careful to cultivate good relations with them and not take for granted their support, which he
desperately needs to push through his ambitious economic policy agenda. It was Congress that in 2007
introduced the 100% rule, requiring all US-bound containers leaving European ports to be scanned
before being loaded onto the departing ship. This has been a thorn in the EU's side ever since and now
features on the TEC agenda. In the current climate, Congress is unlikely to be clamouring to scrap the
rule and may not even wish to extend the 2012 implementation deadline as the EU is asking. Anxious
not to burn bridges, Obama could well go along with Congress in order to avoid an unnecessary fight.
AMERICANS NOT SO HOT ON TRADE
Congress' protectionism does not magically appear in a vacuum. It is reflective of mounting fears
among the US public about the impact free trade has on US jobs. Their fears are not entirely
groundless. American manufacturing jobs are indeed going overseas - notably to India and China. And
being unemployed in the US is a more perilous predicament than in Europe because government
unemployment benefits are less generous and more temporary. Moreover, most Americans, unlike
Europeans, have their health care paid for by their employer so if they lose their job they also lose
their health care. Hardly surprising, therefore, that only 59% of Americans think trade is good for their
country, compared to 78% of French and British, 80% of Czechs and 85% of Germans, a Pew Research
Centre survey has shown.
This bearish sentiment has a knock-on effect on all trade dossiers. For example, it makes Congress less
amenable to scrapping the law requiring US airlines to be in 'actual control' of US citizens - something
the EU is urging in the current Open Sky II aviation liberalisation talks. It makes US lawmakers more
likely to take action to prevent European companies winning lucrative US defence contracts. This is
happening already with the epic tussle between Boeing and Airbus over the Pentagon's US$35 billion
refuelling tanker contract (see separate article). EU officials are clinging to the hope that Obama, as
president, will adopt a more global outlook and drag the Democratic Congress along with him rather
than the other way around.
A VICTIM OF DULLNESS?
The TEC, despite having failed to deliver as much as many hoped for, remains an extremely useful
tool. By emphasising regulatory rather than tariff barriers, it shows an understanding of where the
real problems lie in today's trading environment. The EU and the US could use the TEC to create a
global standard in hugely important sectors, such as toys and food. "The alternative," as Dan Hamilton,
director of the Centre for Transatlantic Relations at Johns Hopkins University in Washington notes, "is
that we end up with Chinese standards".
Yet the TEC has one weakness no one should underestimate: its dullness. Discussing highly technical
regulatory divergences, such as whether to wash chickens in chlorine or water, may have been
Chancellor Merkel's cup of tea but French President Nicolas Sarkozy showed little interest in it during
the French EU Presidency. Without strong impetus from someone on Obama's team who has the power

to make things happen, the TEC - like an old soldier - might not actually die but just fade away.
EU-US economy
While there is much talk about the rising power of China and India, the transatlantic economy
still far outstrips the rest of the world in size and wealth. The EU27 and the US accounted for
nearly 57% of world gross domestic product in 2007, while the transatlantic economy made up
47% of world exports and 52% of world imports. The net worth per household in the US is
US$565,000, in France US$518,000, in the U.K. US$599,000, compared to just US$18,000 in
China, US$31,000 in Russia and US$44,000 Brazil.

Re: Berlin speeches
Below are my notes for speeches in Berlin. The themes I stress are these: the importance of
Berlin and the Brandenburg Gate as symbols of freedom; the weight of history (always felt by
Germans); the contribution of the US and the salience of the Western alliance; the meaning of
1989 to today and especially the continuity of the Western alliance; and segue from past to
future.
What I have not done here but might be added are references to Angela Merkel (a courageous
woman from the east who embodies the highest values of the West); and specific policies. Those
can be fitted in.
So, some ideas and language:
Twenty years ago the wall fell. Here, in Berlin, the moment when tens of thousands of citizens
tore it down with hammers and picks and bare hands is called "Die Wende," a phrase that means
more than simply a change but a turning point in history. It was not only a turning point for
Germany and Europe but also for the United States because the wall—the reason for its
construction and the reason for its destruction—is central to our common history—and to our
common future.
Richard von Weizsaecker said, "As long as the Brandenburg Gate is closed, the German question
will remain open." Today I can say with finality, the German question is closed, because the
Brandenburg Gate is wide open! The gate is open, Europe is open, and our future together is
open.
In the forty years from the Berlin airlift to the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Atlantic partnership
proved itself the most successful alliance for freedom in history. That alliance was, is and shall
be the crowning achievement of American foreign policy. And the German – American
relationship has always served as its foundation. Our alliance represents the reconciliation of

former enemies, an inspiration to other peoples and continents devastated by war and hatred,
and it must never be taken for granted.
In the twenty years since the fall of the wall we have created architecture for an enduring peace.
Instead of a wall we have built a gateway to the future. President Kennedy said in 1963 that in
the future free men everywhere will say, "Ich bin emn Berliner." Today Berlin has gained a new
and even more powerful meaning. Forever into the future, the opening of this Gate will be the
symbol of the return of the dream of freedom, not only to Berlin and Germany, but to the entire
world.
The Gate, we must remember, was not built as a symbol of freedom. And each of the tyrannies
that used the Gate as a symbol believed it represented their eternal power. The Gate was first
erected as a symbol against the French Revolution; then it became a symbol of the imperial
ambitions of Napoleon who marched his army through. It was a symbol of Prussian militarism
and monarchy. It was seized by the Nazi Party as the symbol of its 1000 year rule. And then it
became a symbol of the Communist totalitarianism that built a wall to separate the people of
Berlin as though freedom could be contained in only one part of the city. Here, in Berlin, the
Cold War was coldest.
We celebrate the fact that the wall that marred this proud city was taken down by the world's
most enthusiastic wrecking crew. The United States always believed in the freedom of Berlin
because we believed in the future of freedom. The courageous citizens of East Germany, Poland
and other nations of the Communist bloc demonstrated their dedication to free and peaceful
solution of conflicts through their stand against dictatorship. America stood resolutely as an ally
at every moment of this struggle and moved swiftly to help the peoples of Europe reunite after
1989.
We celebrate the steadiness of purpose, the restraint and respect for ultimate goals that allowed
the Cold War to end in peace. For how the victory was won was essential to the triumph. 1989
was special. It was that rarest of historical events: a revolution that did not descend into
violence. As a result the Gate survives not as a cautionary monument to history's darkest.
moments but to its brightest. Today we celebrate the revolution of 1989, the turning point that
transformed the Brandenburg Gate into the symbol of the hope of democracy and the promise of
freedom.
Berliner Luft, the air of Berlin, has always been unique. I can feel and smell the spirit of freedom
in your streets. The great American poet Carl Sandburg called Berlin the Chicago of Europe.
Chicago is where I was born and raised. I can sense the same energy, openness and dedication to
hard work in both great cities. Another Chicagoan, President Barack Obama, was drawn to
Berlin last July, a city that he said made him feel like a citizen of the world and a citizen of the
future.
I was very proud to visit our new Embassy at the Brandenburg Gate, located exactly where the
Wall used to run. Our presence here will forever underscore our determination that the spark of
freedom from this city in 1989 will help light the torches of freedom throughout the world.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760180 Date: 06/30/2015
The revolution of 1989 did not mark the end of history. Having made history together, we are
summoned to secure freedom for future generations. As vital at the beginning of the 21' century
as it was in the last half of the 20th, the Western alliance is called to new tasks. The dreams of
1989 reached far—and have farther to reach. Old hatreds and conflicts—in the Balkins, the
Caucauses, in the Middle East, East Asia, and Africa—still simmer. We have much to
demonstrate what we have learned from the last century. Without freedom, without the rule of
law, without the opportunity for people to support themselves and their families — without basic
human rights-- anger, aggression and violence will prevail.
Today we are faced with difficult and often dangerous conflicts arising not from conflicts
between nations but within them, conflicts exploited by zealots who make the false claim that
violence will purify the world and open the gates of heaven. Once zealots tried to use this Gate to
symbolize that message. But through the courage and determination of the people of Berlin and
their stalwart allies, this Gate now stands for a true revolution of the spirit. The long twilight
struggle to tear down this wall to make Europe whole and free inspires us, in this new century, to
help other peoples gain the same measure of security, respect and progress.
We need Berlin more than ever today. We need your courage, your fortitude, your commitment
to the rights of men—and women—we need your example. We are hardly at the end of the
history of the West. Standing here, where a wall once stood but is no more, in the light from the
Gate, we have learned from history's deepest lessons. Our alliance, linked by shared struggle,
dedicated to the ideals of freedom and democracy, strong from the world we have built, now
faces a new world of challenges. And we are ready to meet and conquer them. We know it has
been done before. We are free men—and women—and proud to say, We are all Berliners.

Re: The Berlusconi assault
1. The physical attack on Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is a major political event
in Italy and Europe. His assailant is a mentally disturbed man without a political agenda
who has been in and out of psychiatric care since he was 18 years old. Nonetheless, the
assault has significant repercussions. It has generated sympathy for Berlusconi as a
victim—he has been obviously injured, lost two teeth and a pint of blood, and doctors
will keep him in the hospital for perhaps a week for observation. The attack comes as
Berlusconi was beginning to lose political footing, having lost his legal immunity. One
court inquiry is turning up evidence of his links to the Mafia while another is examining
his role in the bribery case of British lawyer David Mills. Berlusconi' s government and
party have used the attack as a way to turn the sudden sympathy for him to his advantage,
claiming that his opponents have sown a climate of "hate." Through demogogic appeals
they are attempting to discredit and rebuff the legal proceedings against him and
undermine the investigative press. (Berlusconi is suing La Repubblica, the large
independent newspaper in Rome that has been most aggressive in digging into his affairs
of all kinds.)
2. It would seem proper and decent for the President to call Berlusconi to express his
concern about his health and wish him a speedy recovery, if he hasn't done so already.
There are many reasons for Obama to do this, not least to condemn violence against a
democratically elected head of state. It would be awkward for the U.S. President not to
call a Western head of state of a NATO country who has been physically harmed.
Berlusconi, for his part, would certainly make such a call public. It would therefore also
be awkward if a call were used only as an element in his sympathy campaign against the
court proceedings.
3. If so, there is a larger message that should be communicated, perhaps by the President in
his conversation, but most importantly through a statement from the State Department,
also conveyed by the U.S. ambassador in Italy. The USG condemns any and all violence

as an assault on democracy. By the same measure, this incident involving an apparently
deranged individual should not be exploited to raise social tensions. Instead, it should
inspire reflection on the necessity of every citizen to adhere to the rule of law as well as
to respect freedom of speech and the press.

Berlusconi 'cut deal with Mafia', court told
Former hitman claims Italian PM gave 'benefits' to the Mob for political support
By Michael Day in Milan
Saturday, 5 December 2009
The Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, made a deal with the Sicilian Mafia in the early
1990s that put the country "in the hands" of the Mob, a court in Turin was told yesterday.
Gaspare Spatuzza, a jailed Mafia hitman turned witness, told a packed and heavily guarded
bunker courtroom that his Cosa Nostra Godfather boss had cut a deal with Mr Berlusconi in 1993
that provided unspecified "benefits" to the Mafia in exchange for political support. The media
tycoon entered politics a few months later and won his first term as Prime Minister in 1994.
Spatuzza said his boss, Giuseppe Graviano, who was jailed over Mafia bomb attacks in Rome,
Milan and Florence, had told him that the Mob had "got everything" with the help of Mr
Berlusconi, adding that Graviano called Mr Berlusconi "the man from Channel 5", in reference
to his TV network.
The damaging claims came at the appeal hearing of Marcello Dell'Utri, a key Berlusconi
associate and senator, who is challenging his nine-year jail sentence for links with the Mafia.
Spatuzza, in prison for several murders, testified: "Graviano told me the name of Berlusconi and
said that thanks to him and the man from our home town [an apparent reference to Dell' Utri] we
have the country in our hands."
Mr Berlusconi has denounced the claims of Spatuzza as "vile", and "unfounded and defamatory",
denying ever having links with the Mafia. The Prime Minister's spokesman said the testimony
yesterday was the Mafia's "completely logical" revenge against the Prime Minister for his
"determined" fight against organised crime.

Dell'Utri told the court that neither he nor Mr Berlusconi had Mafia connections. "It's in the
interest of the Mafia to force the collapse of the Berlusconi government because this government
has done the most in the fight against organised crime," he said. Mr Berlusconi, who recently lost
his legal immunity to prosecution, was said to have been furious this week, after the
parliamentary Speaker, Gianfranco Fini, the man who is supposed to be his closest ally, had said
that the Spatuzza evidence was "an atomic bomb".
Mr Fini was recorded by an unobserved microphone while talking privately at an official dinner.
Rumours of the conservative Prime Minister's links with the Mob have persisted since
investigators learnt that a Cosa Nostra hitman, Vittorio Mangano, worked as Mr Berlusconi's
"stable-master" at the media mogul's villa in Arcore outside Milan in the 1970s. Much
speculation has also centred on the origins of Mr Berlusconi's vast wealth.
Last week, the Prime Minister's broadcast group, Mediaset, and his holding company, Fininvest,
announced it intended to sue the left-wing newspaper La Repubblica over an article that said
Mediaset was "20 per cent owned by the Mafia".
La Stampa newspaper noted that the "dread combination of Mafia allegations and separation
from his wife are now his principal torments". Mr Berlusconi's estranged wife, Veronica Lario, is
said to be seeking a £3m-a-month divorce settlement, and a messy courtroom battle looms. Mr
Berlusconi also faces a retrial on the charge that he bribed the British lawyer David Mills to lie in
court.

After a Court Ruling, Berlusconi's Legal
Woes Resume
By Jeff Israely
The world has spent the past six months wondering how — and with whom — Silvio Berlusconi
spends his Saturday nights. But the combative, scandal-plagued Prime Minister of Italy would
prefer to talk about his mornings instead. "Do you know how I've been forced to spend my
Saturday mornings since I entered politics?" Berlusconi once declared to business leaders in
Rome. "With my lawyers."
Italy's self-proclaimed Defendant in Chief makes a point of lamenting all those weekends spoiled
by stacks of court dossiers as further proof that he is the victim of politically motivated
magistrates, whom he called during the same speech "the spreading cancer of our democracy."
(See Berlusconi's worst gaffes.)

To combat such perceived persecution, Berlusconi has tested the bounds of decorous democratic
conduct, including his allies' pushing a bill through Parliament last year that gave him and other
top Italian officeholders immunity from prosecution. But since the Constitutional Court
overturned that law in October, several criminal investigations into Berlusconi's business
dealings have been reopened, with other new charges rumored to be looming.
The potentially most damaging trial is set to resume Friday, Dec. 4, in Milan, with the 73-year-
old billionaire being accused of paying British attorney David Mills $600,000 in 1997 to
withhold incriminating evidence about his broadcasting empire Mediaset. Mills is appealing a
conviction in the same case; both men have denied any wrongdoing.
So, alas, Berlusconi is back to spending his downtime with a well-paid cadre of more than a
dozen avvocati, who have been successful so far in keeping their biggest client clear of criminal
convictions. Not that the lawyers have ever really gone away. Since the media baron first ran for
office 15 years ago, his legal advisers have doubled as political consiglieri, key members of
Parliament and even important Cabinet Ministers. Indeed, while some critics have spoken of
Berlusconi's reign as a kind of sultanate of showgirls or government by gaffe, others have
described it as a republic of attorneys. (See what Berlusconi's Obama "jokes" say about Italy.)
His longtime lawyer Cesare Previti served as Italian Defense Minister during Berlusconi's first
term in 1994 before being convicted of corruption himself (and losing twice on appeal). During
Berlusconi's second term (2001-06), Gaetano Pecorella, a former leftist, served as president of
Parliament's Justice Commission, where he was instrumental in shepherding through new laws
that helped shield Berlusconi from investigating magistrates.
Giovanni Sartori, a Columbia University professor of constitutional law, says the role
Berlusconi's personal lawyers have played in his legislative agenda is yet another gargantuan
conflict of interest to add to those related to his ownership of Italy's main private television
stations. But by now, Sartori says, Berlusconi's lawyers have perfected the art of exploiting
Italy's painfully slow justice system: many cases conclude without a final verdict because the
statute of limitations has been reached. "It is more a mania than a necessity," Sartori says of
Berlusconi's near obsession in battling magistrates. "He feels persecuted, and fighting the judges
is what makes him happy."
Berlusconi's current point man is Nicolo Ghedini, a somber-faced, lanky 49-year-old criminal-
defense attorney from the northern city of Padua, who has served in both the Italian Senate and
the lower house of Parliament. Ghedini has continued to mount a grinding defense in the
criminal cases, arguing in the Mills case that Berlusconi cannot be present in the Milan
courtroom for the next several months because of time conflicts with his duties as Prime
Minister. Ghedini has also spearheaded an increasingly aggressive legal strategy that has
included several libel suits against opposition newspapers. He declared in September that if
necessary, Berlusconi would testify in a suit against a journalist who referred to rumors that the
Prime Minister is impotent. Last week, Berlusconi vowed to launch additional suits against
newspapers that printed unsubstantiated reports that a close adviser of his was involved in a 1993
bombing campaign by the Sicilian Mafia. (Read "An Offended Berlusconi Goes on the
Offensive.")

Despite these many legal headaches, Berlusconi is embroiled in one other particularly thorny
case that even he can't blame on overzealous magistrates. Veronica Lario, Berlusconi's wife of •
more than 20 years, filed for divorce earlier this year, which sparked an avalanche of accusations
that he frequented a prostitute from Bari and an underage model from Naples. The Milan daily
Corriere della Sera reported last week that Lario has demanded 3.5 million euros ($5.2 million)
in monthly payments, and Berlusconi countered with an offer of 300,000 euros ($450,000). No
matter how this and the other cases shake out, there is little hope that Berlusconi can avoid a
mountain of lawyers' fees and some grim Saturdays that he'd rather devote to other business and
pleasures.

The Parliamentary Labour Party meeting is just Over. Gordon has survived. The event, held in private,
was high drama and anticlimax at once. The chair asked for rebels to come forward and speak. Only
one prominent person emerged, Charles Clarke, former Home Secretary and Blairite; the rest were a
handful of about a half-dozen backbenchers. Their remarks about how Brown was bringing the party
down were poorly received. The party, after all, was in no mood for breaking ranks and rewarding
disloyalty. With this paltry showing, the opposition petered out, at least for now. Gordon then gave a
speech, strong on analysis, discussing that his government was paying the price for getting the
country through a difficult recession, suffering from the worst parliamentary crisis since Lloyd George
and still had a program to offer. He also make the point that when the party had split int he past it was
over ideology or policy and there were no stated differences presented by the opposition. So for now,
Gordon has won. Sid

Re: Latest articles on Iranian election fraud and CIA/torture
1. I've copied below texts of three articles you might not have seen. The first, by Juan Cole,
leading expert from University of Michigan on Iraq/Iran, lays out evidence so far on the
stolen election. Second, I've included the key graphs from Bill Keller's piece today in the
Times on same. And, third, Jane Mayer's article in the new issue of The New Yorker, out
tomorrow. (She sent me a digital copy.) The piece includes an interview with Panetta,
who himself discloses the internal administration debate—he was initially for a
commission but was overruled by Rabin and Axelrod.
2. On the Iranian election, the international press will obviously pursue the story of the
rigging of the vote, which will damage the legitimacy of regime. It's clear from reports
that even the Iranian man-on-the-street is affected by global public opinion and receives
international news through a wide variety of media. Ahmadinejad post-election continues
to ratchet up paranoia to consolidate support. After his statement and post-Bibi today,
there may be a remark to be made to address and defuse paranoia. If anything, whatever
the facts about the integrity of democracy in Iran, there is more reason than ever for all
sides to dispense with the politics of paranoia and discover that there are overriding
shared interests for peace, etc. But when to say anything depends upon how long to let
internal bitterness over the aftermath in Iran to simmer and the pressure from press for a
statement from you.
3. Jane Mayer's piece details the many moving and uncontrolled parts of the torture debate,
which has become chronic and will flare up again and again. The "distraction" will not go
away. I would avoid ever being drawn into commenting on any aspect.
4. One additional thought: The Iranian election points to the truism that things can
potentially go awry. Building up "the brand" of the president as the solvent for entangled
and often intractable diplomatic crises creates the basis for an opposite reaction. Raised
expectations can foster even greater disillusionment. After Lebanon's election, the US
press built up the magic of the brand as the new dynamic factor causing change. So
there's a fine line here to be walked. I would attribute positive changes or movements to
those people making them themselves, to the extent US commendation does not injure
their causes, and underline that a new global community will serve those and their
nation's interests who participate as active and responsible actors. But to reemphasize:

the danger of attributing any and all change in the world to presidential charisma is that
the bad will get assigned as well as the good.

Stealing the Iranian Election
Saturday 13 June 2009
by: Juan Cole I Visit article original @ Informed Comment
Top Pieces of Evidence that the Iranian Presidential Election Was Stolen
1.It is claimed that Ahmadinejad won the city of Tabriz with 57%. His main opponent, Mir
Hossein Mousavi, is an Azeri from Azerbaijan province, of which Tabriz is the capital. Mousavi,
according to such polls as exist in Iran and widespread anecdotal evidence, did better in cities
and is popular in Azerbaijan. Certainly, his rallies there were very well attended. So for an Azeri
urban center to go so heavily for Ahmadinejad just makes no sense. In past elections, Azeris
voted disproportionately for even minor presidential candidates who hailed from that province.
2.Ahmadinejad is claimed to have taken Tehran by over 50%. Again, he is not popular in the
cities, even, as he claims, in the poor neighborhoods, in part because his policies have produced
high inflation and high unemployment. That he should have won Tehran is so unlikely as to raise
real questions about these numbers. [Ahmadinejad is widely thought only to have won Tehran in
2005 because the pro-reform groups were discouraged and stayed home rather than voting.)
3.It is claimed that cleric Mehdi Karoubi, the other reformist candidate, received 320,000
votes, and that he did poorly in Iran's western provinces, even losing in Luristan. He is a Lur and
is popular in the west, including in Kurdistan. Karoubi received 17 percent of the vote in the first
round of presidential elections in 2005. While it is possible that his support has substantially
declined since then, it is hard to believe that he would get less than one percent of the vote.
Moreover, he should have at least done well in the west, which he did not.
4.Mohsen Rezaie, who polled very badly and seems not to have been at all popular, is alleged
to have received 670,000 votes, twice as much as Karoubi.
5.Ahmadinejad's numbers were fairly standard across Iran's provinces. In past elections there
have been substantial ethnic and provincial variations.
6.The Electoral Commission is supposed to wait three days before certifying the results of the
election, at which point they are to inform Khamenei of the results, and he signs off on the
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015
process. The three-day delay is intended to allow charges of irregularities to be adjudicated. In
this case, Khamenei immediately approved the alleged results.
I am aware of the difficulties of catching history on the run. Some explanation may emerge for
Ahmadinejad's upset that does not involve fraud. For instance, it is possible that he has gotten the
credit for spreading around a lot of oil money in the form of favors to his constituencies, but
somehow managed to escape the blame for the resultant high inflation.
But just as a first reaction, this post-election situation looks to me like a crime scene. And here
is how I would reconstruct the crime.
As the real numbers started coming into the Interior Ministry late on Friday, it became clear
that Mousavi was winning. Mousavi's spokesman abroad, filmmaker Mohsen Makhbalbaf.,
alleges > that the ministry even contacted Mousavi's camp and said it would begin preparing the
population for this victory. The ministry must have informed Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei,
who has had a feud with Mousavi for over 30 years, who found this outcome unsupportable.
And, apparently, he and other top leaders had been so confident of an Ahmadinejad win that they
had made no contingency plans for what to do if he looked as though he would lose.
They therefore sent blanket instructions to the Electoral Commission to falsify the vote counts.
This clumsy cover-up then produced the incredible result of an Ahmadinejad landlside in
Tabriz and Isfahan and Tehran.
The reason for which Rezaie and Karoubi had to be assigned such implausibly low totals was
to make sure Ahmadinejad got over 51% of the vote and thus avoid a run-off between him and
Mousavi next Friday, which would have given the Mousavi camp a chance to attempt to rally the
public and forestall further tampering with the election.
This scenario accounts for all known anomalies and is consistent with what we know of the
major players.
More in my column, just out, in Salon.com: More in my column, just out, in Salon.com:
"Ahmadinejad reelected under cloud of fraud," where I argue that the outcome of the presidential
elections does not and should not affect Obama's policies toward that country - they are the right
policies and should be followed through on regardless.
The public demonstrations against the result don't appear to be that big. In the past decade,
reformers have always backed down in Iran when challenged by hardliners, in part because no
one wants to relive the horrible Great Terror of the 1980s after the revolution, when faction-
fighting produced blood in the streets. Mousavi is still from that generation.
My own guess is that you have to get a leadership born after the revolution, who does not
remember it and its sanguinary aftermath, before you get people willing to push back hard
against the rightwingers.

So, there are protests against an allegedly stolen election. The Basij paramilitary thugs and the
Iranian Revolutionary Guards will break some heads. Unless there has been a sea change in Iran,
the theocrats may well get away with this soft coup for the moment. But the regime's legitimacy
will take a critical hit, and its ultimate demise may have been hastened, over the next decade or
two.
What I've said is full of speculation and informed guesses. I'd be glad to be proved wrong on
several of these points. Maybe I will be.
PS: Here's the data:
So here is what Interior Minister Sadeq Mahsouli said Saturday about the outcome of the
Iranian presidential elections:
"Of 39,165,191 votes counted (85 percent), Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won the election with
24,527,516 (62.63 percent)."
He announced that Mir-Hossein Mousavi came in second with 13,216,411 votes (33.75
percent).
Mohsen Rezaei got 678,240 votes (1.73 percent)
Mehdi Karroubi with 333,635 votes (0.85 percent).
He put the void ballots at 409,389 (1.04 percent).

Memo From Tehran
Reverberations as Door Slams on Hope of Change
By Bill Keller
On the street, the speculation focused more on how the election was manipulated, as many voters
insisted it must have been for Mr. Ahmadinejad to score such a preposterous margin of victory.
One version (from somebody's brother who supposedly knew someone inside) had it that vote
counters simply were ordered to doctor the numbers: "Make that 1,000 for Ahmadinejad a
3,000."
Others pointed out that the ballots seemed designed to lead opposition voters astray. Voters were
obliged to choose a candidate and fill in a code. Though Mr. Moussavi was candidate No. 4, the
code No. 44 signified Mr. Ahmadinejad.
One employee of the Interior Ministry, which carried out the vote count, said the government
had been preparing its fraud for weeks, purging anyone of doubtful loyalty and importing pliable
staff members from around the country.

"They didn't rig the vote," claimed the man, who showed his ministry identification card but
pleaded not to be named. "They didn't even look at the vote. They just wrote the name and put

Can Leon Panetta move the CIA. forward without confronting its past?
BY JANEMAYER
The Central Intelligence Agency
typically fights distant enemies, but
on May 21st its leaders were preoccupied
with a local opponent. A few miles
from the agency's headquarters, which
are in Langley, Virginia, former Vice-
President Dick Cheney delivered an extraordinary
attack on the Obama Administration's
emerging national-security
policies. Cheney, speaking at the American
Enterprise Institute, accused the
new Administration of making "the
American people less safe" by banning
brutal C.I.A. interrogations of terrorism
suspects that had been sanctioned by the
Bush Administration. Ruling out such
interrogations "is unwise in the extreme,"
Cheney charged. "It is recklessness
cloaked in righteousness."
Leon Panetta, the C.I.A.'s new director- •
and the man who bears much of the
responsibility for keeping the country
safe—learned the details of Cheney's
speech when he arrived in his office, on
the seventh floor of the agency's headquarters.
An hour earlier, he had been
standing at the side of President Barack
Obama, who was giving a speech at the
National Archives, in which he argued
that America could "fight terrorism while
abiding by the rule of law." In January,
the Obama Administration banned the
"enhanced" techniques that the Bush
Administration had approved for the
agency, including waterboarding and
depriving prisoners of sleep for up to
eleven days. Panetta, pouring a cup of
coffee, responded to Cheney's speech
with surprising candor. "I think he smells
some blood in the water on the nationalsecurity
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015
issue," he told me. "It's almost, a
little bit, gallows politics. When you read
•behind it, it's almost as if he's wishing
that this country would be attacked again,
in order to make his point. I think that's
dangerous politics."
Panetta was also absorbing criticism
from the left. The day before, a group of
progressive human-rights advocates had
been given an off-the-record briefing
with Obama, where they discussed his
plans for handling terrorism suspects;
some of the advocates were enraged at
what they saw as a tacit continuation of
the Bush approach. According to a participant,
Obama warned the group that
such comparisons were "not helpful."
Nevertheless, Kenneth Roth, the executive
director of Human Rights Watch,
who also attended the briefing, went on
to denounce the Administration for considering
"preventive detention"—incarcerating
certain terror suspects indefinitely,
without trial. Obama's position, Roth
said, "mimics the Bush Administration's
abusive approach."
Since January, the C.I.A. has become
the focus of almost daily struggle, as
Obama attempts to restore the rule of
law in America's fight against terrorism
without sacrificing safety or losing the
support of conservative Democratic and
independent voters. So far, he has insisted
on trying to recalibrate the agency's
policies without investigating past mistakes
or holding anyone responsible for
them. Caught in the middle is Panetta,
who is seventy years old and has virtually
no experience in the intelligence field.
Indeed, his credentials for running the
world's foremost spy agency are so unlikely
that when John Podesta, the head
of Obama's transition team, asked him to
take the job he responded, "Are you
sure?" Podesta assured Panetta that his
outsider status was actually an advantage:
"He said, 'You don't carry the scars of the
past eight years. Besides, the President
wants somebody who will talk straight to
him on these issues.' "
Although Panetta served briefly in the
military, half a century ago, his reputation
has been built almost entirely on his
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015
mastery of domestic policy. For sixteen
years, he was a Democratic congressman
from his home town, Monterey, California.
In 1989, he became the chairman of
the House Budget Committee, making
him a natural choice as President Bill
Clinton's first budget director. In 1994,
he became Clinton's chief of staff.
Panetta, the son of Italian immigrants,
grew up washing dishes in his parents' restaurant.
He is disarmingly forthright,
with an easy laugh; he is also a stern disciplinarian
and a workaholic. Colleagues
say that Panetta, who attends Mass regularly,
can be principled to the point of rigidity.
It was partly Panetta's rectitude
that got him the C.I.A. job. During the
Bush years, he decried the country's loss
of moral authority; in a blunt essay for
Washington Monthly last year, he declared
that Americans had been transformed
"from champions of human dignity and
individual rights into a nation of armchair
torturers." He concluded, "We either believe
in the dignity of the individual, the
rule of law, and the prohibition of cruel
and unusual punishment, or we don't.
There is no middle ground."
Panetta's impassioned essay unexpectedly
became an asset during the
Obama transition, after John Brennan—
the initial candidate for C.I.A.
director—was pressured to withdraw.
Critics accused Brennan, who had been
a top agency official during the Bush
years, of complicity with the torture
program. (A friend of Brennan's from
his C.I.A. days complained to me,
"After a few Cheeto-eating people in
the basement working in their underwear
who write blogs voiced objections
to Brennan, the Obama Administra-
tion pulled his name at the first sign of
smoke, and then ruled out a whole class
of people: anyone who had been at the
agency during the past ten years couldn't
pass the blogger test.")
Panetta had one other strong qualification:
he was close to Rahm Emanuel,
the new chief of staff. During the
Clinton Administration, Emanuel, serving
as the White House political director,
was suspected by former First Lady

information, and was very nearly fired.
Emanuel entered what he calls his "wilderness
period." When Panetta became
chief of staff, however, he reinstated
Emanuel as a top aide. "I thought he
had a lot of street smarts and good political
sense," Panetta told me.
In 1994, Panetta discovered, to his
dismay, that the President had quietly
turned to Dick Morris, a political consultant
with a dubious ethical reputation.
Harold Ickes, a former White
House aide, recalls Panetta walking the
halls late one night and saying that he
needed a shower after attending a meeting
with Morris. Later, a tabloid newspaper
reported that Morris had been
meeting with a prostitute in a nearby
Washington hotel. In 1997, Panetta left
the White House, by mutual agreement;
he and his wife, Sylvia, founded
the nonpartisan Panetta Institute for
Public Policy, in Northern California.
In January, 1998, it was revealed that
Clinton had conducted an extramarital
affair with Monica Lewinsky—Panetta's
former intern. An associate described
Panetta then as "very disappointed
in Bill Clinton, because of
Monica Lewinsky. He saw him as a
man with no personal discipline."
Eleven years later, Barack Obama
called Panetta for advice on who might
make a good chief of staff. Panetta recommended
Emanuel, telling him that
"Rahm knows the Hill, he certainly
knows the White House, and he's got
the tough side" necessary for the job. In
January, Emanuel recommended Panetta
for the C.I.A. post. Emanuel said
of Panetta, "Leon has great judgment, a
great compass.,He's a great manager, and
he's trusted by both parties." (Panetta
was a Republican until 1971.) Some former
C.I.A. officers, such as Tyler Drumheller,
who retired in 2005 as the head of
clandestine operations in Europe, welcome
the choice. "It's not such a bad
thing to have a powerful guy with access

to the President," he told me. Panetta, he
predicted, "will restore the integrity of
the intelligence process. After what we've
been through on Iraq and torture allegations,
that's a big deal."
Michael Waldman, who was President
Clinton's chief speechwriter, and
who now runs the Brennan Center for
Justice, at the New York University
School of Law, describes Panetta as
"one of the more honorable, decent, and
principled people in government," but
considers it "amazing that he was such
an outspoken critic" of the agency.
Given Panetta's reputation for integrity,
and the C.I.A.'s central role in the interrogations
scandal, Waldman wondered,
"can he ride the tiger without
being eaten?" He added, "An agency
like that can turn on a director. That's
the challenge: he's got to both lead it
and reform it."
The record of outsiders taking over the
C.I.A. is mixed. John McCone, a
California shipping magnate who ran the
agency in the Kennedy and Johnson years,
is often cited as being among the most
successful directors; having been trained as
a mechanical engineer, he was skilled at
assessing threats posed by both conventional
and nuclear weapons. But other
outsiders have been met with intense hostility.
James Schlesinger was named C.I.A.
director by President Richard Nixon after
heading the Atomic Energy Commission.
Given instructions to "get rid of the
clowns," Schlesinger dismissed or forced
into retirement more than five hundred
analysts and a thousand clandestine
officers. He faced death threats, and his
tenure lasted six months. In 1995, President
Clinton appointed John Deutch,
who had previously served at the Pentagon.
Deutch tried to improve the oversight
of clandestine operatives after evidence
surfaced that an agent in Guatemala
had covered up two murders. Deutch was
reviled by many operatives, and he left the
agency after eighteen months. Eventually,
he was accused of mishandling classified
documents and stripped of his security
clearance. "You pick on the C.I.A. at your
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015

own peril," Michael Waldman says.
Nevertheless, many critics believe
that the agency must reckon with the
legacy of the Bush era. In the past few
years, irrefutable evidence has emerged
that after 9/11 the agency lost its moral
bearings. A confidential Red Cross report
has come into public view, along
with formerly classified government
documents, leaving no doubt that the
agency subjected scores of terror suspects
to prolonged physical and psychological
cruelty. Officers shackled prisoners
for weeks in contorted positions;
chained them to the ceiling wearing
only diapers; exploited their phobias;
propelled them head first into walls. At
least three prisoners died.
Torture is a felony, and is sometimes
treated as a capital crime. The Convention
Against Torture, which America ratified
in 1994, requires a government to prosecute
all acts of torture; failure to do so is
considered a breach of international law.
The issue of torture assumed symbolic im-

portance during the 2008 campaign, and
when Obama took office many of his liberal
supporters expected him to hold the '
perpetrators of abuse accountable. Democratic
leaders in Congress pushed particularly
hard for action. Senator Carl Levin,
the chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
had investigated the military's role
in detention and interrogation abuse but
was kept by his committee's limited jurisdiction
from investigating the C.I.A.; he
urged the new Attorney General, Eric
Holder, to open an inquiry, saying, "There
needs to be an accounting of torture in this
country." Senator Patrick Leahy, the
chairman of the Judiciary Committee, argued
for the creation of an independent
"truth commission," which could grant
immunity to witnesses—thus helping to
insulate the Obama Administration from
charges that it was exploiting the torture
issue for partisan gain.
The C.I.A.'s role in providing misleading
intelligence about the presence
of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015
has also provoked calls for reform. Senator
Dianne Feinstein, the new chairman
of the Intelligence Committee,
told me, "There's no vote that I regret
more than the vote to authorize war
with Iraq"; her vote was based on intelligence
that she describes as "flat wrong."
Feinstein went on, "I am absolutely determined
to reform the process of gathering
and analyzing intelligence."
As soon as Obama took office, he overturned
most aspects of the Bush Administration's
interrogation policy. He issued
an executive order banning inhumane
treatment of prisoners by any government
officials, and one closing the C.I.A.'s network
of secret "black site" prisons, which
stretched from Poland to Thailand. He
also vowed to close the military prison in
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where fourteen
former C.I.A. prisoners are being held.
But Obama's message has been uncharacteristically
muddled on the question of accountability.
He has said that Attorney
General Holder should be the one to decide
whether to take criminal action; he
has also said that he would support further
congressional investigation, as long as it
was done in a bipartisan fashion. At the
same time, he has signalled that he has no
appetite for "looking backwards," and in
late April, during a private White House
meeting with congressional leaders, he rejected
the idea of an outside truth commission.
In the meantime, Republicans
have seized the political initiative, expressing
grave concern about the plans to close
Guantanamo and transfer the prisoners to
U.S. facilities.
Tim Weiner, the author of "Legacy
of Ashes," a recent history of the C.I.A.,
says that Panetta is facing a series of
"unappetizing choices." Weiner believes
that the country is in a period similar to
the Watergate era, when a series of disturbing
state secrets—such as the existence
of the Phoenix Program, a C.I.A.-
supported initiative, in which the South
Vietnamese were alleged to have tortured
civilians—spilled out. Speaking of
Panetta, he said, "It can't be comfortable
for a man who said, 'This is un-American,'
to be put in the position of saying,
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015
'Well, we hold no one accountable.'"
Panetta, whose conversation with me at
C.I.A. headquarters was his first
lengthy interview on the topic of abusive
interrogations, said that when he took
over the agency he "wanted to be damn
sure" that there was nobody on the payroll
who should be prosecuted for torture or
related crimes. He asked John Helgerson,
then the C.I.A.'s inspector general, to
conduct a review. In theory, the inspector
general is politically independent, and
therefore able to render unbiased judgments.
In 2004, Helgerson had written
a classified report on the C.I.A.'s secret
detention-and-interrogation program, in
which he questioned both the legality and
the effectiveness of the agency's brutally
coercive techniques. Panetta cited Helgerson's
"credibility" as a reason to trust his assessment.
According to Panetta, Helgerson,
who is not a lawyer, assured him that
no officer still at the agency had engaged
in actions that went beyond the legal
boundaries as they were understood during
the Bush years. Helgerson, who retired
from the agency in May, says he told
Panetta only that he was not aware of any
cases that merited prosecution, though
"continuing work was being done."
Panetta told me, "I'm going to give
people the benefit of the doubt. . . . If they
do the job that they're paid to do, I can't ask
for a hell of a lot more." His words echo
those of President Obama, who on April
16th promised immunity from prosecution
to any C.I.A. officer who relied on the
advice of legal counsel during the Bush
years. Jeffrey H. Smith, a former general
counsel to the C.I.A., points out that this
is a low standard, given that "what the Justice
Department approved was outrageous."
For example, for more than a century
the U.S. had prosecuted waterboarding
as a serious crime, and a ten-year prison
sentence was issued as recently as 1983. Indeed,
the memos authorizing interrogators
to torment prisoners clashed so glaringly
with international and U.S. law that some
of them were later withdrawn by lawyers in
Bush's own Justice Department.
Smith, who has advised Obama informally
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015
on how to handle the C.I.A.'s legacy
of abuse, thinks that prosecutions are
not politically viable at this point, and
would in any case be unfair to officers who
thought they were adhering to the law.
And many Republicans, from Newt Gingrich
to John McCain, have argued that
pressing charges against government
officials would threaten morale and inhibit
risk-talcing at a time when the agency
faces wars on two fronts and a continuing
threat from Al Qaeda. The Harvard law
professor Laurence Tribe disagrees. "It's
hard not to do something to those who
performed the act," he says. "It's not beyond
the pale to imagine that even people
armed with legal opinions might be held
legally responsible for violating the criminal
law in the area of torture."
Panetta told me, "Frankly, I didn't
support these methods that were used,
or the legal justification for why they did
it. . . . I also believed if I were to take this
job it was about dealing with the threats
that are out there, and trying to really
bring the C.I.A. into a new chapter." He
said that once he felt confident that
there was no criminal liability inside the
agency he "didn't want to spend a lot of
time dealing with the past and what
mistakes were made."
It turns out, however, that Panetta initially
supported the creation of a truth
commission. "I'm not big on commissions,"
Panetta told me. "On the other
hand, I could see that it might make some
sense, frankly, to appoint a high-level
54 THE NEW YORKER, JUNE 22, 2009
commission, with somebody like Sandra
Day O'Connor, Lee Hamilton—people
like that." The appeal was that Obama
could delegate to others the legal problems
stemming from Bush Administration actions,
allowing him to focus on his ambitious
political agenda. "In the discussion
phase"—early in the spring, before Obama
decided the issue—"I was for it," Panetta
said. "Because every time a question came
up, you could basically say, 'The commission,
hopefully, is looking at this.' "But by
late April Obama had vetoed the idea,
fearing that it would look vindictive and,
possibly, inflame his predecessor. "It was
the President who basically said, 'If I do
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015
this, it will look like I'm trying to go after
Cheney and Bush,' "Panetta said. "He just
didn't think it made sense. And then everybody
kind of backed away from it."
Ken Gude, an associate director at the
Center for American Progress, who specializes
in national-security issues, and who
has close ties to the White House, believes
that Obama's instinct, like Panetta's, was
to set up a truth commission of some sort.
"I think the political staff walked it back,"
he says. "They said it would be a distraction."
Obama's political advisers dread any
issue that could trigger a culture war and
diminish his support among independent
voters. They also see little advantage in
picking a fight with the C.I.A. But the decision
to discourage an accountability process,
Gude says, has backfired. The Administration
has lost control of the story, as
revelations about C.I.A. misdeeds have
continued to emerge through lawsuits and
the press. "It's now become the distraction
they wanted to avoid," Gude says. "The
White House briefings have been dominated
by questions about releasing documents
and photos." It's understandable, he
says, that Obama wouldn't want to spend
his energy on Bush's mistakes. But, he
warns, "they can't leave the impression that
they're trying to cover it up."
Panetta may not have scars from the
past eight years, but he is surrounded
by people who do. Some of his closest
advisers have connections to the torture
program. Panetta brought only one person
with him to the agency: Jeremy
Bash, the well-regarded former chief
counsel to the House Intelligence Committee,
who now serves as his chief of
staff. Phil Trounstine, a California-based
political consultant and analyst who has
known Panetta for years, says of him,
"Here's a guy who has been very critical
of the Bush world view, who has to enforce
a new set of guidelines and policies
by leading the same agency and the same
people as in the past."
Several of Panetta's top deputies worked
closely with George Tenet, the agency's
director from 1997 until 2004. Under
Tenet, the C.I.A. took the lead role in
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015
fighting terrorism, and its officers became
the jailers, and sometimes the tormentors,
of many U.S.-held detainees. Tenet, who
is now a managing director of the investment
bank Allen & Company, has all but
disappeared from public sight in Washington.
He recently cancelled an appearance
scheduled at the Panetta Institute this
month. ("George has not wanted to do
stuff in front of a camera," Panetta noted.)
But in his 2007 memoir, "At the Center of
the Storm," Tenet defended the use of
"enhanced" interrogation techniques on
terror suspects, claiming that the information
they elicited had prevented other attacks
and saved American lives. (He also
assured President Bush that the case for
going to war in Iraq was "a slam dunk.")
But a former senior agency official who
worked with many of Tenet's top team
members says, "These people carried out
this policy. . . but they'll muddy the waters
by explaining why what they did was O.K.
They will say that 'Bush was bad' but they
weren't. A lot of it is just to protect their
own positions. It's amazing to me that all
these Tenet people survived!"
Behind Panetta's desk—next to a
framed, tattered American flag that was
rescued from the ruins of the World
Trade Center—is a door leading to the
office of Stephen Kappes, whom Panetta
has kept on as the agency's second-incommand.
Kappes, a former U.S. marine,
is widely admired within the agency, in
particular for his role in persuading the
Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi to
abandon his nuclear-weapons program, in
2003. "Kappes is the case officer's case
officer," John Radsan, who was a lawyer at
the C.LA. during President Bush's first
term, says. Intense, serious, and fluent in
Russian and Farsi, Kappes has served as a
station chief in Moscow, New Delhi, and
Frankfurt, and has supervised many clandestine
operations. In April, President
Obama paid a visit to C.I.A. headquar-
ters and singled out Kappes as the wise
"graybeard" in the building. Senator Fein-
stein insisted to Obama Administration
officials privately that Kappes continue as
deputy director; it was a condition of her
support for Panetta, whose lack of experience
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015
in covert operations she questioned.
During the first term of the Bush Administration,
Kappes was a top official
in the Directorate of Operations. This
group oversaw the agency's Counterterrorist
Center, which, in turn, managed
the secret detention-and-interrogation
program. Few doubt that he was aware
that the C.I.A. was engaging in brutality.
One former officer recalls that Kappes
voiced qualms, warning that the program
amounted to "torture." According to the
former officer, once Kappes was overruled
he went along; Kappes was "the brains" of
the directorate, the former officer says.
(Kappes, through a spokesman, denied
having had a direct role in the interrogation
program, or having called its tactics
torture.) Another former C.I.A. operative
says, "It would be hard to say someone so
involved could be robustly objective" in
advising Panetta.
Panetta says that most of the individuals
who managed the secret interrogation
program have since left the agency. One of
the holdovers is Jonathan Fredman, who
was formerly the chief counsel to the division
that ran the interrogation program;
he is now on temporary assignment with
the director of National Intelligence. According
to notes from a 2002 meeting,
which were disclosed at a recent Senate
hearing, Fredman advised that torture "is
basically subject to perception. If the detainee
dies, you're doing it wrong." The
notes, whose accuracy Fredman has disputed,
describe him saying that videotapes
of interrogations would look "ugly." Fredman's
former boss is John A. Rizzo, the
C.I.A.'s acting general counsel, who
was the recipient of many of the Justice
Department's torture memos. (Rizzo is
scheduled to leave the agency once a replacement
has been confirmed.) And the
current head of the Counterterrorist Center—
the officer, who is undercover, cannot
be identified—ran the interrogation
program for part of Bush's second term.
Several current station chiefs and division
chiefs were also deeply involved in brutal
interrogations, as were pilots, logistical experts,
medical personnel, and others.
Meanwhile, John Brennan—the man
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015
who was considered too politically toxic for
the top C.I.A. job—has become a senior
official on the National Security Council.
Brennan, who, as one former C.I.A. officer
puts it, was once "joined to George Tenet
at the hip"—he served as Tenet's chief of
staff—now advises Obama on terrorism
and other national-security issues. He has •
reportedly lobbied hard to maintain secrecy
on past abuses. According to Newsweek,
Brennan recently persuaded Panetta
to join him in protesting Obama's plan to
release four shocking Justice Department
memos about the interrogation program.
The documents, written by lawyers in the
Office of Legal Counsel, showed that the
C.I.A. had waterboarded one suspect at
least a hundred and eighty-three times and
subjected many others to harrowing mistreatment.
Opponents have argued that
exposing such details could spark an anti-
American backlash. Panetta also argued
forcefully in favor of indemnifying any
C.I.A. officers whose actions, as described
in the memos, might have opened them
up to criminal charges.
Several well-respected former C.I.A.
officials—including Fred Hitz, a former
inspector general, and Paul Pillar, a former
Middle East analyst—told me that •
they saw no harm in releasing the documents.
Dennis C. Blair, the director of
National Intelligence, who oversees the
U.S. intelligence establishment, including
the C.I.A., also supported the release
of the documents, after his staff concluded
that the disclosures would likely
do no damage.
After intense consideration, and a latenight
meeting in Rahm Emanuel's office,
Obama rejected Panetta's arguments for
secrecy, deciding that it was in the public
interest to release the memos. But Obama
also endorsed the notion of giving blanket
amnesty to any C.I.A. officers performing
authorized work.
Panetta's resistance to public disclosure
seemed out of character to some longtime
colleagues. "I was surprised by Leon's
position on the O.L.C. memos," Phil
Trounstine told me. "It's tough to maintain
your principles when you're head of
the C.I.A., because you need to be seen as
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015
someone that the people inside the agency
want to follow." Panetta had become an
advocate for secrecy so quickly, a White
House official joked, that "it's like 'Invasion
of the Body Snatchers.'"
Panetta's advisers may have had a personal
stake in opposing transparency. Another
former C.I.A. official, who knows
Brennan well, noted that, if the Bush torture
program were to be further investigated,
"potentially, both Brennan and
Kappes could have a lot to lose." Brennan's
supporters have argued that he had no operational
control over the interrogation
program, and point out that his tenure
as Tenet's chief of staff ended in March,
2001, before the Al Qaeda attacks. But he
was subsequently named deputy executive
director, and served in that position until
March, 2003—the period when the most
brutal detainee treatment occurred. In addition,
Brennan often briefed President
Bush about daily developments in the war
on terror. Brennan has described himself
as an internal critic of waterboarding—a
position that friends, such as Emile Nakhleh,
a former senior officer, confirm. Yet,
in an interview with me two years ago,
Brennan defended the use of "enhanced"
interrogation techniques and extraordinary
renditions,
in which the C.I.A. abducted
terror suspects around the globe
and transported them to other countries to
be jailed and interrogated; many of those
countries had execrable human-rights records.
He also questioned some people's
definition of "torture." "I think it's torture
when I have to ride in the car with my kids
and they have loud rap music on," he said.
Asked if "enhanced" interrogation techniques
were necessary to keep America
safe, he replied, "Would the U.S. be handicapped
if the C.I.A. was not, in fact, able
to carry out these types of detention and
debriefing activities? I would say yes."
Anthony Lake, who was the national-
security adviser under Clinton,
said of Brennan, "I've known John a long
time, and he's a really good guy. I would
argue, you can't throw out the whole
agency." Lake, in fact, recommended
Brennan to the Obama campaign when
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015
it was looking for intelligence advisers—
after consulting with their mutual friend
George Tenet. America's intelligence
community is an incestuous one, making
it difficult for a President to break
with old ways of thinking.
Indeed, a well-informed analyst with
close ties to the White House says that the
C.I.A. has been lobbying hard to get
Obama to support some form of preventive
detention for terror suspects. An agency
spokesman denies this. But the analyst
56 THE NEW YORKER, JUNE 22, 2009
says, "They definitely want the flexibility to
hold people in some form of detention.
They have been saying, 'We need deep
authorities.' They've been presenting the
President with nightmare scenarios."
Panetta, for his part, has been persuaded
that renditions are a tool worth
keeping. The rendition program began, in
a more carefully monitored form, during
the Clinton Administration, but in the
Bush years it was transformed into what
John Radsan, the former C.I.A. lawyer,
called "an abomination." As many as
seven detainees were misidentified and
abducted by mistake; many other suspects
have alleged that they were hideously tortured
by foreign governments. Panetta
told me, "The worst part of rendition was
rendition to a black site. That will not be
the case anymore. If we render someone,
it will be to a country with jurisdiction
over that individual." During the Bush
years, however, some of the most horrific
allegations of abuse were made by detainees
rendered not to black sites but to
Egypt, Syria, and Morocco. The Obama
Administration, Panetta says, will take
precautions to insure that rendered suspects
are treated humanely, as the law requires.
"I've talked to the State Department,
and our people have to make very
sure that people won't be mistreated," Panetta
said. "Some places, obviously, it's
more difficult to do. But we're going to
have to press to make sure it doesn't happen,
because it would fly in the face of everything
the President has said we stand
for." The Bush Administration professed
to be taking similar precautions.
The C.I.A. has apparently done nothing
to penalize the officer who oversaw one
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015
of the most notorious renditions—that of
a German car salesman named Khaled el-
Masri. He was abducted while on a holiday
in Macedonia, and flown by the agency
to Afghanistan, where he was detained in
a dungeon for five months without charges,
before being released. From the start, the
rendition team suspected that his case was
one of mistaken identity. But the C.I.A.
officer in charge at Langley—the agency
asked that the officer's name be withheld—
insisted that Masri be further interrogated.
"She just looked in her crystal ball
and it said that he was bad," a colleague recalls.
Masri says that he was chained in a
freezing cell with no bed, and given water
so putrid that he could smell it across the
room. He was threatened and stripped,
and could hear other detainees crying all
around him. After several weeks, the
C.I.A. officer in charge learned that Masri's
German passport was not a forgery, as
was originally suspected, and that he was
not the terror suspect the agency thought
he was. (The names were similar.) Even so,
the officer in charge refused to release him.
Eventually, Masri went on a hunger strike,
losing sixty pounds. Skeptics in the agency
went directly over the officer's head to
Tenet, who realized that his agency had
been brutalizing an innocent man. Masri
was released after a hundred and forty-nine
days. But the officer in charge was not disciplined;
in fact, a former colleague says,
"she's been promoted—twice." Masri,
meanwhile, has been unable to sue the
U.S. government for either an apology or
damages, because the courts consider the
very existence of rendition a state secret—
a position that the Obama Justice Department
has so far supported.
No criminal charges have ever been
brought against any C.I.A. officer involved
in the torture program, despite the
fact that at least three prisoners interrogated
by agency personnel died as the result
of mistreatment. In the first case, an
unnamed detainee under C.I.A. supervision
in Afghanistan froze to death after
having been chained, naked, to a concrete
floor overnight. The body was buried in
an unmarked grave. In the second case, an
Iraqi prisoner named Manadel al-Jamadi

interrogated by the C.I.A. at Abu Ghraib
prison, outside Baghdad. A forensic examiner
found that he had essentially been
crucified; he died from asphyxiation after
having been hung by his arms, in a hood,
and suffering broken ribs. Military pathologists
classified the case a homicide.
A third prisoner died after an interrogation
in which a C.I.A. officer participated,
though the officer evidently did not cause
the death. (Several other detainees have
disappeared and remain unaccounted for,
according to Human Rights Watch.)
During his tenure at the C.I.A., John
Helgerson, the former inspector general,
forwarded the crucifixion case, along with
an estimated half-dozen other incidents, to
the Justice Department, for possible prosecution.
But the case files have languished.
An official familiar with the cases told me
that the agency has deflected inquiries by
the Senate Intelligence Committee seeking
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015
information about any internal disciplinary
action. (Helgerson told me, "Some
individuals have been disciplined. And
others no longer work at the agency.")
Panetta acknowledges that there are
some people still at the C.I.A. who may be
tainted by the torture program. Nevertheless,
he says, "I really respect the people
who say we shouldn't have gotten involved
in the interrogation business but we had to
do our jobs. I don't think I should penalize
people who were doing their duty. If
you have a President who exercises bad
judgment, the C.I.A. pays the price."
On June 1st, former Vice-President
Cheney asserted in a speech that the
C.I.A., rather than the White House, first
proposed hurting prisoners during interrogations.
"It was their initiative," he said.
"They had a couple of cases where they
thought enhanced interrogation techniques
would provide information." Panetta
has a different view. "There is no
question in my mind," he said. "The interrogation
thing, to some extent, was cast
upon us, because the military walked away
from it, and the F.B.I. walked away from
it, and so everybody came down on the
C.I.A.," he said. This is technically true, although
the F.B.I. "walked away" from interrogations
of terrorism suspects after its
director, Bob Mueller, heard complaints
from an agent, Ali Soufan, that the C.I.A.'s
interrogation methods amounted to "borderline
torture." John Helgerson told me
that he holds the the Pentagon,
and the White House equally responsible:
"They went arm in arm into it."
Without a thorough public investigation,
it's difficult to assess the truth behind
such contradictory accusations. "Everyone
says, 'It's over, it's known,' "Nathaniel
Raymond, who works with the advocacy
group Physicians for Human Rights, told
me. "But what is known? We still don't
know how many detainees were in the
black sites, or who they were. We don't
fully know the White House's role, or the
C.I.A.'s role. We need a full accounting,
especially as it relates to health professionals."
The recently released Justice Department
memos, he noted, contain numerous
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015
references to C.I.A. medical personnel
participating in coercive interrogation
sessions. "They were the designers, the
legitimizers, and the implementers,"
Raymond said. "This is arguably the single
greatest medical-ethics scandal in
American history. We need answers."
Some conservatives are also calling for
greater openness. Will Taft, the general
counsel to the State Department in the
Bush Administration, told me, "There are
some twenty or thirty people whom the
My eyes each day thaw.
One day the water cuts off.
Then back on.
They are outside dogs—
which is to say, healthy
& victorious, purposeful
& one giant muscle

them not to bark, to point
out their prey. To stay.
Were they there that day?
They call me
like witnesses & will not say.
I ask for their care
& their carelessness—
wish of them forgiveness.
I must give them away.
I must find for them homes,
sleep restless in his.
All night I expect they pace
as I do, each dog like an eye
roaming with the dead
beneath an unlocked lid.

C.I.A. said it formerly held but no longer
does. Those names have never been released.
The government should identify
all the people in the program and account
for them."
The Senate Intelligence Committee
recently embarked on its own, closed-door
investigation of the torture program; Panetta
told me that he has been assured that
the committee members' work "would be
about lessons learned, as opposed to going
after people." So the C.I.A. is "cooperating
with them, giving them whatever information
they need to try to conduct their
review." He says that the committee has
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015
already identified some ten million relevant
documents. "It's going to take a
while," he said.
The Senate investigation will, among
other things, probe the question of torture's
efficacy. Dick Cheney has repeatedly
claimed that "enhanced" interrogations
yield results. Opponents say that torture is
counterproductive. Panetta is more agnostic.
He told me, "The bottom line would
be this: Yes, important information was
gathered from these detainees. It provided
information that in fact was acted upon.
Was this the only way to obtain this information?
I think that will always be an open
question." But he is certain that "we did
pay a price for using those methods."
A number of recently released documents
call into question the notion that the
C.I.A. played a passive role in relation to
torture policy. A 2008 report by the Senate
Armed Services Committee indicates
that the agency hired contract psychologists
who went on to design and implement
specific forms of abuse—such as
locking a detainee, doubled up, in a tiny,
airless cage—months before August, 2002,
when the Justice Department granted legal
authorization with its infamous "torture
memo." More troublingly, footnotes in the
Office of Legal Counsel memos suggest
that some C.I.A. interrogators may have
egregiously exceeded the legal boundaries
set down by the Justice Department and
the White House—which seemingly puts
them outside the legal safety zone demarcated
by Obama and Panetta. In 2002, the
Bush Administration authorized interrogators
to re-create the ostensibly safe waterboarding
techniques used in military
training. But, instead of limiting the sessions
to a maximum of two twenty-second
bouts of controlled drowning, as prescribed
in military training, the C.I.A. interrogators
forced one detainee to undergo at least
a hundred and eighty-three sessions, and
another at least eighty-three. And, instead
of using a very small amount of water, as
the Justice Department stipulated, the
C.I.A. interrogators subjected the detainees
to "large volumes" of water. The memos
quote Inspector General Helgersott's
finding, in his secret 2004 report on coercive
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762308 Date: 06/30/2015
techniques, that the interrogators
amplified the pain deliberately, in order to
make the sensation of drowning "more
poignant and convincing." Helgerson also
found that the psychologists and interrogators
who designed the agency's protocols—
and who claimed that their judgments
were based on knowledge of military
standards—had "probably misrepresented"
their "expertise." In addition, the C.I.A.'s
Office of Medical Services found that
there was "no reason to believe that applying
the waterboard with the frequency and
intensity with which it was used by the
psychologist/interrogators . . was either
efficacious or medically safe."
In April, Panetta fired all the C.I.A.'s
contract interrogators, including the former
military psychologists who appear to
have designed the most brutal interrogation
techniques: James Mitchell and
Bruce Jessen. The two men, who ran a
consulting company, Mitchell, Jessen &
Associates, had recommended that interrogators
apply to detainees theories of
"learned helplessness" that were based on
experiments with abused dogs. The firm's
principals reportedly billed the agency a
thousand dollars a day for their services.
"We saved some money in the deal, too!"
Panetta said. (Remarkably, a month after
Obama took office the C.I.A. had signed
a fresh contract with the firm.)
According to ProPublica, the investigative
reporting group, Mitchell and Jessen's
firm, which in 2007 had a hundred
and twenty people on its staff, recently
closed its offices, in Spokane, Washington.
One employee was Deuce Martinez,
a former C.I.A. interrogator in the blacksite
program; Joseph Matarazzo, a former
president of the American Psychological
Association, was on the company's board.
(According to Kirk Hubbard, the former
head of the C.I.A.'s research and analysis
"I've put everything in your name in case my creditors come after me."
• •
THE NEW YORKER, JUNE 22, 2009 59
division, Matarazzo served on an agency
professional-standards board during the
time the interrogation program was set
up, but was not consulted about the

Lawsuits against abusive contractors
remain a possibility, and any one of them
could expose a line of authorizations leading
directly up the chain of command at
the C.I.A., and into the Bush White
House. George Brent Mickum IV, a lawyer
representing Abu Zubaydah, a C.I.A.
prisoner who was repeatedly waterboarded,
said, "I'd like to sue Mitchell and
Jessen in a minute." (Mitchell was an adviser
on Zubaydah's interrogation.) After
Zubaydah was waterboarded, his lawyers
say, his mental state deteriorated, and he
has since been prescribed the antipsychotic
drug Haldol.
Few activists expect lawsuits against
the C.I.A. or its contractors to succeed.
But John Sifton, an attorney who specializes
in human-rights law, and who is part
of Zubaydah's legal team, notes that there
are other ways for the detainees' grievances
to become public. "The act of prosecuting
the high-value detainees will be
the accountability process," Sifton said.
"It's impossible to try these detainees
without allowing them to air all the information
about their torture."
Other legal actions threaten to expose
yet more secrets of the C.I.A.'s torture
program. A prosecutor appointed by
the Justice Department, John Durham, has
convened a grand jury in Washington to
weigh potential criminal charges against
C.I.A. officers who were involved in
the destruction of ninety-two videotapes
documenting the interrogations of Abu
Zubaydah and other detainees. Mickum
told me that he has met several times with
Durham, and believes that the scope of his
inquiry may have expanded to include a review
of whether the C.I.A. began using
brutal methods on Zubaydah before it received
written authorization from the Justice
Department. (This would provide an
extra motive for destroying the videotapes.)
Mickum said, "I got the sense he was very
serious." (Durham declined to comment.)
The A.C.L.U., meanwhile, is suing to get
access to classified descriptions of what was
on the destroyed videotapes. Last week,
Panetta filed an affidavit opposing the disclosure,
which he said "could be expected

to result in exceptionally gave damage to
the national security." Once again, he was
protecting Bush-era interrogation secrets.
Pressure is also coming from abroad.
In Italy, two dozen C.I.A. officers are on
trial in absentia for participating in a 2003
rendition. Robert Seldon Lady, the agency's
station chief in Milan at the time, can
no longer travel to Italy without danger of
arrest, nor can the other C.I.A. officers
named in the case. Spain has opened a
criminal investigation of six Bush Administration
officials in connection with torture.
And in London a former rendition
victim is suing the British authorities.
After a British judge ruled that the
plaintiff; Binyam Mohammed, should be
given access to C.I.A. intelligence documents
that the agency shared with British
authorities, the Obama Administration
surprised liberals by pressuring the British
government to stop the disclosures.
Several other legal challenges to the
agency's interrogation program are working
their way through the U.S. court system.
A judge in California recently rejected
the Justice Department's claims of
blanket state secrecy in a case brought by
five rendition victims against Jeppesen
Dataplan, a subsidiary of Boeing, which
provided the flight plans for the C.I.A.'s
renditions. In a press conference in April,
Obama indicated that he had had second
thoughts about the Justice Department's
assertion of blanket state secrecy in the
case, but on June 12th the Administration
reasserted its original claim.
Earlier this month, Philip Mudd,
Obama's nominee for a top Homeland
Security post, withdrew from consideration
after it became clear that his Senate
confirmation would turn into a fight over
his previous role in the C.I.A.'s interrogation
program. Rahm Emanuel, speaking
of the many challenges posed by the torture
scandal, told me, "It's a day-to-day—
I won't say struggle—but problem. There
are a lot of cases in the queue that require
response. Many of them. But I've seen the
President in the Situation Room, and I
know he wants to move forward."
Panetta is already forging ahead on one
important reform: he plans to replace the

abusive interrogation program with a legally
acceptable, non-coercive alternative.
A task force led by the Harvard Law
School professor Philip Heymann has
been advising him on a proposal to create
an elite U.S. government interrogation
team, staffed by some of the best C.I.A.,
F.B.I., and military officers in the country,
and drawing on the advice of social scientists,
linguists, and other scholars. "What
I'm pushing for is to establish a facility
where we develop a team of interrogators
trained in the latest techniques," Panetta
said. "That's the one thing I'm worried
about, frankly. There just aren't that many
people who have the interrogation abilities
we're going to need." Heymann describes
the effort to create "the best non-coercive
interrogation team in the world" as the
equivalent of "a NASA-like, man-on-themoon
effort" for human-intelligence gathering.
He said that members of his task
force have travelled to France, England,
Japan, Australia, and Israel, in order to
compile comparative information on what
interrogators do. "We also went to the best
people in the U.S.," he added.
Panetta has many ambitions for his tenure
at the agency. He spoke to me of the
need for the C.I.A. to increase its foreignlanguage
skills, and to recruit officers of
more diverse backgrounds, who can more
easily infiltrate hostile parts of the world.
But, as Panetta sees it, the C.I.A.'s effort to
"disrupt, destroy, and dismantle" Al Qaeda
remains its top priority. The agency continues
to acquire intelligence suggesting
that Al Qaeda is planning attacks on America,
he told me. "We're conducting pretty
robust operations in Pakistan, and I think
we're doing a good job of trying to disrupt
Al Qaeda. But, clearly, that is a threat."
The greatest danger, he said, is that Al
Qaeda will "find other safe havens to go
to," in states such as Somalia and Yemen.
"Our mission is to make sure they can't find
a place to hide." Finding and bringing
to justice Al Qaeda's leaders—in particular,
Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-
Zawahiri—"remains
a focal point," Panetta
said. "It's not easy, as you can imagine."
Last week, the Times reported on escalating

friction over jurisdiction between
Panetta and Dennis Blair, the National
Intelligence director. "I'm surprised at
the number of challenges you have to
confront in this job," Panetta confided.
"You're a traffic cop, in many ways."
When he was the White House chief of
staff, Panetta said, he could delegate the
big decisions to the President. "Here,
though," he said, gazing out over the
C.I.A.'s serene grounds, "the decisions
come to me. And a lot of them involve life
and death." Sometimes, he added, all
he can do is "say a lot of Hail Marys." o

FYI, Gary Sick's latest analysis on Iran below (posted on his blog). Sick has independent sources and
is very well informed.
June 17, 2009
Is this another Iranian revolution?
To someone who has watched and studied the Iranian revolution of 1979 with fascination, developments
in Iran today have an eerie reminiscence. Then there were massive protests that filled the streets, often
marching in dignified but ominous silence; there was bloodshed as nervous security men with guns faced
determined but unarmed crowds; there were sullen mourning parades;20there were catchy chants and
ritual calls of "Down with the shah!"; at night the rooftops rang with shouts of allahu akbar.
You need only change "shah" to "dictator," and you have a description of what is happening in Iran
today.
But there is one very big difference. Thirty years ago, Iran had a charismatic cleric named Ayatollah
Khomeini who had a refined sense of strategy and a willingness to risk everything for the cause he
represented. On the other side was Mohammed Reza Shah, who had been on the throne for some 37
years and who commanded one of the most powerful military and security regimes in the world. On the
surface it appeared to be an uneven battle — guns against turbans — but the ruler with the guns wavered
and the turbans grew in size and confidence until the old order collapsed.
Today the nominal leader of the opposition forces is a reformed radical, Mir Hossein Mousavi, who is
notably lacking in personal charisma. On the other side is the constitutional Leader, Ayatollah
IChamene' i, who is widely perceived as a cautious political animal with limited qualifications for his
religious post and who compensates for his own lack of charisma by manipulation of the political system
and the institutions most loyal to him — particularly the politically minded clergy and the powerful
security forces, including the Revolutionary Guards.
Neither of these men seems to be fully in control of their own forces, let alone the situation. The
fraudulent election defeat of Mousavi was a triggering event, but the energy behind these unprecedented
demonstrations is due more to the sense of outrage and betrayal at the gross manipulation of numbers by
the regime than it is about any undying devotion to Mousavi. Yesterday Mousavi ordered that people
stay home in face of a conflicting pro-regime demonstration. They marched anyway (and the daughter of
former president Rafsanjani joined them and urged them on). Mousavi then "ordered" everyone to
march the following day (which they were probably going to do with or without his orders).
IChamene'i announced the "divine assessment" of the election outcome — even before it would probably
have been physically possible to count the more than 40 million ballots. Then, in the face of mass protests,
he ordered an investigation of the results by the Guardian Council— the same organization that was
responsible for managing the election in the first place. No one believed him in either case, and no one
expected anything of importance from the Guardian Council. Khamene'i has ordered peace and
reconciliation. No one paid any attention.
I deliberately did not mention president-elect Ahmadinejad. After celebrating his "victory," he went off
to a largely symbolic meeting in Moscow. He seems to be out of the decision loop and more of a passive
player than a major actor in these events.
So who is calling the shots? Mousavi seems to be running along after the crowd, not leading it. But that is
probably all that is required to keep the protest in motion.

On the other side, the very little evidence we have suggests that the important decisions are being made
by the ultra-conservative leadership of the Revolutionary Guards, whose political role has ballooned over
the past decade, perhaps in cooperation with their extremist counterparts in the clergy. They are utterly
ruthless and ideologically fueled.
New York Times columnist Nick Kristoff reminded us several days ago (see blog item on June 15 below)
at the end of the day, as I saw at Tiananmen 20 years ago, when Might and Right do battle, it's often prudent
to bet on Might, at least in the short run.
The regime seems to have miscalculated badly. They seemed to believe that a sudden coup — the
announcement of dramatic election results followed by a show of force — would intimidate and silence the
opposition and consolidate their control. That is perhaps more understandable if the decisions were being
made by military leaders who tend to see the battle in Manichaean terms, rather than politicians such as
IChamene'i who are accustomed to seeing shades of gray. In any event, it b ackfired and they now have a
much larger crisis on their hands than if they had simply arranged for Ahmadinejad to win by a slim
margin (which was at least believable).
All parties are now in uncharted territory. A significant portion of the Iranian population seems to have
concluded that their social contract with the rulers — accepting Islamic rule in return for a respectful
regard for the opinion of the governed, an Islamic Republic — is no longer valid. They do not trust their
rulers.
The rulers, whose support has been declining for years in the face of their own inept management of the
country, are increasingly replacing popular support with repression. This election seems to have called
that tactic into question. For the military, the obvious answer is more repression. So it would appear to
be a moment to bet on Might.
But nobody is fully in command of events. Decisions taken in the next weeks will be fateful and could
determine the future path of the Iranian revolution.
There is another lesson as Iran's leaders contemplate a Tiananmen moment. When the Tiananmen
crackdown occurred almost exactly ten years ago, one of the leaders of China at the time was Zhao
Ziyang, General Secretary of the Communist Party. He was later fired and placed under house arrest.
His smuggled memoirs have just appeared, revealing the depth of disagreements within the lea dership
about how to proceed.
Is it possible that ten years from now we will have a volume describing the intense debates that one can
only presume are underway today in the highest councils of the Islamic Republic of Iran?

Day of Mourning, Protests, Called by Mousavi on Thursday
Mir-Hosain Mousavi, who maintains he won last Friday's presidential election despite official assertions that he
lost 2 to 1 to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is calling for another rally Thursday, this time in part to honor the
persons killed by hardliners or security forces in the course of previous demonstrations.
Mourning the martyr is as central to Iranian Shiite religious culture as it was to strains of medieval Catholicism
in Europe, and Mousavi's camp is tapping into a powerful set of images and myths here. The archetypal Shiite
martyr is Imam Husayn, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, who championed oppressed Muslims in Iraq
and was cut down by the then Umayyad Muslim Empire. Redognition that a Muslim state might commit the
ultimate in sacrilege by beheading a person who had been dangled on the Prophet's knee has imbued modern
political Shiism with a distrust of the state. When Husayn's head was brought to the Umayyad caliph Yazid and
deposited before his throne, older companions of the Prophet are said to have wept and remarked, "I saw the
Prophet's lips on those cheeks." Shiites ritually march, flagellate, and chant in honor of the martyred Imam or
divinely-appointed leader.
Today's protesters are wearing green, which symbolizes Mousavi's descent from the Prophet Muhammad.
(Mousavi's family name refers to the Seventh Imam (descendant of the Prophet with claims to divine
knowledge), Musa Kazim, whose tomb is in Kazimiya, north Baghdad. Sayyid families, those claiming descent
from the Prophet, often take one of the Imams' names as a family name to honor them, though of course they
are also claiming descent from the previous Imams right back to the Prophet.) The repertoires of protest the
reformists are using echo those of the 1978-79 Islamic Revolution-- they are chanting "God is Great," mourning
pious fallen martyrs, etc.-- another sign that this movement is not just alienated secularized elites.
But now Mousavi's his supporters are also sporting black ribbons to indicate that they are in mourning for the
fallen. Typically, the dead will be commemorated again at one month and at 40 days. In 1978 such
demonstrations for those killed in previous demonstrations grew in size all through the year, till they reached an
alleged million in the streets of Tehran. Since the reformists are already claiming Monday's rally was a million,
you wonder where things will go from here.
The regime's attempt to paint the protesters as nothing more than US intelligence agents underlines how wise
President Obama has been not to insert himself forcefully into the situation in Iran. The reformers and the hard
liners are not stable groupings. The core of each is competing for the allegiance of the general Iranian public. If
the reformers can convince most Iranians of the justice of their cause, they will swing behind the opposition. If
the hard liners can convince the public that the reformers are nothing more than cat's paws of a grasping,
imperialist West-- i.e. that they are Ahmad Chalabis trying to bring Iran foreign occupation so as to get power
themselves-- then the reformists will be crushed. Iranians value national independence above all, having
suffered with a CIA-installed goverment for decades in the mid-twentieth century.
The prescriptions of John McCain and Faux Cable news for muscular US diplomacy at this point are tone deaf

to Iranian realities and would backfire big time, harming both the reform cause and US interests. Anyway, after
the basket case to which the US Republican Party reduced Iraq, no one in the global South is likely to want
them meddling in their internal affairs.
Reports are streaming in of the arrest of over a hundred opposition figures and of hard line militia men
following protesters home and breaking into their homes to terrorize them. See e.g., Basij paramilitary forces
terrorize residential complex. The Basij militiamen are said to be afraid to come out in numbers during the
opposition demonstrations, but sneak around at night to trail protesters and harass or arrest them.
Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei had met Tuesday morning with the representatives of all four presidential
candidates, urging them to make up but continuing to insist that Alunadinejad was the winner by 24 million to
14 million votes. He portrayed the massive post-election demonstrations and charges of ballot fraud as a minor
tiff.
Gary Sick wonders if Khamenei really is the supreme leader any more, and hints that the hard line tack of
stealing the election was directed by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, the country's religious national
guard.
Reports are coming in from Iran that allege that the regime is tracking down and destroying satellite dishes,
using helicopters for aerial surveillance of neighborhoods and Basij, the right wing militia (sort of like
Mussolini's Black Shirts) to do the breaking and entering. Kindly neighbors who have tried to warn suspected
satellite dish owners that the militiamen were coming have sometimes reportedly themselves been arrested.

Dear Hillary,
Hope you are resting comfortably. Please take this as an excuse to get much needed rest. Lots of
people have expressed best wishes for you to me--Sean Wilentz, Joe Conason, Gene Lyons, etc--so
if they haven't contacted you because you're behind a wall you should know that many, many people
are thinking about you now.
I spoke this morning to Gary Sick, who, you recall, was senior person on NSC during the Iran hostage
crisis, and is now at Columbia. He has one of the best intelligence networks on Iran, 1,500 people,
experts with extensive contacts, and many Iranians, deeply embedded in the unfolding events
Gary tells me that Mousavi has evolved from a mild-mannered
reformer to directly challenging the regime. Nobody, he says, knows where this will go, certainly not
the Iranians. Khamenei has exposed himself and lost his aura of mystification, plunging into the arena
as a political player. Mousavi has issued a new revolutionary manifesto, just translated; I enclose
below Sick's report and analysis on it. This poses, Sick says, a new challenge to Khamenei. Does he
let it stand? Does he answer it? Sick also says US diplomacy in fact can't accomplish anything with
the regime until the crisis completely works its way out, which could take years. He points out that the
first mass demonstrations against the Shah occurred a full year before his overthrow. He adds that
the one thing the regime has learned fro m the Shah is not to be equivocal toward demonstrations.
Two ideas, who knows, but here they are: 1. Though the regime uses Western protests to consolidate
control, some of them contribute to its deep crisis of legitimacy. Sick says Obama's statement, for
example, was good. He also cites a statement from Ban Ki Moon. If there would be a UN action,
shouldn't it focus ont he human rights/violence aspect? A statement and/or resolution urging the
regime to stop illegitimate violence of paramilitary militias? US shouldn't initiate. 2. Establish linkage
in negotiations with Russians on Start between their objections to missile defense outposts in Poland
and Czech Republic (especially if we plan to give them up) with Russian arms sales to Iran.
Get well. See Sick analysis below.

Although he denounces the "lies and fraud" of the leadership, particularly in the recent election, he views the
fraudulent election as only as the symptom of something far more serious. He describes a revolution gone
wrong, a revolution that was originally based on attention to the voice of the peo ple but has resulted in "forcing
an unwanted government on the nation."
It is apparent from this statement that Mousavi's movement—and Mousavi himself—have evolved enormously
in the past week.
This moment is "a turning point," he says, and he defines the movement that is forming around him as having a
"historical mission" to accomplish nothing less than "renewing the life of the nation" according to its own
ideals.
He acknowledges, interestingly, that his own voice at the beginning was less "eloquent" than he would have
wished and that the people were ahead of him in turning the movement green. But now he accepts the "burden
of duty put on our shoulders by the destiny of generations and ages."
He denounces both extremes of the political spectrum: on one hand those who believe that "Islamic government
is the same as Tyranny of the Rightful;" and on the other, those who "consider religion and Islam to be blockers
for realization of republicanism," i.e. those who believe that democracy is incompatible with Islam.
Mousavi says his call for annulment of the election and a revote, supervised by an impartial national body, "is a
given right." The objective is nothing less than "to achieve a new type of political life in the country."
That is truly a revolutionary statement. He says he will stand by the side of all those seeking "new solutions" in
a n on-violent way. He accepts the principles and the institutions of the Islamic Republic, including the
Revolutionary Guard and the basij, but denounces "deviations and deceptions." He demands reform "that
returns us to the pure principles of the Islamic Revolution."
He calls for freedom of expression in all its forms, and says that if the government permits people to express
their views freely, "there won't be a need for the presence of military and regulatory forces in the streets."
It is apparent from this statement that Mousavi's movement—and Mousavi himself—have evolved enormously
in the past week. The candidate started as a mild-mannered reformer. After the searing events of the past several
days, he has dared to preach a counter sermon to Khamene'i's lecture on Islamic government. Although he never
mentions the Leader by name, there is no overlooking the direct contradiction of his arguments. This open
opposition to the Leader by a political figure is unprecedented. •
Mousavi has in fact issued a manifesto for a new vision of the Islamic Republic. The repression and disdain of
the government has brought the opposition to a place they probably never dreamed of going. And no one knows
where any of the parties are likely to go next.
But for outside observers, it is like standing on the edge of a glacier and feeling the ice begin to crack under
your feet.

Executive Summary
Working from the province by province breakdowns of the 2009 and 2005
results, released by the Iranian Ministry of Interior, and from the 2006 census
as published by the official Statistical Centre of Iran, the following observations
about the official data and the debates surrounding it can be made.
•In two conservative provinces, Mazandaran and Yazd, a turnout of
more than 100% was recorded.
•At a provincial level, there is no correlation between the increased
turnout and the swing to Ahmadinejad. This challenges the notion that
Ahmadinejad's victory was due to the massive participation of a
previously silent conservative majority.
•In a third of all provinces, the official results would require that
Ahmadinejad took not only all former conservative voters, all former

centrist voters, and all new voters, but also up to 44% of former
Reformist voters, despite a decade of conflict between these two
groups.
•In 2005, as in 2001 and 1997, conservative candidates, and
Ahmadinejad in particular, were markedly unpopular in rural areas.
That the countryside always votes conservative is a myth. The claim
that this year Ahmadinejad swept the board in more rural provinces
flies in the face of these trends.

1. Irregularities in Voter Turnout
Two provinces show a turnout of over 100% and four more show a turnout of
over 90%. Regional variations in participation have disappeared. There is no
correlation between the increase in participation, and the swing to
Ahm adinejad.
Firstly, across the board there is a massive increase in turnout, with several
provinces increasing their participation rate by nearly 75%. This increase
results in substantially less variation in turnout between provinces, with the
standard deviation amongst provincial turnouts falling by just over 23% since
2005. The 2005 results show a substantial turnout gap, with seven provinces
recording turnout below 60%, and ten above 70%. In 2009, only two were
below 70% and 24 were above 80%. In fact, 21 out of 30 provinces had
turnouts within 5% of 83%. The data seems to suggest that regional variations
in participation have suddenly disappeared.
This makes the evident lack of any sort of correlation between the provinces
that saw an increase in turnout and those that saw a swing to Ahmadinejad
(Fig.1) all the more unusual. There is no significant correlation between the
increase in participation for a given province and the swing to Ahmadinejad
(Fig.1). This lack of correlation makes the argument that an increase in
participation by a previously silent conservative majority won the election for
Ahmadinejad somewhat problematic.
Furthermore, there are concerns about the numbers themselves. Two
provinces, Mazandaran and Yazd, have results which indicate that more votes
were cast on 12 June than there were eligible voters and that four more
provinces had turnouts in the mid-nineties.
In a country where allegations of 'tombstone voting' — the practice200f using the
identity documents of the deceased to cast additional ballots — are both longstanding
and widespread, this result is troubling but perhaps not unexpected.
This problem did not start with Ahmadinejad; according to official statistics
gathered by the International institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance
in Stockholm, there were 12.9% more registered voters at the time of
Mohammed Khatami's 2001 victory than there were citizens of voting age.
In conclusion, a number of aspects of the reported turnout figures are
problematic. The massive increases from 2005, the collapse of regional
variations, and the absence of any clear correlation between increases in
turnout and increased support for any candidate on their own make the results
problematic.

2. Where did Ahmadinejad's New Votes Come From?
According to the official Ministry of Interior voting data (see Appendix),
Mahmud Ahmadinejad has increased the conservative vote by 113%
compared to the 2005 election. There is little correlation in provincial level
results between the increase in turnout and the swing to the President,
challenging the notion that a previously silent conservative majority has come
out to support him. Interestingly, in 1.0 out of 30 provinces, mainly former
Mehdi Karrubi strongholds, the official data suggests that Ahmadinejad
received not only the votes of all former non-voters and former Rafsanjani
voters, but also took up to 44% of the vote from those who had previously
voted Reformist.
According to the official data1, Mahmud Ahmadinejad has received
approximately 13m more votes in this election than the combined conservative
vote in the 2005 Presidential election2.
Assuming that Ahmadinejad retained all 11.5m Conservative votes from 2005,
these additional 13m votes could have come from three sources, in
descending order of likelihood:
•The approximately 10.6m citizens who did not vote in 2005, but chose
to vote in this election
•The 6.2m citizens who voted for the centrist Rafsanjani in 2005
•The 10.4m citizens who voted for Reformist candidates in 2005
In order to examine in detail where Ahmadinejad's increased support came
from, the table below (Fig.3) shows the composition of the 2009 vote by
province, dividing it into those who voted Conservative, Rafsanjani, and
Reformist in 2005, and those who did not vote at all in 2005. It assumes that
2005 voters will vote again.
The table demonstrates that in the 10 of Iran's 30 provinces highlighted red, in
order for the official statistics to be correct Ahmadinejad would have needed to
win over all new voters, all former Rafsanjani voters, and also up to 44% of
former reformist voters.
1 Serious complaints have been raised about both the 2005 elections and the 2009
elections. Government data is not perfectly reliable.
2 In 2005 there were three Conservative candidates in the first round. Ahmadinejad can
reasonably be expected to have received in 2009, all votes cast for Conservatives in
2005. Here, Ahmadinejad's 2009 performance is compared to the combined
performance of all three Conservatives in 2005.
Preliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Iran's 2009 Presidential Election
www.chathamhouse.org.uk 6
It is notable that many of these are provinces where the Reformist cleric Mehdi
Karrubi polled highly in 2005, and the government's figures would appear to
suggest that his former supporters have not voted tactically for the likely
Reformist challenger Mir Hussein Musavi, as many had expected, but rather
that they have defected to the hard-line conservative incumbent Ahmadinejad.
This interpretation is to some extent supported by the relationship between the
percentage of former Karrubi voters in a province, and its swing to
Ahmadinejad (Fig.2).
To many Reformists, this situation is extremely unlikely. Mehdi Karrubi is a
well-known reformist, of polar opposite views to Ahmadinejad on issues of
political and cultural freedoms, economic management, and foreign policy.
They allege fraud, and it is likely that the provinces where Karrubi's vote has
collapsed will provide the bulk of the 600+ complaints which the defeated
c andidates are lodging against the conduct of the election.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762461 Date: 06/30/2015
However, Karrubi, like Ahmadinejad, is seen as a 'man of the people', and
Ahmadinejad is as much a re-incarnation of the Islamic Republic's early hard
left as he is a leader of its current hard-right. Ahmadinejad's supporters thus
claim that rural voters voted for Ahmadinejad in 2009 for precisely the same
reasons that they voted for Karrubi in 2005.
The data offers no arbitration in this dispute, although Roukema's application
of statistical fraud detection techniques to the 'by district' data has turned up
some anomalies with respect to the figures for Karrubi's vote,3 which may
suggest that they were created by a computer. These can be followed up
should the fully disaggregated 'by polling station' data be released during the
ongoing dispute.

3. Do Rural Voters Support Ahmadinejad?
Many commentators have suggested, before and after the Presidential
Election, that Ahmadinejad is very popular in rural areas and that this explains
his high levels of support. However, the data from the 2005 Presidential
election does not support this contention. Instead, it confirms that what
support Ahmadinejad did gain in 2005 was mainly from urban and suburban
areas. The graphs below show the levels of support for Ahmadinejad against
the rural population of the province in question (Fig.4) and Conservatives as a
group (Fig.5).

This data supports the con tention of academic experts on rural Iranian politics4
that rural voters have not been the dedicated Ahmadinejad supporters
occasionally described in western media. This is supported by the fact that
much of Iran's rural population is comprised of ethnic minorities: Lors, Baluch,
•
Kurdish, and Arab amongst others. These ethnic minorities have a history both
of voting Reformist and of voting for members of their own ethnic group. For

example, they were an important segment of Khatami's vote in 1997 and 2001
and voted largely for Karrubi and Mostafa Moin in 2005.
The 2009 data suggests a sudden shift in political support with precisely these
rural provinces, which had not previously supported Ahmadinejad or any other
conservative (Fig.5) showing substantial swings to Ahmadinejad (Fig.6). At the
same time, the official data suggests that the vote for Mehdi Karrubi, who was
extremely popular in these rural, ethnic minority areas in 2005, has collapsed
entirely even in his home province of Lorestan, where his vote has gone from
440,247 (55.5%) in 2005 to just 44,036 (4.6%) in 2009. This is paralleled by
an overall swing of 50.9% to Ahmadinejad, with official results suggesting that
he has captured the support of 47.5% of those who cast their ballots for

Reformist candidates in 2005. This, more than any other result, is highly
implausible, and has been the subject of much debate in Iran.
This increase in support for Ahmadinejad amongst rural and ethnic minoritiy
voters is out of step with previous trends, extremely large in scale, and central
to the question of why (or indeed whether) he won in June 2009.

Release Detail
July 7, 2009 - Obama's Approval Drops In Ohio - Critical Swing State, Quinnipiac University Poll Finds;
2010 Senate Race Tips Slightly To Democrats
Word format
President Barack Obama gets a lackluster 49 - 44 percent approval rating in Ohio, considered by many to be the
most important swing state in a presidential election, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released today.
This is President Obama's lowest approval rating in any national or statewide Quinnipiac University poll since
he was inaugurated and is down from 62 - 31 percent in a May 6 survey.
By a small 48 - 46 percen t margin, voters disapprove of the way Obama is handling the economy, the
independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University poll finds. This is down from a 57 - 36 percent approval
May 6. A total of 66 percent of Ohio voters are "somewhat dissatisfied" or "very dissatisfied" with the way
things are going in the state, while 33 percent are "very satisfied" or "somewhat satisfied," numbers that haven't
changed since Obama was elected.
In the race for Ohio's U.S. Senate seat being vacated by retiring George Voinovich in 2010, Lee Fisher and
Jennifer Brunner remain neck-and-neck for the Democratic nomination and both would defeat any of the GOP
candidates if the election were today.
"The economy in Ohio is as bad as anywhere in America. These numbers indicate that for the first time voters
have decided that President Barack Obama bears some responsibility for their problems," said Peter A. Brown,
assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.
"Until now voters have given President Obama high ratings on the economy, blaming former President George
W. Bush for their problems. They might be taking out their frustration on President Obama, possibly deciding
that the change he promised has not come as quickly as they expected."
"Ohio historically has been the prototypical swing state. One of the reasons Barack Obama won the p residency
by such a wide margin is that he carried Ohio with 52 percent of the vote and captured the lion's share of
independent votes," Brown added.

"Now, by a 48 - 46 percent margin, Ohio independent voters give the President a failing grade on the economy.
These numbers indicate that he may be losing, at least for now, some of those who voted for him in November
and should be an indication to the White House that his honeymoon with the voters may be ending."
In the Senate race, Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher holds a 24 - 21 percent lead over Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner in
the race for the Democratic nomination, with 51 percent undecided.
Former U.S. Rep. Rob Portman holds a 33 - 10 percent lead over car dealer Tom Ganley on the Republican
side, with 55 percent undecided.
In general election trial heats, Brunner would defeat Ganley 35 - 31 percent and get 35 percent to Portman's 34
percent. Fisher leads Ganley 36 - 30 percent and Portman 37 - 33 percent.
From June 26 - July 1, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,259 Ohio voters, with a margin of error of +/- 2.8
percentage points. The survey includes 483 Democrats with a margin of error of +/- 4.5 percentage points and
445 Republicans with a margin of error of +/-4.7 percentage points.
The Quinnipiac University Poll, directed by Douglas Schwartz, Ph.D., conducts public opinion surveys in
Florida, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Ohio and the nation as a public service and for
research. For more data and RSS feed - http://www.quinnipiac.edu/polling.xml, or (203) 582-5201.

Re: Your CFR speech
The draft, sent by separate email, is intended to give you options and ideas. Use as you wish. Several ideas
are at the core of this version: in particular, the concept of the US as a modern global nation and how
that serves our capacity for leadership.
For most policy speeches a generic tone and workmanlike prose are acceptable. But for this one, it is not.
This speech can't afford to be lackluster. It will then be held up in invidious comparison to Obama's
glittering best efforts. Your speech must have, amid the policies, a distinctive and authoritative voice.
Your early draft makes no distinctions between allies or partners; indeed, it barely mentions allies. The early
draft also features a strong malaise theme. Even if rebutted after being raised, the focus is on obstacles
and hindrances, not on achievements, opportunities and what can be achieved. There's no accounting of
progress so far. The effect is downbeat in tone. At the same time, the draft contains passages of vague
and gauzy liberal universalism, while in one line assailing it, an unconvincing juggling act. The notion
that all nations and peoples want the same things as Americans will not fly and is open to derision. It
reflects blithe liberal cultural imperialism, among other things. (See Graham Greene. And, on the
contrary, some nations—and peoples—seek nuclear weapons, like Iran; some don't want to curb global
warming, like China; some don't care about human rights, like most Arab nations; some have contempt
for democracy, including de facto allies like Egypt, not to mention Myanmar; and some are indifferent
to poverty, any number of African kleptocracies.) Also there is some confusion of definitions, for
example, asserting dialogue with adversaries is "strategic engagement," when that is a concept usually
applied to allies and partners.
The speech must be crafted with a sense of real time and cannot be delivered out of sync with it. Slogans
can become shopworn, especially those that lack analytical, historical and descriptive power. What
served you once, at your confirmation, may not serve again in the same way. The most cogent foreign
policy columnists from Clive Crook of the Financial Times to David Rothkopf of Foreign Policy have
already written columns in the last week on the limits of "soft power" (i.e., "smart power") and others I
understand are preparing to make similar criticisms. I would use sparingly or not at all. You do not need

Can National Security Adviser James Jones Survive
a Second Round of Attacks and "Longer Knives"?
I am here in London where I'm participating in an interesting forum sponsored by the Princeton Project on
National Security and the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) Transatlantic Program, I've received not just
one email -- but three -- from prominent insider journalists and policy hands that Jim Jones' tenure as National
Security Adviser is highly fragile.
One of these emails reports starkly:
Knives getting longer
That's all my contact said. But other emails have intimated to me a serious tone-deafness by Jones about his role
and responsibilities, his relationship with the President, and his relationship with younger, dedicated,
hardworking and late-working staff. Jones recently said that National Security Council staff members that
stayed longer than 7:30 pm must be disorganized in their work.
I speak to various NSC officials -- often at 10:00 or 11:00 pm at night. They are hardworking, racing as fast as
they can to manage the many, many, many major initiatives that Barack Obama has decided to simultaneously
pursue.
James Jones is considered by his admirers to be a genius when thinking about management structures and
decision-making processes. On the other hand, his critics see him as a plodding, slow-moving, out of touch
retired general who was better prepared to think about the last era rather than the one we are moving into. His
°critics think that he's just too unable to animate nimble, high flex policy decision making products for a White
House on a manic dash to get a lot of top tier issues dealt with.
Friends at the National Security Council respect a great deal the way in which NSC Deputy Tom Donilon is
managing his brief Many see him picking up the load that Jones seems unable or unwilling to carry. Donilon is
deeply engaged in the broad Middle East and Iran portfolio, the non-proliferation/WMD/arms control portfolio,
the China economic and security portfolio, and he has -- according to reports -- supported and helped cultivate
relationship building between State, DoD, the NSC, and other parts of the national security bureaucracy.
Some tell me that James Jones decided to try and remove himself from the "whack-a-mole" crisis reaction style
of decision-making that could rob the Obama administration of the chance to define a new course in national

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762707 Date: 06/30/2015
security affairs. Tom Donilon, according to reports, wields far more the hand of power when it comes to day to
day management and responding to crises that require presidential attention and response.
Jones, in contrast, has been obsessed with the structure of decisions -- who is involved in those decisions, what
the structure of decision-making should be, and what legal modifications to this process need to be made. He
looks at that as the big nut that needs to be cracked -- and that would improve, according to Jim Jones, the
President's effectiveness and chances of success at a macro level.
Jones' self-determined task is not high profile, mostly structural, and has not won him many admirers for
leadership -- but what he is doing is necessary. If he departs his role, this challenge of dealing with the growing
complexity of national security threats and the vital need to recalibrate the policy making and decision-making
process will require the attention of someone serious.
So, whether Jones stays or goes -- his portfolio will remain vital.
But what is clear is that Jones has enemies and that they are trying to undermine his place in the Obama orbit.
Their motives may not be earnest concern about the tempo or pace of Jones' management style -- but they very
well could be his unwillingness to allow the liberal interventionists inside the Obama administration to have
more than their fair share of power in the Obama decision-making process.
Jones has structured an all views on the table approach to decision making -- quite evident when it comes to
Middle East policy -- and the hawkish/neocon-friendly/Likudist-hugging part of the Obama administration's
foreign policy operation may be engaged in a coup attempt against Jones.
I don't know if he'll survive this latest effort to oust him -- but folks need to know that those "longer knives", on
the whole, do not have pure motives.

Re: Your CFR speech
1. This draft, sent by separate email, is intended to give you options and ideas. Use as you
wish. Several ideas are at the core of this version: in particular, the concept of the US as a
modern global nation and how that serves our capacity for leadership.
2. For most policy speeches a generic tone and workmanlike prose are acceptable. But for
this one, it is not. This speech can't afford to be lackluster. It will then be held up in
invidious comparison to Obama's glittering best efforts. Your speech must have, amid the
policies, a distinctive and authoritative voice.
3. Your early draft makes no distinctions between allies or partners; indeed, it barely
mentions allies. The early draft also features a strong malaise theme. Even if rebutted
after being raised, the focus is on obstacles and hindrances, not on achievements,
opportunities and what can be achieved. There's no accounting of progress so far. The
effect is downbeat in tone. At the same time, the draft contains passages of vague and
gauzy liberal universalism, while in one line assailing it, an unconvincing juggling act.
The notion that all nations and peoples want the same things as Americans will not fly
and is open to derision. It reflects blithe liberal cultural imperialism, among other things.
(See Graham Greene. And, on the contrary, some nations—and peoples—seek nuclear
weapons, like Iran; some don't want to curb global warming, like China; some don't care
about human rights, like most Arab nations; some have contempt for democracy,
including de facto allies like Egypt, not to mention Myanmar; and some are indifferent to
poverty, any number of African kleptocracies.) Also there is some confusion of
definitions, for example, asserting dialogue with adversaries is "strategic engagement,"
when that is a concept usually applied to allies and partners.

The problem when the president is the policy...

You could tell it wasn't going well. The conversations with Medvedev and Putin were tense, the body language
awkward. The speech at the New Economic School laid an egg. The press seemed bored with the visit of
America's rock star president. And as for real results, well, there weren't any.
Looking for explanations in an article Clifford Levy and Ellen Barry in today's New York Times called "In
Russia, Obama's Star Power Does Not Translate," a range of possible answers were rolled out: Russians are
jaded, Russians don't go for U.S. political posturing, Obama's speeches don't translate well, and, according to
one person who ought to understand politics, a Russian circus designer, "Russians are the smartest people in the

world." (A fact they have carefully hidden behind a veil of hundreds of years of economic and political
catastrophe.)
Somehow, the formula that has been working for Barack Obama since early in 2007 suddenly seems to have
gone cold. It is not enough simply to be him or to roll out Michelle and the girls (all of whom joined him in
Moscow...unlike say, his top two State Department officials). What's more, it's not just Russia. Oh sure, the
press still swoon in most corners of the world and crowds and political leaders still get all fluttery when first
exposed to America's charming, thoughtful, intelligent, young president. But we are now starting to see what
happens when being Barack Obama is not enough. We are now starting to see the shortcomings of the new
administration's approach wherein the president has actually been the policy.
He has said we had changed and offered himself as evidence. He has been what we have offered to friends in
terms of visits, access and calls. He has been the headline grabber, the spokesperson, the new voice of America.
He has enabled the administration to take inherited policies and wrap them in Obama-paper with Obama-glitter
all over it and all of a sudden, the old was repackaged into appearing new. Where there have been differences,
as with the concept of engagement, the change has been sold as a difference between him and his predecessor,
with his speeches describing what was new and the possibility of interacting with him being the potential pay-
off.
This played big during his early trips overseas, the novelty value was high and the eagerness to move on from
the painful prior era was great. At the G20 meeting, at the Summit of the Americas, in Cairo, the concept of
"president as policy" seemed to be working. But now we see where it is not. Not in Russia. Not with the
Iranians who are happy to accept engagement and anything else that will be given to them but no strings, please
Not with Hugo Chavez, who hammed it up with Obama in Trinidad but led his misfit chorus in reflexively
hammering the United States after the coup in Honduras. Certainly not in North Korea.
It seems that having the president as policy works best with the people who are pre-disposed to like us and to
some extent with the young and the disenfranchised. But with the hard cases, with our enemies, it falls painfully
and dangerously flat.
In these instances, the new president is discovering that something much more than personal diplomacy and
smile from the genuinely appealing Obama clan is needed. In these instances, we are going to need to go back
to the drawing board and do the grunt work of foreign policy, the tough negotiations, the nuanced position
changes, the threats, the cajoling. It's a very different game from American politics and, in fact, is often
completely unconnected to it. What works here, very often does not play at all overseas.
There is a problem with this new reality. It requires a coordinated, multi-tiered, high-functioning foreign policy
establishment. It needs the State Department to be in a central role. It needs the NSC to work both as a policy
development and policy implementation mechanism and the National Security Advisor to be seen and
respected.. .like the Secretary of State.. .as key advisors. It requires that the foreign policy of the United States is
not centered too heavily either the president or the executive office of the president -- although the president
will always remain the ultimate key. It is perfectly appropriate for the president to be part of the product, part
of the rewards offered, and the mastermind...but he needs to move beyond campaign mode to something new. It
is much akin to the entrepreneur of a successful company recognizing that for the company to grow further, to
become a mature organization, he is going to need a mature structure that depends less on him and more on
delegation of power to effective lieutenants and their teams.
We're not there yet. The secretary of state and the State Department have been visibly marginalized. She has
become a kind of behind the scenes player. She's not on the Sunday morning shows. The president or the vice
president handles the big media assignments (often not sounding exactly like they were on the same page). The
National Security Advisor, for all his personal strengths, is viewed as a bit of a lost cause five months into the
presidency. One of his predecessors in the job said to me when asked whether he viewed General Jones as
failing in the job, "to me, on that issue, where there is smoke, there is fire." Tom Donilon, Jones's deputy, is
seen to be managing the NSC process. Denis McDonough and Mark Lippert, Obama confidantes, are seen to be
working closely with him and his inner office team (Rahm Emanuel, the VP, David Axelrod, Greg Craig and
others) to play the leading role in shaping policy.
Clearly neither Hillary Clinton nor Jim Jones is a weak person. But all power in the U.S. national security
apparatus flows from the president. And there is no denying that, despite the fact that they show up at work

every day and go through the motions, that their roles don't measure up to many of their predecessors and the
structure that is emerging suggests problems to come.
It's time to move out of campaign mode and into governing mode. It's time recognize that it really does take a
big team of empowered leaders to make the complex foreign policy of the U.S. work and evolve in the right
directions. It's time to recognize that it does not reflect badly on the president if we all agree he cannot
transform the world single handedly, that however different he may be from his predecessors, that alone is not
enough.

Re: any truth to this account? Sid
The writer was not only a correspondent for The Guardian there but also apparently was on the Maldives delegation
putting him in various rooms. The accounts from the conference have been very fragmentary, the administration has
explained very little (for whatever reasons and to its detriment), and it is being widely blamed internationally. The broader
lesson I draw from Chinese disrespect for the president (and US) on his trip (I've heard accounts from journalists), its
behavior at Copenhagen, mercantalist economic policy (eg, currency), and its rough use of and contempt for international
organizations, not to mention the strange form of Chinese neo-colonialism in Africa, is the need for policy review. Fear of
Chinese retribution (economy. Iran, etc) can't be allowed to paralyze reassessment, though it should be factored into
scenarios. The Europeans are being damaged worse by Chinese economic policy than us and China policy is a new area
for the Western alliance to consult on. Leaving it to Treasury apparently parks policy in a laissez faire twilight zone.
Treasury has been as effective on China as it has been on AIG. Just thoughts of an observer.

How do I know China wrecked the Copenhagen deal? I was in the room
As recriminations fly post-Copenhagen, one writer offers a fly-on-the-wall
account of how talks failed
Mark Lynas <http://www.:_guardin.co ik/Tor narklynas>
guardian.co.uk <http://www.guardian .co.uk> , Tuesday 22 December 2009
19.54 GMT
Copenhagen was a disaster. That much is agreed. But the truth about what
actually happened is in danger of being lost amid the spin and inevitable mutual
recriminations. The truth is this: China <http.//www.gua,dj.an.cc.uk/world/china>
wrecked the talks, intentionally humiliated Barack Obama, and insisted on an
awful "deal" so western leaders would walk away carrying the blame. How do I
know this? Because I was in the room and saw it happen.
China's strategy was simple: block the open negotiations for two weeks, and then
ensure that the closed-door deal made it lock as if the west had failed the
world's poor once again. And sure enough, the aid agencies, civil society
movements and environmental groups all took the bait. The failure was "the
inevitable result of rich countries refusing adequately and fairly to shoulder
their overwhelming responsibility", said Christian Aid. "Rich countries have
bullied developing nations," fumed Friends of the Earth International.
All very predictable, but the complete opposite of the truth. Even George
Monbiot, writing in yesterday's Guardian, made the mistake of singly blaming
.Obama. But I saw Obama fighting desperately to salvage a deal, and the Chinese
delegate saying "no", over and over again. Monbiot even approvingly quoted the
Sudanese delegate Lumumba Di-Aping, who denounced the Copenhagen accord as "a
suicide pact, an incineration pact, in order to maintain the economic dominance
of a few countries".

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762863 Date: 06/30/2015
Sudan behaves at the talks as a puppet of China; one of a number of countries
that relieves the Chinese delegation of having to fight its battles in open
sessions. It was a perfect stitch-up. China gutted the deal behind the scenes,
and then left its proxies to savage it in public.
Here's what actually went on late last Friday night, as heads of state from two
dozen countries met behind closed doors. Obama was at the table for several
hours, sitting between Gordon Brown and the Ethiopian prime minister, Meles
Zenawi. The Danish prime minister chaired, and on his right sat Ban Ki-moon,
secretary-general of the UN. Probably only about 50 or 60 people, including the
heads of state, were in the room. I was attached to one of the delegations,
whose head of state was also present for most of the time.
What I saw was profoundly shocking. The Chinese premier, Wen Jinbao, did not
deign to attend the meetings personally, instead sending a second-tier official
in the country's foreign ministry to sit opposite Obama himself. The diplomatic
snub was obvious and brutal, as was the practical implication: several times
during the session, the world's most powerful heads of state were forced to wait
around as the Chinese delegate went off to make telephone calls to his
"superiors".
Shifting the blame
To those who would blame Obama and rich countries in general, know this: it was
China's representative who insisted that industrialised country targets,
previously agreed as an 80% cut by 2050, be taken out of the deal. "Why can't we
even mention our own targets?" demanded a furious Angela Merkel. Australia's
prime minister, Kevin Rudd, was annoyed enough to bang his microphone. Brazil's
representative too pointed out the illouicality of China's position. Why should
rich countries not announce even this unilateral cut? The Chinese delegate said
no, and I watched, aghast, as Merkel threw up her hands in despair and conceded
the point. Now we know why - because China bet, correctly, that Obama would get
the blame for the Copenhagen accord's lack of ambition.
China, backed at times by India, then proceeded to take out all the numbers that
mattered. A 2020 peaking year in global emissions, essential to restrain

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762863 Date: 06/30/2015
temperatures to 2C, was removed and replaced by woolly language suggesting that
emissions should peak "as soon as possible". The long-term target, of global 50%
cuts by 2050, was also excised. No one else, perhaps with the exceptions of
India and Saudi Arabia, wanted this to happen. I am certain that had the Chinese
not been in the room, we would have left Copenhagen with a deal that had
environmentalists popping champagne corks popping in every corner of the world.
Strong position
So how did China manage to pull off this coup? First, it was in an extremely
strong negotiating position. China didn't heed a deal. As one developing country
foreign minister said to me: "The Athenians had nothing to offer to the
Spartans." On the other hand, western leaders in particular - but also
presidents Lula of Brazil, Zuma of South Africa, Calderon of Mexico and many
others - were desperate for a positive outcome. Obama needed a strong deal
perhaps more than anyone. The US had confirmed the offer of $100bn to developing
countries for adaptation, put serious cuts on the table for the first time (17%
below 2005.1evels by 2020), and was obviously prepared. to up its offer.
Above all, Obama needed to be able to demonstrate to the Senate that he could
deliver China in any global climate regulation framework, so conservative
senators could not argue that US carbon cuts would further advantage Chinese
industry. With midterm elections looming, Obama and his staff also knew that
Copenhagen would be probably their only opportunity to go to climate change
<http: fwww.guardian.co.uk/envirohment/climate change> talks with a strong
mandate. This further strengthened China's negotiating hand, as did the complete
lack of civil society political pressure on either China or India. Campaign
groups never blame developing countries for failure; this is an iron rule that
is never broken. The Indians, in particular, have become past masters at
co-opting the language of equity ("equal rights to the atmosphere") in the
service of planetary suicide - and leftish campaigners and commentators are
hoist with their own petard.
With the deal gutted, the heads of state session concluded with a final battle
as the Chinese delegate insisted on removing the 1.5C target so beloved of the

small island states and low-lying nations who have most to lose from rising
seas. President Nasheed of the Maldives, supported by Brown, fought valiantly to
save this crucial number. "How can you ask my country to go extinct?" demanded
Nasheed. The Chinese delegate feigned great offence - and the number stayed, but
surrounded by language which makes it all but meaningless. The deed was done.
China's game
All this raises the question: what is China's game? Why- did China, in the words
of a UK-based analyst who also spent hours in heads of state meetings, "not only
reject targets for itself, but also refuse to allow any other country to take on
binding targets?" The analyst, who has attended climate conferences for more
than 15 years, concludes that China wants to weaken the climate regulation
regime now "in order to avoid the risk that it might be called on to be more
ambitious in a few years' time".
This does not mean China is not serious about global warming. It is strong in
both the wind and solar industries. But China's growth, and growing global
political and economic dominance, is based largely on cheap. coal. China knows it
is becoming an uncontested superpower; indeed its newfound muscular confidence
was on striking display in Copenhagen_ Its coal-based economy doubles every
decade, and its power increases commensurately. Its leadership will not alter
this magic formula unless they absolutely have to.
Copenhagen was much worse than just another bad deal, because it illustrated a
profound shift in global geopolitics. This is fast becoming China's century, yet
its leadership has displayed that multilateral environmental governance is not
only not a priority, but is viewed as a hindrance to the new superpower's
freedom of action. I left Copenhagen more despondent than I have felt in a long
time. After all the hope and. all the hype, the mobilisation of thousands, a wave
of optimism crashed against the rock of global power politics, fell back, and
drained away.

The Guardian
David Miliband: Labour is facing the fight of its life
Foreign secretary thought about quitting the government in last week's turmoil

Voters still don't know what Labour and Gordon Brown stand for, David Miliband admits today, as he reveals
how close he came to quitting the government during last week's turmoil at Westminster.
Speaking to the Guardian at the end of 10 extraordinary days, the foreign secretary says the party's high
command was given an "electric shock" by the disastrous European election results, and he urges fellow
ministers to get out and prepare for "the fight of our life".
But Miliband also concedes that he considered following his close friend and ally James Purnell, who resigned
from the government last week and called for the prime minister to stand down.
Miliband said: "I'd made my decision on Thursday. Sometimes you can make your decisions with great
planning and calculation and sometimes you have to make them rather more quickly. James made his decision
in good faith, I made my decision in good faith ... we all have tolive with our decisions."
The Labour party has a settled view of who should be leader, he said. "This divides people who are close and
people feel passionately one way and people feel passionately the other way."
Describing the task now facing Labour, he says: "It could not be more urgent that there is a maximum of 11
months until the next general election, that we got 15% of the vote nationally [last week], that we came second
in Wales and that one in 20 people voted for us. If that does not electric shock us out of our ministerial chairs to
think: 'By God, we have got the fight of our life on our hands because whatever the Tories are they certainly
don't deserve a landslide' — then nothing will."
Miliband has not given a domestic policy interview for nearly nine months since he felt dogged by accusations
that he was manoeuvring for the premiership. He refuses to acknowledge that his decision to back Brown last
week saved the prime minister, saying "it is impossible to tell".
But the foreign secretary feels his loyalty has given him the freedom to speak his mind without his motives
being questioned by anyone in Downing Street.
Miliband betrays frustration at the absence of a clear Labour vision, saying: "We need the message to go out
that we have got the humility to learn about what has gone wrong.
"It is not a masochism strategy. It is about saying what we believe in. It is about clarity, priority, adding up to
purpose. I know what we stand for, I know what our instincts are, but the voters don't. Actually, I know what
Gordon Brown stands for.
"We have a responsibility to make sure that, come the election, [voters] know what Labour stands for. We were
not being listened to, people felt that they had been forgotten, we neither inspired nor reassured."
He calls for cabinet colleagues to show stronger leadership in the battle to restore Labour's fortunes. "We need
to make sure the talents and energies of not just the whole of the cabinet, but the whole of the labour movement
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05763001 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05763001 Date: 06/30/2015
are give n free rein because one in 20 people voted for us. The truth is that we are not automatons. We all have
to get out there."
Asked whether he felt voters had stopped listening to Brown, Miliband said: "He himself has said he has to
build on his strengths and work on his weaknesses. That is a good maxim for all of us. He is someone who
made the right decisions on the biggest issue of the day. We have got a chance to fight with honour and dignity
for what we believe in. The stakes are very high because we know that parties can slump into very dangerous
positions."
Providing what he describes as a route map from the disaster, he said: "Labour first needs a period of
competent, effective, stable government; secondly, we need to reset our political compass so ministers are no
longer locked in their departments, but link their policies to their values; and thirdly, the government has to be
at the cutting edge of policy."
On the issue of political reform, he demands a speeding-up of the pace of political reform, saying it is not a
piece of middle-class frippery. For the first time, he reveals that he now backs the Alternative Vote for the
Commons, saying MPs' legitimacy will be strengthened by being able to say 50% in my constituency voted for
me.
He says the change cannot be made before the general election. He also backs a fresh push on Lords reform,
saying "we have got an agreed blueprint".
He rounded on Tory spending plans, but said Labour would clarify its own intentions before the election. "They
will be credible and clear. We will come to that in an open and honest way."
But he defends delay in setting out these figures, arguing "when you are in the middle of a Tornado it is a bad
time take a forecast".
In an oblique reference to the Damian McBride briefings, he also calls on the media to abandon unattributable
briefings, saying all politicians' spokesmen should be named, or not quoted by media outlets. "The gotcha
culture of politics is not in anyone's interests," he said.

be helpful. This piece of information may be useful if charges are made that he is somehow a spy. besides
writing a book about the former president, is Shane Bauer, one of
the hostages, is a young photojournalist who is a Nation Institute grantee. He is an Arabic speaker who has a grant to
write on Middle East issues. He has written not only for The Nation but also for Christian Science Monitor, San Francisco
Chronicle, and most importantly, the Al Jazeera English speaking website. According to he lives in the region
most of the time, was traveling with his girlfriend in Kurdistan, has an interest in Kurdish affairs, was on a hiking trip, and
obviously and inadvertently crossed an unmarked border. He was not acting as a journalist at the time, though he is a
journalist--and a left-wing kid.

Subject: Peter Galbraith called, wants to talk to you...
Hillary: Peter Galbraith just called me and I had a long talk with him. As you know, as chief of US
mission to UN in Afghanistan he has protested the election fraud and come into conflict with the head
of UN there, who wanted to cover it up. Peter has just come out of Afghanistan after four solid months
there. He is pessimistic, says the analogy to Vietnam is not wrong-headed, that comparisons of
increasing troop levels there as though the surge in Iraq could be replicated are misguided, but thinks
there is an approach that should be attempted that involves the vote recount and trying to replace
Karzai. He wishes to speak with you directly. He says that he has difficulty communicating with
Holbrooke, not because he can't reach him, but because he finds Dick disjointed these days. Peter is
on a plane right now to Norway, then London, then to NY on Wed, then could go to DC. He says you
can reach him through the US mission to the UN office. FYI, from Wash Post today:
"The issue of how seriously to take the fraud charges, and whether to force a runoff, has also caused a rare
public rift within the international community here. The senior American official at the U.N. mission, Peter W.
Galbraith, left the country abruptly Sunday in a dispute with the mission director, Norwegian Kai Eide.
"Galbraith had pushed for an exhaustive probe. Sources who are familiar with the dispute but are not authorized
to. speak on the record said Eide argued that the international community should not press too hard because it
could undermine national stability.
Galbraith had been convinced that Karzai could not win without fraud and had tried to reduce the number of
polling stations in some areas in the south, the incumbent's ethnic stronghold, said one diplomatic source. Eide
and others, the source said, were convinced that Karzai would win in any case and that any irregularities could
be smoothed over, as they were in the 2004 presidential election that Karzai won by a safe margin."

About twenty years ago, I read an article about a death row inmate who had shot a clerk in a convenience store.
The way the murder was presented by the man on death row was mysterious--his hand just rose up and the gun
went off. Shooting the clerk in the face in the midst of a robbery wasn't in fact his fault. He never said, "I shot a
man." It just happened.
I thought of that man while reading Max Blumenthal's terrific, but also, of course, appalling new book,
Republican Gomorrah. Apparently there isn't a single person in the present incarnation of the Republican party
who does anything. Things happen--God does it. Satan does it. No Republican is an agent of his or her own
success or failure, sin or redemption. It just happens.
The consequences of this lack of responsibility are there for all to see--screaming threats, guns at rallies,
unhinged behavior every time a Republican doesn't feel the way he or she wants to feel, absolute sense of
powerlessness leading directly to an absolute will to power. Because that was the thing that struck me about the
murderer in the 7-11--he had the power and in his own last moments, the clerk knew it. But the killer, no matter
how well armed, never felt it.
Republican Gomorrah is a frightening book because it is clear to all of us on the outside that the various
Republican operatives who surround James Dobson and his ilk have no consciences and will stop at nothing.
They invoke the name of God for purposes that shame God absolutely--hurting, destroying, maiming, and
damning others who either don't accept their beliefs or don't acknowledge their power and righteousness. Of
course that is frightening.
But Blumenthal's cast of characters, beginning with Dobson and his prodigal son, Ryan, and including John
Hagee, Sarah Palin, Ralph Reed, Charles Colson, Judith Reisman, Christina Regnery, Donald Wildmon, et al.
strike the reader as above all else very small--egocentric, narrow minded, uneducated, selfish, and resentful.
Each of these qualities is destructive in and of itself The combination is turning out to be coercive. Even those
of us who are immune to the emotions these people play upon are getting more and more nervous about the
power that they wish to exert.
Blumenthal does two things that no one else I have read manages to do--the first of these is that he organizes the
network. He shows how Ted Bundy is connected to James Dobson is connected to Gary Bauer is connected to
Erik Prince is connected to Ralph Reed is connected to Jack Abramoff is connected to Tom Delay is connected
to Tony Perkins is connected to David Duke is connected to Mel Gibson, and so forth, and in the course of
tracing these connections, he informs us, or reminds us, of the crimes and misdemeanors these people have
committed.
Two of my favorites are James Dobson's son Ryan's messy divorce (Dad seems to have paid the settlement--did
he not dare to discipline? Or did he discipline too much?) and David Vitter's habitual recourse to a brothel in
New Orleans where Republicans "wanted to be spanked and tortured and wear stockings--Republicans have
impeccable taste in silk stockings" (the madam is talking about men). Republican Gomorrah is full of crimes--
both those we've already heard of, such as Abramoffs and Ted Haggard's, and those we haven't (there is good
evidence that Texas billionaire T. Cullen Davis, funder of the right wing Council For National Policy, ordered
hits on his estranged wife, and succeeded in murdering his step-daughter and the wife's boyfriend).
This aspect of the book reminds me of a Scottish novel called The Private Memoirs And Confessions Of A
Justified Sinner by James Hogg, in which, once a man believes he is among the saved, he can commit any sin he
wants to and be sure he will go to heaven. Once Davis was "saved," for example, he said, "My goal is to get to
heaven. I'll do anything it takes to get there, and I'm not going to let anything stand in my way." He must have
thought getting to heaven was just another power play.
And power plays are the key to right wing psychology. Right wing psychology is the other thing that
Blumenthal has to offer. At the periphery of this world is your run-of-the-mill bully, a man like Jack Abramoff,
whose brutality is well remembered by his high school classmates, but who sang like a bird once he was caught.
At the center of is James Dobson, a much more destructive figure than Abramoff, who advocates, in the
strongest terms, child beating, and not only child-beating, but dog-beating. At one point he brags about going
after the family canine (who weighed twelve pounds) and engaging in "the most vicious fight ever staged

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764139 Date: 07/31/2015
between man and beast." As for children, the goal is to keep beating the child until "he wants(s) to crumple on
the breast of his parent." In other words, Dobson is a proud sadist who thinks sadism is kind of funny, and who,
over the years, has successfully advocated sadism as the only workable form of child-rearing.
It order to understand the deeply disturbing effect Dobson and his theories have had on our culture, Blumenthal
cites Erich Fromm's Escape from Freedom, about the psychology of Nazism and authoritarianism, and Eric
Hoffer's The True Believer. Insofar as he finds the documentation, Blumenthal points out how many of these
powerful Evangelical Christians were beaten and abused as children (including Dobson). It's a high number.
The beatings, often arbitrary, cruel, and frequent, were then, in many cases, backed up with constant lessons
about God--that he is arbitrary, that he is cruel, that he demands obedience above all things, and that he
surpasseth understanding. The point of these exercises is to establish the powerlessness of the child, his shame
and guilt as a worthless sinner, and his absolute fear of thinking for himself He will then take his place in the
hierarchy and thereby reinforce the existence of the hierarchy.
Blumenthal goes pretty far with this psychology, but, in my view, not far enough. I'm sure he was reared by
liberal parents, who gave him a sense of responsibility, curiosity, and autonomy, and since he is only in his
thirties, I don't think that he really empathizes with the tortured and damaged souls that he has been
interviewing and watching for the last few years. I don't think he understands their fear--how deep it is, how
constant it is, and how arousing it is. I don't think, in fact, that Max Blumenthal looks within and sees evil. I
think he looks within, and says, "I'm okay; you're okay." That's the goal of liberal parenting, and as we can tell
by statistics he cites concerning unwed pregnancy, divorce, and occurrence of STDs, liberal parenting works--
atheists and agnostics, for example, have a much lower rate of divorce than Evangelicals, and states that have
sex education in the schools, rather than abstinence-only education, have lower rates of teen pregnancy.
But a child who is beaten enough eventually comes to understand two things above all--that the world makes no
sense (and so why try to make sense of it?) and that the world is so dangerous that to be oneself, or even to try
to figure out what oneself might be, is a death-defying exercise. There is safety only in two things--conforming
to a group and, as a part of that group, dominating and even destroying other groups. The rules of the group can
be anything at all, as long as the members of the group abide by them. And other groups have to abide by them,
too, or the painful and arbitrary rules that group abides by are meaningless. The beaten child's sense of terror
can only be assuaged by evanescent feelings of power, because in relation to his parents and to God, he is
defined as powerless. When he "crumples" on the "loving" breast of his parent (and in my view a person who
administers a beating to a living being who is 1/16th his size doesn't know what love is) he accepts his
powerlessness and he also accepts that power is what defines this life.
That's where your freedom and mine come in.
Many of the Evangelicals Blumenthal discusses are Christian Dominionists--that is, they differ from the Taliban
only in their choice of doctrine. Their uses of that doctrine (to dehumanize women and other groups, to never
share power, to control every aspect of every life within their power, and to create society as a steeply
hierarchical structure with them at the top) are those of the Taliban.
It's an eye-opener to read about R.J. Rushdoony, son of Armenian immigrants who fled the Armenian genocide
of 1915. You would think that a man whose family escaped mass murder would go on to espouse peace, love,
and understanding, but Rushdoony went the other way, taking literally the 613 laws in the Book of Leviticus. In
his book, The Institutes of Biblical Law, he advocates capital punishment for "disobedient children, unchaste
women, apostates, blasphemers, practitioners of witchcraft, adulterers," and homosexuals. Gary North, the
Presbyterian Christian Reconstructionist, is his son-in-law, and, while not backing down on the mass death
penalty, advocates stoning rather than burning at the stake, because stoning is cheaper (and of course that is a
factor, because there would be a lot of people to exterminate). As for who would be doing the killing (of you
and me, if they could catch us), well, Christians would, but not because they wanted to. Ever unable to accept
responsibility, they assign agency to God, who wants us killed, who will beat us until we "crumple" on his
"loving" breast, a God who has given us all sorts of talents, skills, and interests, but is, like these Christian
Dominionists, interested only in power. I believe his motto is "Adore me or I will hurt you."
Can you believe in a God so small? When I was a parent of young children, I, too, got frustrated, and I, too,
thought a spanking might be a good thing. I soon realized that my motives for administering physical
punishment were highly suspect--more anger and frustration than care for the child or knowledge about
effective methods. I then saw a show about child-rearing, in which a woman who firmly believed in child-

beating aroused far more resistance in her beaten daughter, and had much more family disruption, than the
parents who ignored the tantrum and then used the technique of redirection to train their toddlers. Works with
horses, dogs, and other animals, too. It was then I decided that if I, in my human weakness, could put two and
two together concerning free will and proper behavior, surely God could, also. I didn't want to believe in a God
who was a smaller being than myself. And I don't.
The ray of hope in Blumenthal's book is that the right-wingers he talks about tend to be so psychologically
unstable that they don't have much staying power--think Ted Haggard. But they have numbers. The bad thing
about that is that they could take control. The defeat of Sarah Palin, Conrad Burns (R-MT), George Allen (R-
VA), Rick Santorum (R-PA), James Talent (R-MO), and Mike DeWine (R-OH) brought us "back from the
brink" according to the website Theocracy Watch. But only back from the brink. The good thing is that they
would not be able to maintain what we call a government for very long (see George W. Bush). The bad thing is
that they would destroy the country as we know it while they were trying. If I take the long view, well, I think,
Stalinism lasted about 25 years, Nazism 12. The Iranian Mullahs have been at it for 30 years. Russia and
Germany survived, Iran might, as well. But generations were lost in all these places. And Stalin and Hitler
didn't have nuclear weapons.
I think about the 22-year-old clerk in that convenience store, looking down the barrel of that pistol. He probably
had no idea that his killer had no sense of agency, hardly even knew what he was doing, was seeing his hand as
separate from himself. But I have to feel sorry for the killer, too, subject to feelings that he could not label that
were terrifying and overpowering. I bet he was beaten, shamed, and neglected as a child. I bet, afterward, he
wished someone, somehow, had stopped him.
Don't forget to buy one: Max Blumenthal, Republican Gomorrah, Nationbooks, available at your local
bookstore and anywhere else that
books are sold.

Note from Joe Wilson... Sid
Hillary: I'm passing on a note below from Joe Wilson. Sid
Dear Madame Secretary,
It was great to see you, albeit briefly, at the US —Africa business summit. Your speech spoke to the entire
audience as I'm sure you felt from the response. I also appreciate your offer to meet with me the next time we
are both in Washington and would like to take you up on it.
I am now working with a serious American engineering and construction company, Symbion Power, that has
been hugely successful in Iraq and Afghanistan (on fixed cost contracts). It specializes in power plants,
substations and transmission towers and lines. It made its name in Iraq constructing transmission towers and
pulling lines across al Anbar province at the height of the war there. Its business model is to partner with local
companies and to train local employees to do the construction, maintenance and repair, and to provide the
security. In Iraq and Afghanistan they established training centers and graduated over 3000 certified
linemen. They partner with an American Lineman College in Idaho to provide the ed ucation and
certification. We think the model is well adapted to Africa and have already begun work on a training center in
Tanzania, where we will be bidding on all of the upcoming MCC financed power generation and distribution
projects. I have asked Sid to pass a memory stick with a four minute video that explains what Symbion does
and how it does it.
I tell you all this, not to tout Symbion (about which I am very enthusiastic) but let you know that we are doing
much of what you have been advocating in your public comments about human capacity development. The fact
that we have been successful on fixed cost contracts also speaks to your criticism of American companies that
have been milking the government with their cost plus contracts for the last nine years. Our goal is to
demonstrate that an emphasis on developing local talent is not just the right thing to do but is also good
business.
I look forward to seeing you the next time I am in Washington. I know how precious your time is, and very
much appreciate your generosity.
With warm regards and best wishes.
Joe

Thursday, 8 October 2009
SPONSORED LINKS:
Eight years ago I was standing on a hill 50 miles north of Kabul watching the flashes in the night sky
as the US air strikes started again st the Taliban front line. There were a few ineffective puffs of fire
from Taliban anti-aircraft guns which could do nothing against the bombs and missiles raining down
on them.
It was a strange war to cover, not least because so little real fighting took place. The reputation of the
Afghan fighting man is partly based on agilely joining the winning side at the right moment. In the
meantime they don't fight too hard for anybody and try to avoid getting killed.
The US and British press mostly reported the war of 2001 as a real military conflict and rather missed
the point that the Taliban had just gone home. I remember visiting the former headquarters of a
Taliban armoured brigade in the city of Ghazni south west of Kabul. The tanks and armoured vehicles
had all been smashed to pieces by American bombs, but when I asked local people how many men
the Taliban had lost, I was told "none at all. They could see what was going to happen so they just
ran away."
Just as the US military victory of 2001 was overstated, so eight years later is the sense of military
crisis which is being busily stoked by Gen Stanley A McChrystal, the top US and NATO commander
in Afghanistan. In Washington military officials are quoted as saying that the war will be won or lost in
the next twelve months.
This is nonsense. The Taliban have been able to advance so rapidly in the last three years because
they have Pakistani backing and because of the spectacular political and military weakness of
President Hamid Karzai's government. But the Taliban draw all their strength from the Pashtun
community, which makes up 42 per cent of the Afghan population. They will have great difficulty
advancing into areas occupied by the other 58 per cent of the population where there is a Tajik,
Hazara or Uzbek majority.

Squads of six or eight Taliban on motorcycles might be harassing the roads around Kabul, but there
is no need to treat them as if they were North Vietnamese divisions at the gates of Saigon in 1975.
The strength of the Taliban is that not that they can take and hold territory, but that they can inflict
quite small military losses on the US which are politically unacceptable back home. They can do this
through roadside bombs, something the US army speaks as i f it were a new device, though it was
being used against the British army in Ireland in 1921. If the Americans and British try to hold territory
supposedly cleared of Taliban with penny packets of troops then these are vulnerable to being
suddenly targeted by the other side.
It is to prevent this happening that Gen McChrystal has asked for an extra 40,000 soldiers. But
Afghans tell me that more foreign troops will simply mean more violence and dead Afghans as more
of the country becomes a battlefield. It is absurd to imagine that the world's most heavily equipped
military force is not going to use its weapons when it comes under attack. Polls also show that
Taliban support is at its height in just those areas where Afghan civilians have been killed by
American shells and bombs.
So what should Obama do? First of all he has time. He is not going to win or lose the war in the next
year. Like it or not he is stuck with Mr Karzai and he should get used to the idea. It is reasonable to
suggest helping to produce a larger Afghan army and police force but this cannot be done overnight.
Most military recruits are there for the money and are too malnourished even to wear American flack
jackets. Speeding up security training f or Afghan police meant over the summer that terrified men,
often on heroin, were being sent to man dangerous and isolated police posts with just three weeks
training. Many of them did not come back.
One way Obama could strengthen the Afghan army and police is to make sure their men are paid
properly. In Kabul many facilities are being guarded by policemen earning $70 a month, which is not
enough to live on unless supplemented with bribes. This contrasts with $250,000 a year paid to
foreign consultants who lurk inside heavily defended compounds. Paying the Iraqi army properly
really did make a difference in Baghdad and might do the same in Afghanistan where 40 per cent of
men are unemployed. A difference is that Iraqi oil revenues last year were $62 billion while the
Afghan government is dependent on foreign aid.
The US and its allies will have to pay. It is carefully thought out measures like this that Obama should
be considering and not the panicky dispatch of US Special Forces or tens of thousand of more troops.

fyi: Hague report and DeMint... Sid
H: Here's the Guardian account of Hague's post-meeting press briefing. And below that the article on DeMint. S
William Hague addresses US fears over Tories'
EU allies
•Hillary Clinton 'told antisemitism allegations are a smear'
•Shadow foreign secretary opposes Tony Blair as EU leader
• Ewen MacAskill in Washington and Nicholas Watt
• quardian.co.uk, Thursday 22 October 2009 00.33 BST
William Hague, the shadow foreign secretary, yesterday defended the Conservatives' alliance with far-right parties in
Europe during a meeting in Washington with the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton.
Hague sought to reassure Clinton about the Conservatives' partners, some of whose members have taken part in
commemoration services for the Waffen-SS in Latvia and questioned the need to apologise for an anti-Jewish pogrom in
Poland.
The shadow foreign secretary, who said he had an excellent meeting with Clinton, told her the accusations were part of a
smear campaign by the Guardian and others.
The row has overshadowed Hague's visit to Washington intended as part of the Conservative preparations for taking
power.
Speaking to the media afterwards, Hague said the behaviour of Michal Kaminski, of Poland's Law and Justice party, was
not consistent with anyone who was antisemitic. As for the Latvian party in the Conservatives' European alliance, Hague
said: "This is a respectable party in Latvia ... To suggest it is antisemitic or neo-Nazi is ludicrous."
Jewish groups in the US and in Europe have expressed anger over the Tory links.
The state department was careful not be drawn into the issue, not wanting to be accused of interference in UK politics or
issues relating to the European parliament. A spokesman said: "I can say that the two had a good, wide-ranging
discussion on a broad range of issues, but can't get into details or substance of that discussion."
Hague tried to persuade Clinton that the Conservatives' Euroscepticism would not necessarily mean Britain would play a
lesser role in European affairs. The US favours the EU acting in unison over Iran and other issues.
Hague said he had raised the allegations of antisemitism with Clinton at the end of a 40-minute discussion on Iran, the
Balkans, the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Afghanistan and climate change.
"No one has raised with me all day the other issue, of the parties in our grouping, but I raised that with secretary of state
Clinton because of press reports in your newspaper [the Guardian] and others in case she had seen those," Hague said.
"I have assured her they are mainstream parties of the centre-right ... The Conservative party rejects what it regards as a
smear campaign against some of its members."
He noted that Kaminski made his first speech in the European Parliament highlighting the problem of anti-semitism in
Europe and had just completed a successful visit to Israel. "These are not the habits of someone who is anti-semitic,"
Hague said.
As for the Latvians, of the six governing parties, "five of them have members involved in the type of commemoration that
have been criticised." Some were members of the Conservatives' previous alliance, the European People's party.
On Conservative Euroscepticism, Hague said: "I always put the case to all American leaders that it is important to
distinguish between Europe's institutions and its capacity to act ... I have explained to her and others that she will be find
a Conservative government very active and activist from the very beginning in European affairs. "
Later he said it would be a mistake for Tony Blair to become EU president. He has previously said in private that Blair
would be appointed "over my dead body".

Iran-Contra's Scary Sequel
by Art Levine
The Daily Beast
October 10, 2009 I 6:55pm
Republicans have opened a new front against Obama, a southern front, south of the border—Latin America.
The clique of conservatives that has operated since the Iran-Contra scandal and held key policy offices in the
George W. Bush administration is waging war against Obama in part through Sen. Jim DeMint of South
Carolina.
A freshman on the Foreign Relations Committee with no previously known expertise on Latin America, DeMint
is best known for boasting that health care would be the "Waterloo" that will "break" Obama. He recently
provoked a nasty spat within the committee by requesting funding to travel to Honduras to "assess" the crisis.
The Obama administration favors reinstalling the democratically elected president, Manuel Zelaya, a leftist who
was expelled by the military in June. Committee Chairman John Kerry criticized DeMint for his "intransigence"
in putting a hold on two Obama nominations for State Department jobs in Latin America, and initially denied
money for DeMint's trip. But Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell somehow found funding through the
Defense Department.
"DeMint has been using this issue cynically to hold hostage the entire U.S. policy on Latin America in order to
defend a coup," says Adam Isacson, a Latin American specialist at Washington's Center for International
Policy.
"Little Honduras has brought all of the ghosts of the Cold War out of the closet, and paralyzed policy by
provoking the [DeMint] holds," Julia Sweig, the director for Latin American Studies of the Council on Foreign
Relations, told me. Some Hill staffers are even blunter: "These losers from the Bush administration who drove
Latin American policy off a frickin' cliff are trying to rescue their legacy," one aide told The Daily Beast.
A number of Democrats and foreign-policy experts contend the mounting right-wing attack on Latin American
policy has filled a void left by an Obama administration that was too slow to cut aid or take a firmer stance
against the president installed by the Honduran military, Roberto Micheletti. Driven partly by a desire to
appease opposition in Congress and distaste for left-wing populists the Obama administration "slow-walked" its
response to the coup this summer, Sweig says.
More recently, though, the administration has toughened its approach by cutting off some vital aid worth at least
$35 million and blocking Honduran officials' visas. The goal: to pressure the Micheletti regime to enter into
serious negotiations with the Organization of American States to restore the democratic government and Zelaya.
Informed observers say that indications of Micheletti's flexibility alarmed some right-wingers in Washington
and helped trigger DeMint's visit to buck up the regime's resistance.
An informal network of right-leaning American advocacy groups and ideologues was entangled in anti-Zelaya
legal and PR battles in Honduras before the coup. Among them: Otto Reich, a Cuban-American who headed the
State Department's now-defunct Office of Public Diplomacy during the Iran-Contra scandal, and was
subsequently investigated by a special joint congressional panel—and the U.S. Comptroller General, which
found he engaged in "prohibited covert activities" by using public funds to attack Reagan's critics. Reich, who
was later appointed by President George W. Bush to be assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs and
is now a private consultant, launched a media campaign against Zelaya before the coup alleging corruption.
"Your Loony Left sources say I was an architect of Iran-Contra like they say I'm an architect of the Zelaya
coup," he told me by phone from Panama. He disputes claims of illegal Iran-Contra activites as "crap,"
asserting they were only based on a fired House staffer's unpublished memo. But Greg Grandin, a Latin
American history professor at NYU, has a darker view of Reich's role: "It's kind of the origins of Swift
Boating," he says. "It's all related to what he's doing now."
Conservative supporters of the current Honduran government argue on arcane legal grounds against the
worldwide condemnation of the coup. "It's not the first time all, the countries in the world have been wrong,"
Reich told me. He has criticized what he sees as erroneous reporting on Latin American controversies, taking
The New York Times to task for an article last Thursday that he says implied he was being paid to lobby on

behalf of the Micheletti regime. "I guess my facts interfered with [the] story," he says. "Can you believe some
of my sources say The New York Times is malicious and deserves the slow death it is experiencing?" A
DeMint spokesman says the senator hasn't even met with Reich to talk about Honduras, although a Reich aide
says they've spoken to DeMint's staff.
Adding to the mystery of the coup, left-wingers in Latin America and the U.S. have floated what conservatives
say are unproven conspiracy theories that Reich somehow played a role in destabilizing Zelaya's regime. He
has firmly denied them to The Daily Beast: "I cannot possibly answer all the Loony Left conspiracy charges
against me. But I will try: I had nothing to do with the removal of Zelaya." But the rumors may add to his aura
of power as founder of Otto Reich Associates. He's drawn more attention to the new Honduras allegations by
penning a column for the Miami Herald boldly headlined, "I Did Not Orchestrate Coup in Honduras."
Perhaps the primary influence on DeMint's thinking has been the right-wing Honduran-American lawyer
Miguel Estrada, whose 2001 nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit was rejected by the
Senate. In addition to Reich, other former Bush administration officials who have played key roles in
influencing DeMint and in spreading arguments for the Honduran regime include Roger Noriega, a former aide
to the late Sen. Jesse Helms (the far-right chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee) who also served as an
assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs from 2003 to 2005. On July 2, Noriega appeared on The
NewsHour with Jim Lehrer to argue the legitimacy of the new Honduran regime. He was identified as a former
ambassador to the Organization of American States and a visiting fellow of the American Enterprise Institute—
not as a paid agent for pro-regime forces.
Noriega officially registered his firm, Visions America, as representing a Honduran business group only in mid-
July. Yet, the Times reported, he worked with the Association of Honduran Manufacturers to set up meetings
between supporters of the regime and eight U.S. senators—including DeMint—in early July. That visit to
Washington by Honduran business and political figures from July 2 to July 10, Foreign Policy reported,
occurred at the same time as a House committee hearing during which Reich—along with a former Honduran
supreme court justice and Lanny Davis, a former Clinton administration official and now a lobbyist—testified
in favor of the current regime. Noriega's office declined to return phone calls about his work.
The lobbyist-organized visit also coincided with Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings on Obama's
picks for top Latin American posts: Thomas Shannon, current assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere
Affairs, has been nominated to be Ambasssador to Brazil; and Arturo Valenzuela, director of Georgetown
University's Center for Latin American Studies and senior director for Inter-American Affairs at the National
Security Council during President Clinton's second term, has been tapped to be assistant secretary for Western
Hemisphere Affairs. Both Valenzuela and Shannon were approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
in late July. Julia Sweig of the Council on Foreign Relations observes, "They're not polarizing figures."
But for now they're hostages in DeMint's war. At the July 8 nomination hearings, Valenzuela angered DeMint
by defending the administration's decision to condemn the overthrow as a coup: "In my studies of military
coups in Latin America, this was a classic military coup," Valenzuela said. DeMint's critics contend that he has
continually refused compromise offers from both State Department officials and fellow senators to lift his holds,
including the promise of an extensive floor debate on Honduras before a floor vote on the nominees.
DeMint's spokesperson, Wesley Denton, says he's acting in good faith out of genuine concern about an
important crisis. "If these nominees are such a top priority for Democrats, then why hasn't Senator Reid brought
them to the floor?" he asks. "There is nothing Senator DeMint can do to stop a full debate and roll-call vote on
them." Technically that's true, but it would be a rare violation of a Senate tradition to do so. DeMint has taken
up the issue of Honduras, Denton claims, because, "the State Department's actions were directly relevant to two
nominees seeking the committee's approval."
Yet before DeMint took up the crusade on Honduras—in what critics say is yet another vehicle to "break"
Obama—one congressional observer jokes, "He couldn't find Honduras on a map."

Barack Obama snubs Gordon Brown over private
talks
White House spurned five requests from PM's aides for bilateral meeting
Gordon Brown and Barack Obama at a joint news conference at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in
London in April 2009. Photograph: Jason Reed/Reufers
Gordon Brown lurched from being hailed as a global statesman to intense embarrassment tonight, after it
emerged US President Barack Obama had turned down no fewer than five requests from Downing Street to
hold a bilateral meeting at the United Na tions in New York or at the G20 summit starting in Pittsburgh today.
The prime minister, eager to portray himself as a leading player on the international stage in America this week,
was also forced to play down suggestions from inside his own party that he might step down early, either due to
ill health or deteriorating eyesight.
There have been tensions between the White House and No 10 for weeks over Brown's handling of the Scottish
government's decision to release the man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi.
Brown's efforts to secure a prestigious primetime slot for his keynote speech at the general assembly in New
York were also thwarted when the Libyan leader, Colonel Gaddafi, delivered a 100-minute speech to the UN,
massively running over Brown's 15 minute slot.
Brown had not only been seeking a bilateral meeting with Obama, but feelers were also sent out to hold a joint
press conference, an event that would have boosted Brown's efforts to offer himself as a linchpin of
international diplomacy. Government sources said that Britain even changed its policy on swine flu
immunisation in Africa to match that of the Obama administration last week, in an attempt to rebuild relations.
No 10 denied there had been any hint of a snub, saying Obama and Brown had plenty of chances to talk as they
sat next to one another at the summits. They insisted they were working closely on issues such as future
economic regulation, bankers' bonuses, nuclear non-proliferation and climate change. Brown himself insisted: "I
do say that the special relationship is strong, it continues to strengthen."
But Obama has held bilateral meetings in New York with the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, the Russian
president, Dmitry Medvedev, and the new Japanese prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama.
News of the five spurned approaches compounded a miserable day for Brown at home which saw a
parliamentary aide resign over the prime minister's refusal to sack Lady Scotland, the attorney general, after she
was fined £5,000 for employing an illegal immigrant, as well as a withering attack by the former home secretary
Charles Clarke.
Stephen Hesford, Labour MP for Wirral West, told Brown in a resignation letter: "In my view, the facts of the
case do not matter. It is the principle which counts, particularly at a time when the public's trust of Whitehall is
uncertain to say the least. We have to be seen to be accountable."
Brown was also savaged by Charles Clarke, who told the Evening Standard that in his view Brown's leadership
risked letting "the whole Labour ship crash on to the rocks of May 2010 [the expected date of the general
election] and sink for a very long time". He said he hoped rumours that Brown would quit would come true. "I
think his own dignity ought to look to that kind of solution."
In two interviews , Brown was forced for the first time to field questions about his health. "My sight is not at all
deteriorating," he told NBC.

Asked on BBC Radio 5 Live whether he might quit for health reasons, the prime minister replied: "I am healthy
and I am very fit. I run a lot to keep fit and I will continue to keep fit.
"I keep going. I have got a job to do. I have got work to do. We have got to meet this challenge."
In his own speech to the UN, Obama promised an end to the unilateralism marked by the previous Bush
administration, an approach that saw US and Britain working in tandem. In remarks that suggest Obama will
focus on broadening American alliances across the globe, he said: "The time has come for the world to move in
a new direction ... a new era of engagement based on mutual interest and mutual respect."
Last week, the White House had unusually briefed that Obama had told B rown in a phone conversation that he
disapproved of the release of the Lockerbie bomber on compassionate grounds, something No 10 had not
highlighted. Megrahi was released on the basis that he had three months to live, and then received a hero's
welcome as he returned to Tripoli.
Brown had said he respected the release, but insisted undertakings by the Libyans that the return would be low-
key had been broken.
In an attempt to distance himself from the Libyans, Brown moved to toughen his position against Colonel
Gaddafi after Libya's leader theatrically tore up the UN charter in his address. Gaddafi said the security council
should be renamed "the terror council".
Brown countered in his speech in New York later: "I am here to reaffirm the UN charter, not to tear it up. I call
on everyone to support its universal principles."
He urged world leaders to recognise that the next six months presented tests on climate change and terrorism
that were as huge as the banking crisis. On climate change he said: "If we miss this opportunity to protect our
planet, we cannot hope for a second chance some time in the future. There will be no retrospective global
agreement to undo the damage we have caused. This is the moment now to limit and reverse climate change we
are inflicting on future generations."
He added: "If the poorest and most vulnerable are going to be able to adapt, if the emerging economies are
going to embark on low-carbon development paths, if the forest nations are going to slow and stop
deforestation, then the richer countries must contribute financially."
No 10 again denied that the prime minister had been snubbed last night. A spokesman said the stories were
"without foundation. As we have said throughout the week, the prime minister and President Obama are having
a number of meetings throughout the week. These included a wide-ranging discussion following last night's
climate change dinner. They will also be co-chairing an important meeting on Thursday on Pakistan and the
fight against terrorism. As the prime minister has already said, there will be further meetings at the G20 summit
in Pittsburgh."

Barack Obama rebuffs Gordon Brown as 'special
relationship' sinks to new low
Gordon Brown has been snubbed repeatedly by Barack Obama
during his trip to the United States, as the fall-out from the release of
the Lockerbie bomber appeared to have left "the special relationship"
at its lowest ebb for nearly 20 years.
By Andrew Porter, Political Editor in New York
Published: 11:49PM BST 23 Sep 2009
British officials made five attempts to secure official talks with the US President and even agreed to a policy
change in an attempt to land a joint appearance between the two leaders, said diplomatic sources.
But the White House rebuffed the offers and Mr Brown, who had hoped to increase his popularity by appearing
on his own with Mr Obama, had to settle instead for a snatched conversation with the President in a New York
kitchen.
The setbacks led to fears that relati ons between Downing Street and the White House were at their lowest point
since John Major's frosty dealings with Bill Clinton.
It was disclosed earlier this week that Mr Brown would not hold bilateral talks with Mr Obama, despite the
President hosting individual meetings with the leaders of Japan, China and Russia. Downing Street claimed that
this was not unusual.
However, a British diplomat told The Daily Telegraph that the White House's refusal to meet Mr Brown had
been a serious embarrassment for the Prime Minister.
"It is wrong for people to say that we have been relaxed about the way things have gone," the source said.
"There were five attempts to set up a meeting and none have come off."
The most striking example of Downing Street's desperation to engineer a meeting was a change of policy on
supplying swine flu vaccines to Africa. It aimed to match America's commitment and was announced last week.
As a result, it had been hoped that Mr Obama would agree to a joint press conference, according to a senior
source. However, the meeting never happened.
The White House said that Mr Brown and Mr Obama would chair a meeting tonight about Pakistan, and would
"spend all day Friday together." However, Friday's meeting in Pittsburgh involves the full G20 group of world
leaders.
The release=2 Oof the Lockerbie bomber, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi, appears to have been behind the
new chill in relations between Washington and London.
Mr Obama expressed his dismay at the release in a telephone call with the Prime Minister earlier this month.
Downing Street's original account of the conversation failed to refer to the President's anger.
Mr Brown has maintained that freeing the Libyan was a matter entirely for the Scottish executive.

Nearly 200 Americans died when Pan Am flight 103 was blown up over Scotland in 1988. Yesterday, families
of victims protested at the UN in New York where Mr Brown and Libya's leader, Col Muammar Gaddafi, made
speeches.
Last night Downing Street played down suggestions of a rift with the White House and pointed to an informal
discussion that Mr Brown had with Mr Obama after a climate change dinner at the UN on Tuesday night. The
15-minute "walk and chat" took place in a kitchen of the UN headquarters as both men left the building in
Manhattan.
No 10 maintained that there was nothing unusual in the Prime Minister not holding a separate "bilateral"
meeting with the President. There was little doubt that Mr Brown would have relished a high profile meeting
with Mr Obama.
In a speech to the United Nations, Mr Obama said the world must "move in a new direction" and "embrace20a
new era of engagement". That was seen as a sign that the President was more likely to place emphasis on
relations with a wide range of countries rather than rely on old alliances. Mr Brown's increasingly poor
relationship with the White House contrasts sharply with that of his predecessor Tony Blair, who enjoyed close
friendships with both Mr Clinton and George W Bush.
John Major's Tory government had difficulty with Mr Clinton, however, because of claims that Mr Major had
tried to help George Bush Snr's re-election campaign in 1992 by allowing researchers to dig into Mr Clinton's
student past at Oxford — something Sir John has always denied.
Mr Brown, whose plans for a lunchtime speech to the United Nations were derailed after Col Gaddafi spoke for
96 minutes, faced attacks on several fronts yesterday.
Kathy Tedeschi and Sue Kosmowski, Americans who lost husbands in the Lockerbie bombing, travelled to
New York to protest outside the UN headquarters. They claimed that Mr Brown had put trade interests ahead of
justice for victims families.
The Prime Minister was also accused of trying to appease Iran by ignoring the supression of opposition in order
to safeguard talks on its nuclear programme.
Shirin Ebadi, Iran's only Nobel Peace Prize winner, said the West cared more about its own securit y than
human rights.
Mr Brown was criticised for failing to stay at a dinner where he was honoured as Statesman of the Year. Guests
paid $1,000 to attend the function attended by, among others, Henry Kissinger and the pop star Bono.

because they don't want a strong president and floated the Miliband as EU foreign secretary story in order to

why it couldn't be published. Merkel remains the key. Having been for Tony, she is now neutral, but still
favorably inclined and doesn't know what to do. A nonentity as president would not appeal to her. Your

I suggest a night at the theatre, Mr Cameron
A sop to the party's Europhobes has left the Conservative leader defending the indefensible. He should be
ashamed
David Aaronovitch
On Friday morning David Cameron called upon David Miliband to apologise. On Friday evening I went to see a play. The
play was Our Class, by the Polish playwright, Tadeusz Slobodzianek.
In a series of short "chapters" Slobodzianek followed a group of classmates in a small Polish village from 1925 to 2002.
Like the village, the class was half Catholic and half Jewish. In 1941, as the Germans replaced the Russians as the
occupiers, almost all the Jews of the area were murdered in a single day. Slobodzianek shows what led up to the
massacre and what happened afterwards. It is unbearable.
Though the village is not named in the play, it is based on real events that took place at Jedwabne on July 10, 1941. As
Poland's Institute of National Memory concluded in 2002, on that day 40-50 Jewish men were forced to parade around the
town singing songs, and were then led to a barn on the outskirts where, one by one, they were killed with knives, axes
and cleavers and then thrown in a pit. Then 300 or more women and children were led from the town square to the barn
and locked inside. Kerosene was poured over the roof and walls and set alight. The screams could be heard from two
kilometres away; no one survived.
In 2001 it was finally acknowledged what many people had known all along. The murderers hadn't been Germans, but
local Poles, as depicted in Our Class. Alexander Kwasniewski, then the Polish President, apologised to the dead Jews
and their survivors at a ceremony in Jedwabne "in my own name, and in the name of those Poles whose conscience is
shattered by that crime".
History matters. Few believe that as much as the Law and Justice party of Michel Kaminski, who leads the Tory-backed
group in the European Parliament. The party's leaders have demanded apologies from the Russians for the massacre of
21,000 Polish officers at Katyn in 1940 and their references to terrible Polish historical suffering have constituted a big
part, of their political appeal.
But despite his historical sensitivity Mr Kaminski, the MEP for the Jedwabne area, did not support the 2001 apology. He
opposed it vigorously, associating himself with the "Committee to Defend the .Good Name of Jedwabne". Among its
leading members were the local priest, Edward Orlowski, who — asked by journalists whether he would be attending the
ceremony at which the President apologised — said: "These are all lies. it is not my business. Germans are responsible,
so why should we apologiSe?"
Mr Kaminski developed a slightly different rationale. As he told an interviewer for a far-right newspaper, Our Poland, the
murders — which he abhorred — were the work of a few outcasts, and that he would only apologise if someone "from the
Jewish side" apologised for how "the Jews" behaved during the Soviet occupation from 1939 to 1941. Last month Mr
Kaminski (who had denied giving the interview) confirmed this position. "If you are asking the Polish nation to apologise
for the crime made in Jedwabne," he said, "you would require the whole Jewish nation to apologise for what some Jewish
communists did in Eastern Poland."
It is this argument that so incenses me,•as it would anyone, I think, who had sat through Our Class. The idea of collective
Jewish Bolshevism was a major anti-Semitic trope before the war; it was a major element of self-justification after it.
Mr Kaminski denied the apology, denied the need for it, equated the massacre to "Jewish actions" and allied himself with
those who denied the massacre altogether, fulfilling the historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet's observation about patterns of
massacre denial: "it never happened, it happened but was justified, they did it to themselves, they did it to us." Mr
Kaminski's view was described as disgraceful by Mr Miiiband. Having read an enormous amount on Jedwabne in the last
few weeks, I think Mr Miliband is completely right — it is disgraceful. And as he might well demand of Mr Cameron: "I
should apologise?"

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765099 Date: 07/31/2015
But more than that, I find myself amazed by how Mr Cameron ever came to be in the position of demanding that a foreign
secretary, descended from Polish Jews, should apologise for possibly offending the sensibilities of a foreign politician who
vehemently opposed there being an apology for the massacre of Polish Jews. I think of all the things that Mr Cameron has
got right in his leadership of the. Conservatve Party and my mental jaw drops at the sheer wrongness of it.
Now Tory columnists, bioggers and activists are devoting their time to nitpicking sophistry about the nature of collective
guilt, and to attacking non-existent "smears" that they say have been attached to the unlovely person of Mr Kaminski.
Why?
It is true, as embattled Conservatives have argued, that many of the grand European coalitions contain people whose
history is problematic. There are odds and sods in the big conservative grouping, the EPP, and in the socialist group. But
these personalities are far outweighed by the parties of the IVIerkels and Sarkozys. The Polish member of the EPP, for
example, is the ruling free-market, non-nationalist conservative party of Donald Tusk — almost certainly the party that Mr
Cameron would join if he were a Pole. The new Tory grouping, the European Conservatives and Reformists, by contrast,
is all about odds and sods whom a continental Cameron would certainly shun, bar one organisation — the British
Conservatives.
So why get yourself into a position where you have to explain that the Latvian SS wasn't so bad really, and that Mr
Kaminski has an understandable position on collective guilt? And the answer seems to be that Mr Cameron promised his
Europhobes in his leadership campaign back in 2005 that he would leave the "federalist" EPP, and that the logical
outcome of this move has been the weird alliance that he now finds himself defending.
Was it all necessary? No. Was it in Britain's interests? Absolutely not. is it in the interests of progressive Conservatism?
You must be joking. So has this happened because Mr Cameron doesn't really care enough about Europe to think
through the consequences of his own lightly given promises, or because he's just as much a Euro-nutter as those sects,
the Hannanites, the Cashists and the Redwoodians?
This is the kind of advice I loathe, but I'll say it anyway. Go to see Our Class, Mr C. This is one hole you don't want to
keep digging.

France: 'Autistic Tories have castrated UK in
Europe'
French Europe minister says David Cameron's pledge to reclaim EU powers is 'pathetic' and will leave Britain isolated
Nicholas',Nat, Patrick yVintpur and :15;rattori.
c.,uardiari.,;:o.uk, Wednesday 4 November 2009 21.30 GMT
The Cohseri?t,vea were accused by the French government tonight of "castrating" Britain's position within the EU by
adopting an "autistic" approach that would take Britain off the radar.
Speaking to the Guardian, Pierre Lellouche, France's Europe minister, described as "pathetic" the Tories' EU plans
announced today, warning they would not succeed "for a minute".
Giving vent to frustration across the EU, which has so'far only been expressed in private, Lellouche — who said he was
reflecting Nicolas Sarkozy's "sadness and regret" — accused William Hague, the shadow foreign secretary, of a "bizarre
autism" in their discussions.
He said: "They have one line and they just repeat one line. It is a very bizarre sense of autism."
Lellouche, one of the most Anglophile members of Sarkozy's government, made his remarkable intervention after David
Caii.e.con outlined a fresh Tory approach to the EU in the wake of the full ratification of the Lisbon treaty.
A future Conservative government would seek to strengthen British sovereignty and repatriate a series of powers Over
social and employment legislation, the Tory leader said.
Cameron said he was not seeking an immediate "bust-up" with the EU, and would allow the repatriation of powers
negotiations to last as long as five years.
But that position was not enough for the Tory MEP Daniel Hannan, who quit his role as the party's legal affairs spokesman
in Europe, saying he intended to fight for referendums to enable Britain to become "self-governing".
France's centre-right government condemned Cameron's plans, saying that they would marginalise Britain within the EU.
Abandoning all diplomatic niceties, Lellouche said: "It's pathetic. It's just very sad to see Britain, so important in Europe,
just cutting itself out from the rest and disappearing from the radar map .... This is a culture of opposition ... It is the result
of a long period of opposition. I know they will come back, but I hope the trip will be short." He said Cameron's approach
was in line with the Tories' decision to abandon the main centre-right EPP grouping in the European parliament, of which
Sarkozy's UMP party is a member.
"They are doing what they have done in the European parliament. They have essentially castrated your UK influence in
the European parliament," he said.
Lellouche said he has told Hague personally that his position was a "waste of time for all of us".
"I have told William Hague: go away for two to three years, in your political economic situation you're going to be all by
your self and you'll come back. Go ahead and do it. That is my message to them ... You want to be marginalised? Well,
you go for it. But it's a waste of time for all of us," the French minister said.
Lellouche made clear the Tories had no hope of securing support for their plans. "It's not going to happen for a minute.
Nobody is going to indulge in rewriting [treaties for] many, many years. Nobody is going to play with the institutions again.
It's going to be take it or leave it and they should be honest and say that," he said. "It is a time of tumultuous waters all

around us. Wars, terrorism, proliferation, Afghanistan, energy with Russia, massive immigration, economic crisis. It is time
when the destiny of Europe is being defined — whether or not we will exist as a third of the world's GDP capable of fighting
it out on climate, on trade, on every ... issue on the surface of the Earth.
"We need to be united, otherwise we will be wiped out and marginalised. None of us can do it alone. Whether you're big
or small, the lessbn is the same. And [Britain's] risk is one of marginalisation. Irrelevance." He explained: "Finally we have
institutional package, but it took 15 years of looking at our navel and getting everybody bored to death with sterile debate".
In a sign of France's determination to resist the Tory plans to opt out of key EU legislation, Lellouche warned the French
would attempt to reduce Britain's EU budget rebate which will be up for negotiation during the next parliament.
He pointed out that France is a net EU contributor to the tune of €5bn (E4.5bn), unlike Britain which receives a rebate.
"If we get a government that is ferociously anti European that will vote down this kind of legislation then I think the
relationship is going to be very difficult. As we enter the next phase one of the issues we have to discuss midterm is of
course finances. France is a net contributor to the tune of €5bn a year, of which €1.5bn is the same as British rebate. That
should tell you quite a bit huh?" he said.
Cameron will be angered by the attack, and what it implies for Tory relations with the rest of Europe although in the short
term he will be more concerned to ensure his strategy of abandoning a referendum on the Lisbon treaty does not provoke
cries, of betrayal on his backbenches.
Hague reacted to the French criticism by insisting that Lellouche's comments did not represent the true reception of the
Tories' plans in Europe.
"That is not how we are seen across Europe," he told BBC2's Newsnight, adding his party had established good relations
with Sarkozy's party.
"1 don't think you will find that's representative of the reaction in Paris or other European capitals," he added.

Re: Agenda with Merkel
The Transatlantic Economic Council was Chancellor Angela Merkel's major initiative when Germany held the
EU presidency in 2007. She got President George W. Bush to agree to its formation. But the council now
languishes. Has the US appointed its representative? The council is more about coordinating regulatory matters
than trade, by the way. Raising Merkel's project and reinvigorating it would undoubtedly be well received.
Below is an article from Europolitics Daily from January 2009 on the council. State could work this up.

By Brian Beary ir, Wa:thingi:nri I Friday 16 ,nbluary 2009
As Barack Obarna was coasting to victory last November, the leader of the Socialist MEPs, Martin Schulz, urged him to
"make sure Europe is on the top of his in-tray". Two months on, there is considerable doubt as to whether Obama wilt
indeed take this advice or leave Europe lingering towards the bottom of the pile. Nowhere is this danger more striking
than with the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC), the body German Chancellor Angela Merkel persuaded President
George Bush to set up in April 2007 to remove regulatory barriers to transatlantic trade.
STILL NO TEC CHAIR
Obama has been widely praised for moving quickly, by comparison to previous new presidents, to ,nominate his new
administration. Yet his spokesman told Europolitics he has still not appointed the future co-chair of the TEc. In the
interim, Michelle O'Neill, Deputy Undersecretary at the Department of Commerce, has been tasked with ensuring
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765119 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765119 Date: 07/31/2015
continuity. The EU Co-Chair is Commission Vice-President Gunter Verheugen. Given that dozens of nominations have
already been announced, this may be a sign that among his long list of priorities, the TEC, the most significant EU-US
initiative to emerge in recent years, will not feature highly. it should be noted that when Obama was chair of the Senate
Subcommittee on Europe, from 2007 to 2008, he did not organise a single hearing, something on.which his then rival in
the presidential campaign, Senator Hillary Clinton, tried - and failed - to score political points.
The Democrats, who have grown more protectionist-minded on trade, now have a commanding majority in both the US
Senate and House of Representatives: Obama, himself a Democrat, is being careful to cultivate good relations with them
and not take for granted their support, which he desperately needs to push through his ambitious economic policy
agenda. It was Congress that in 2007 introduced the 100% rule, requiring all US-bound containers leaving European ports
to be scanned before being loaded onto the departing ship. This has been a thorn in the EU's side ever since and now
features on the TEC agenda. In the current climate, Congress is unlikely to be clamouring to scrap the rule and may not
even wish to extend the 2012 implementation deadline as the EU is asking. Anxious not to burn bridges, Obama could
well go along with Congress in order to avoid an unnecessary fight.
AMERICANS NOT SO HOT ON TRADE
Congress' protectionism does not magically appear in a vacuum. it is reflective of mounting fears among the US public
about the impact free trade has on US jobs. Their fears are not entirely groundless. American manufacturing jobs are
indeed going overseas notably to India and China. And being unemployed in the US is a more perilous predicament
than in Europe because government unemployment benefits are less generous and more temporary.- Moreover, most
Americans, unlike Europeans, have their health care paid for by their employer so if they lose their job they also lose
their health care. Hardly surprising, therefore, that only 59% of Americans think trade is good for their country,
compared to 78% of French and British, '80% of Czechs and 85% of Germans, a Pew Research centre survey has shown.
This.bearish sentiment has a knock-on effect on all trade dossiers. For example, it makes Congress less amenable to
scrapping the law requiring US airlines to be in 'actual control' of US citizens - something the EU is urging in the current
Open Sky II aviation liberalisation talks. It makes US lawmakers more likely to take action to prevent European companies
winning lucrative US defence contracts. This is happening already with the epic tussle between Boeing and Airbus over
the Pentagon's US$35 billion refuelling tanker contract (see separate article). EU officials are clinging to the hope that
Obama, as president, wilt adopt a more global outlook and drag the Democratic Congress along with him rather than
the other way around.
A VICTIM OF DULLNESS?
The TEC, despite having failed to deliver as much as many hoped for, remains an extremely useful tool. By emphasising
regulatory rather than tariff barriers, it shows an understanding of where the real problems tie in today's trading
environment. The EU and the US could use the TEC to create a global standard in hugely important sectors, such as toys
and food. "The alternative," as Dan Hamilton, director of the Centre for Transatlantic Relations at Johns Hopkins
University in Washington notes, "is that we end up with Chinese standards".
Yet the TEC has one weakness no one should underestimate: its dullness. Discussing highly technical regulatory
divergences, such as whether to wash chickens in chlorine or water, may have been Chancellor Merkel's cup of tea but
French President Nicolas Sarkozy showed little interest in-it during the French EU Presidency. Without strong impetus
from someone on Obarria's team who has the power to make things happen, the TEC - like an old soldier - might not -
actually die but just fade away.
:11..1-.1;` eoonooly
While there is much talk about the rising power of China and India, the transatlantic economy still far outstrips
the rest of the world in size and wealth. The EU27 and the US accounted for nearly 57% of world gross domestic'
product in 2007, while the transatlantic economy made up 47% of world exports and 52% of world imports. The net
worth per household in the US is US$565,000, in France USS518,000, in the U.K. US$599,000, compared to just
US$18,000 in' China, US$31,000 in Russia and US$44,000 Brazil.

Economic Council (TEC), the body German Chancellor Angela Merkel persuaded President George Bush
to set up in April 2007 to remove regulatory barriers to transatlantic trade.
STILL NO TEC CHAIR
Obama has been widely praised for moving quickly, by comparison to previous new presidents, to

nominate his new administration. Yet his spokesman told Europolitics he has still not appointed the
future co-chair of the TEC. In the interim, Michelle O'Neill, Deputy Undersecretary at the Department
of Commerce, has been tasked with ensuring continuity. The EU Co-Chair is Commission Vice-
President Gunter Verheugen. Given that dozens of nominations have already been announced, this
may be a sign that among his long list of priorities, the TEC, the most significant EU-US initiative to
emerge in recent years, wilt not feature highly. It should be noted that when Obama was chair of the
Senate Subcommittee on Europe, from 2007 to 2008, he did not organise a single hearing, something
on which his then rival in the presidential campaign, Senator Hillary Clinton, tried - and failed - to
score political points.
The Democrats, who have grown more protectionist-minded on trade, now have a commanding
majority in both the US Senate and House of Representatives. Obama, himself a Democrat, is being
careful to cultivate good relations with them and not take for granted their support, which he
desperately needs to push through his ambitious economic policy agenda. It was Congress that in 2007
introduced the 100% rule, requiring alt US-bound containers leaving European ports to be scanned
before being loaded onto the departing ship. This has been a thorn in the EU's side ever since and now
features on the TEC agenda. In the current climate, Congress is unlikely to be clamouring to scrap the
rule and may not even wish to extend the 2012 implementation deadline as the EU is asking. Anxious
not to burn bridges, Obama could well go along with Congress in order to avoid an unnecessary fight.
AMERICANS NOT SO HOT ON TRADE
Congress' protectionism does not magically appear in a vacuum. It is reflective of mounting fears
among the US public about the impact free trade has on US jobs. Their fears are not entirely
groundless. American manufacturing jobs are indeed going overseas - notably to India and China. And
being unemployed in the US is a more perilous predicament than in Europe because government
unemployment benefits are less generous and more temporary. Moreover, most Americans, unlike
Europeans, have their health care paid for by their employer so if they lose their job they also lose
their health care. Hardly surprising, therefore, that only 59% of Americans think trade is good for their
country, compared to 78% of French and British, 80% of Czechs and 85% of Germans, a Pew Research
Centre survey has shown.
This bearish sentiment has a knock-on effect on all trade dossiers. For example, it makes Congress less
amenable to scrapping the taw requiring US airlines to be in 'actual control' of US citizens - something
the EU is urging in the current Open Sky II aviation liberalisation talks. It makes US lawmakers more
Likely to take action to prevent European companies winning lucrative US defence contracts. This is
happening already with the epic tussle between Boeing and Airbus over the Pentagon's US$35 billion
refuelling tanker contract (see separate article). EU officials are clinging to the hope that Obama, as
president, will adopt a more global outlook and drag the Democratic Congress along with him rather
than the other way around.
A VICTIM OF DULLNESS?
The TEC, despite having failed to deliver as much as many hoped for, remains an extremely useful
tool. By emphasising regulatory rather than tariff barriers, it shows an understanding of where the
real problems lie in today's trading environment. The EU and the US could use the TEC to create a
global standard in hugely important sectors, such as toys and food. "The alternative," as Dan Hamilton,
director of the Centre for Transatlantic Relations at Johns Hopkins University in Washington notes, "is
that we end up with Chinese standards".
Yet the TEC' has one weakness no one should underestimate: its dullness. Discussing highly technical
regulatory divergences, such as whether to wash chickens in chlorine or water, may have been
Chancellor Merkel's cup of tea but French President Nicolas Sarkozy showed little interest in it during
the French EU Presidency. Without strong impetus from someone. on Obama's team who has the power

ARNAUD DE BORCHGRAVE
UPI Editor at Large
WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 (UPI) -- If we are successful beyond President Obama's wildest dreams -- e.g., the
Taliban is wiped out and a tough new Afghan government does not allow al-Qaida or other terrorists to conspire
against us on their territory -- would that make us safer from radical Islam? The answer, of course, is no,
because this is riot about geography. Two veteran intelligence operatives with much Middle Eastern and Afghan
experience, speaking not for attribution, agreed a stable, secure Afghanistan doesn't change the equation, at least
not significantly.
The popular perception of al-Qaida in Afghanistan is the same propaganda news clip, shown a gazillion times
over the last eight years, replete with terrorist "trainees" in shalwar-kameez (knee-length shirts over baggy
pantaloons) running through obstacle courses and emerging from tunnels, presumably to kill us all in our beds.
Al-Qaida doesn't need commando-steeled volunteers to attack the United States and its allies. For the next Sept.
11, the chances are they have already selected highly motivated, brainwashed wackjobs among the graduates of
Pakistan's madrassas, who look forward to a one button push to the land of plenty in the sky where 72 impatient
maidens await their arrival. Al-Qaida's "martyrs" don't need Afghan training camps for WMD terrorism. In fact,
to be inconspicuous, they should not have the physique of an avoid-at-all-cost likely to arouse suspicion.
Al-Qaida does not need Afghanistan for its next terrorist objective. In fact, those who follow events in
Afghanistan closely were taken aback when Obama said Afghanistan was a war of necessity because that's
where al-Qaida. is. They haven't been there since Afghanistan was liberated in October 2001. They moved to
Pakistan's tribal areas where they attracted volunteers from the Middle East and Europe. When a reconstituted
Taliban insurgent force re-entered Afghanistan in large numbers in 2004, al-Qaida was not interested in its now
insecure old training camps. Even if Pakistan's current offensive.against the Taliban and al-Qaida in the tribal
areas is successful, al-Qaida is not an entity that can be captured or destroyed. Its clandestine operatives are
widely scattered in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, North and South America.
As alternatives to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Yemen, in the vernacular of the intelligence community, will do/is
doing it. Somalia will do/is doing it. West African states whose writ doesn't extend much beyond their capitals
will do/are doing it. Grimy North African suburbs of major French cities will do/are doing it. British provincial
towns with Pakistani enclaves will do/are doing it. And the Internet's thousands of pro-al-Qaida Web sites will
do/are doing it.
Osama bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri are believed to be comfortably installed in a tribal chiefs
compound somewhere near Quetta, the capital of Pakistan's constantly rebellious Baluchistan province, which

has 48 percent of the country's land with. only 10 million of its 175 million people. There is no al-Qaida central
issuing orders to thousands of adherents the world over.
If the:re is no connection between Afghanistan and the core problem of "no more Sept. lls," what are the United
States and 41 friendly nations doing there? Even in the event of a Taliban victory in the years to come, the
Taliban would not be stupid enough to invite al-Qaida back. Three months prior to Sept. 11, 2001, there was
palpable tension between Taliban leader Mullah Omar and bin Laden. Omar complained that bin Laden was
issuing "too many fatwas (religious edicts) which he has no business doing as he didn't complete his religious
education." Omar also prevented journalists from seeing bin Laden. The Taliban leader knows he lost power
and his country because of what bin Laden and his terrorists did to the United States.
In today's Afghanistan almost everything turns out to be corruption and mismanagement. The average citizen
has seen little benefit from expenditures in the $250 billion range -- on top of $1 trillion in Iraq. The .U.S. effort
has been plagued by fraud, laced with mismanagement and bereft of strategic focus. One example among many
others came in 2007 when the United States awarded a massive contract worth some $300 million to A:EY, a
Florida-based company, to supply the Afghan army with 52 types of ammo, chiefly bullets for AK-47s. All
requirements for safety inspections, mandatory for all ammo delivered to U.S. forces, were removed. Thus AEY
was able to shop around in Eastern Europe for the cheapest ammo available. Millions of rounds of old Chinese
ammo made in the 1960s turned out to be substandard. and dangerous.
The State Department was aware of what was going on but did not object as speed was the only criterion. AEY
and its officers were eventually indicted in Florida. But U.S. officials involved got off with a slap on the wrist.
Wherever U.S. inspectors look, they find fraud and abuse. There are even cases -- reported by GlobalPost
reporter Jean Mackenzie -- of American contractors paying bribes to the Taliban to ensure aid projects are not
disrupted. This is a recipe for a war without end. She also reports a disguised Taliban office in Kabul that
reviews all aid projects and determines the amount to be paid to the Taliban.
If true, the United States is paying the Afghan government to fight the Taliban while also paying the Taliban to
fight the Afghan government.
The key lies in Pakistan. Almost all terrorist trails in Europe lead back to Pakistan -- and its madrassas. These
are the free Koranic schools that have stepped into the vacuum of no education system for the poor as the
military takes up 50 percent of government revenue. A fraction of what the United States has spent in Iraq and
Afghanistan would go a long way to turning Pakistan around. Instead, Congress, in its infinite wisdom, after
authorizing $1.2 trillion in both wars allocated $7.5 billion to Pakistan over five years -- with umpteen caveats.
In a country of 175 million, a drop in the proverbial bucket.

Report: Obama's national security team
'incredibly weak'
Wed, 11/04/2009 - 1:45pm
Despite an expansion of the National Security Council staff, coordination of national security policy is still dysfunctional
and there is a lack of strategic guidance from President Obama, according to a group of leading outside experts and
former officials.
"Reform must take place," said dames Lalher, President & CEO of the r!-olect on n; alone! Security Reform (PNSR), If
you did not like what happened in the last 7 or 8 years... you're not going to like what's coming in the future."
"Momentum for reform is building, but it is largely rhetoric and good intentions," reads PNSR's .new report . The
congressionally funded group was begun as the result of a cooperative agreement between the Defense Department and
the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. "Strategic management of the national security system remains absent
and is desperately needed to make it integrated, cohesive, and agile," the report continues.
Calling reform of the national security infrastructure "the number one national security issue," Locher said that America's
ability to operate in international arenas the world over is "crippled" by the dysfunction within the system.
He called the White House's national security staff "incredibly weak," preventing integration and coordination
that the National Security Council should be doing.
"There's almost no strategic guidance from the president or the executive office of the president," Locher said,
adding, "We have almost no knowledge management in the national security system."
There's also no effective means for delegating the president's authority, he added.
Locher spoke a an event rolling out the latest PNSR report at the New American Foundation; hosted by its foreign policy
chief and editor of V/gst1inc.Vgz? N.DtL:9 Steve Clemons.
Clemons noted that according to the Goldwater-Nichols act, President Obama was required to submit a national security
strategy by June 18, 150 days into his presidency, but he failed to do so.
The "Guiding Coalition" that oversaw the PNSR report included heavyweights such as former Lockheed Martin CEO
Norman Augustine, former Amb. Robert Blackwill, retired Gen. Wesley Clark, retired Adm. Ed Giambastiani, former
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell, plus Washington players Brent
Scowcroft, Thomas Pickering, and Joseph Nye.
Last November's version of the PNSR report included input from now Obama officials Jim Jones, James Steinberg,
Michele Flournoy, and Dennis Blair. It declared that "the national security of the United States of America is
fundamentally at risk."

Re: Berlin speeches
Below are my notes for speeches in Berlin. The themes I stress are these: the importance of Berlin and the
Brandenburg Gate as symbols of freedom; the weight of history (always felt by Germans); the contribution of
the US and the salience of the Western alliance; the meaning of 1989 to today and especially the continuity of
the Western alliance; and segue from past to future.
What I have not done here but might be added are references to Angela Merkel (a courageous woman from the
east who embodies the highest values of the West); and specific policies. Those can be fitted in.
So, some ideas and language:
Twenty years ago the wall fell. Here, in Berlin, the moment when tens of thousands of citizens tore it down with
hammers and picks and bare hands is called "Die Wende," a phrase that means more than simply a change but a
turning point in history. It was not only a turning point for Germany and Europe but also for the United States
because the wall—the reason for its construction and the reason for its destruction---is central to our common
history—and to our common future.
Richard von Weizsaecker said, "As long as the Brandenburg Gate is closed, the German question will remain
open." Today I can say with finality, the German question is closed, because the Brandenburg Gate is wide
open! The gate is open, Europe is open, and our future together is open.
In the forty years from the Berlin airlift to the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Atlantic partnership proved itself the
most successful alliance for freedom in history. That alliance was, is and shall be the crowning achievement of
American foreign policy. And the German – American relationship has always served as its foundation. Our

alliance represents the reconciliation of former enemies, an inspiration to other peoples and continents
devastated by war and hatred, and it must never be taken for granted.
In the twenty years since the fall of the wall we have created architecture for an enduring peace. Instead of a
wall we have built a gateway to the future. President Kennedy said in 1963 that in the future free men
everywhere will say, "Ich bin ein Berliner." Today Berlin has gained a new and even more powerful meaning.
Forever into the future, the opening of this Gate will be the symbol of the return of the dream of freedom, not
only to Berlin and Germany, but to the entire world.
The Gate, we must remember, was not built as a symbol of freedom. And each of the tyrannies that used the
Gate as a symbol believed it represented their eternal power. The Gate was first erected as a symbol against the
French Revolution; then it became a symbol of the imperial ambitions of Napoleon who marched his army
through. It was a symbol of Prussian militarism and monarchy. It was seized by the Nazi Party as the symbol of
its 1000 year rule. And then it became a symbol of the Communist totalitarianism that built a wall to separate
the people of Berlin as though freedom could be contained in only one part of the city. Here, in Berlin, the Cold
War was coldest.
We celebrate the fact that the wall that marred this proud city was taken down by the world's most enthusiastic
wrecking crew. The United States always believed in the freedom of Berlin because we believed in the future of
freedom. The courageous citizens of East Germany, Poland and other nations of the Communist bloc
demonstrated their dedication to free and peaceful solution of conflicts through their stand against dictatorship.
America stood resolutely as an ally at every moment of this struggle and moved swiftly to help the peoples of
Europe reunite after 1989.
We celebrate the steadiness of purpose, the restraint and respect for ultimate goals that allowed the Cold War to
end in peace. For how the victory was won was essential to the triumph. 1989 was special. It was that rarest of
historical events: a revolution that did not descend into violence. As a result the Gate survives not as a
cautionary monument to history's darkest moments but to its brightest. Today we celebrate the revolution of
1989, the turning point that transformed the Brandenburg Gate into the symbol of the hope of democracy and
the promise of freedom.
Berliner Luft, the air of Berlin; has always been unique. I can feel and smell the spirit of freedom in your
streets. The great American poet Carl Sandburg called Berlin the Chicago of Europe. Chicago is where I was
born and raised. I can sense the same energy, openness and dedication to hard work in both great cities. Another
Chicagoan, President Barack Obama, was drawn to Berlin last July, a city that he said made him feel like a
citizen of the world and a citizen of the future.
I was very proud to visit our new Embassy at the Brandenburg Gate, located exactly where the Wall used to
run. Our presence here will forever underscore our determination that the spark of freedom from this city in
1989 will help light the torches of freedom throughout the world.
The revolution of 1989 did not mark the end of history. Having made history together, we are summoned to
secure freedom for future generations. As vital at the beginning of the 21S' century as it was in the last half of
the 20'1', the Western alliance is called to new tasks. The dreams of 1989 reached far—and have farther to
reach. Old hatreds and conflicts—in the Balkins, the Caucauses, in the Middle East, East Asia, and Africa—still
simmer. We have much to demonstrate what we have learned from the last century. Without freedom, without
the rule of law, without the opportunity for people to support themselves and their families — without basic
human rights-- anger, aggression and violence will prevail.
Today we are faced with difficult and often dangerous conflicts arising not from conflicts between nations but
within them, conflicts exploited by zealots who make the false claim that violence will purify the world and
open the gates of heaven. Once zealots tried to use this Gate to symbolize that message. But through the

revolution of the spirit. The long twilight struggle to tear down this wall to make Europe whole and free inspires
us, in this new century, to help other peoples gain the same measure of security, respect and progress.

The Berlin event is personally meaningful for me, not least because I was, in 1986, when I was a reporter for the
Washington Post, detained and held in a cell inside the Berlin Wall, after spending a night with dissidents in the east (who
wound up being the leaders of New Forum and overthrew the regime). Have fun at the AdIon (William Shirer's old haunts).

will remain open." Today I can say with finality, the German question is closed, because the
Brandenburg Gate is wide open! The gate is open, Europe is open, and our future together is
open.
In the forty years from the Berlin airlift to the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Atlantic partnership
proved itself the most successful alliance for freedom in history. That alliance was, is and shall
be the crowning achievement of American foreign policy. And the German – American
relationship has always served as its foundation. Our alliance represents the reconciliation of

former enemies, an inspiration to other peoples and continents devastated by war and hatred,
and it must never be taken for granted.
In the twenty years since the fall of the wall we have created architecture for an enduring peace.
Instead of a wall we have built a gateway to the future. President Kennedy said in 1963 that in
the future free men everywhere will say, "Ich bin ein Berliner." Today Berlin has gained a new
and even more powerful meaning. Forever into the future, the opening of this Gate will be the
symbol of the return of the dream of freedom, not only to Berlin and Germany, but to the entire
world.
The Gate, we must remember, was not built as a symbol of freedom. And each of the tyrannies
that used the Gate as a symbol believed it represented their eternal power. The Gate was first
erected as a symbol against the French Revolution; then it became a symbol of the imperial
ambitions of Napoleon who marched his army through. It was a symbol of Prussian militarism
and monarchy. It was seized by the Nazi Party as the symbol of its 1000 year rule. And then it
became a symbol of the Communist totalitarianism that built a wall to separate the people of
Berlin as though freedom could be contained in only one part of the city. Here, in Berlin, the
Cold War was coldest.
We celebrate the fact that the wall that marred this proud city was taken down by the world's
most enthusiastic wrecking crew. The United States always believed in the freedom of Berlin
because we believed in the future of freedom. The courageous citizens of East Germany, Poland
and other nations of the Communist bloc demonstrated their dedication to free and peaceful
solution of conflicts through their stand against dictatorship. America stood resolutely as an ally
at every moment of this struggle and moved swiftly to help the peoples of Europe reunite after
1989.
We celebrate the steadiness of purpose, the restraint and respect for ultimate goals that allowed
the Cold War to end in peace. For how the victory was won was essential to the triumph. 1989
was special. It was that rarest of historical events: a revolution that did not descend into
violence. As a result the Gate survives not as a cautionary monument to history's darkest
moments but to its brightest. Today we celebrate the revolution of 1989, the turning point that
transformed the Brandenburg Gate into the symbol of the hope of democracy and the promise of
freedom.
Berliner Luft, the air of Berlin, has always been unique. I can feel and smell the spirit of freedom
in your streets. The great American poet Carl Sandburg called Berlin the Chicago of Europe.
Chicago is where I was born and raised. I can sense the same energy, openness and dedication to
hard work in both great cities. Another Chicagoan, President Barack Obama, was drawn to
Berlin last July, a city that he said made him feel like a citizen of the world and a citizen of the
future.
I was very proud to visit our new Embassy at the Brandenburg Gate, located exactly where the
Wall used to run. Our presence here will forever underscore our determination that the spark of
freedom from this city in 1989 will help light the torches of freedom throughout the world.

The revolution of 1989 did not mark the end of history. Having made history together, we are
summoned to secure freedom for future generations. As vital at the beginning of the 21st century
as it was in the last half of the 20th, the Western alliance is called to new tasks. The dreams of
1989 reached far—and have farther to reach. Old hatreds and conflicts—in the Balkins, the
Caucauses, in the Middle East, East Asia, and Africa—still simmer. We have much to
demonstrate what we have learned from the last century. Without freedom, without the rule of
law, without the opportunity for people to support themselves and their families — without basic
human rights-- anger, aggression and violence will prevail.
Today we are faced with difficult and often dangerous conflicts arising not from conflicts
between nations but within them, conflicts exploited by zealots who make the false claim that
violence will purify the world and open the gates of heaven. Once zealots tried to use this Gate to
symbolize that message. But through the courage and determination of the people of Berlin and
their stalwart allies, this Gate now stands for a true revolution of the spirit. The long twilight
struggle to tear down this wall to make Europe whole and free inspires us, in this new century, to
help other peoples gain the same measure of security, respect and progress.
We need Berlin more than ever today. We need your courage, your fortitude, your commitment
to the rights of men—and women—we need your example. We are hardly at the end of the
history of the West. Standing here, where a wall once stood but is no more, in the light from the
Gate, we have learned from history's deepest lessons. Our alliance, linked by shared struggle,
dedicated to the ideals of freedom and democracy, strong from the world we have built, now
faces a new world of challenges. And we are ready to meet and conquer them. We know it has
been done before. We are free men—and women—and proud to say, We are all Berliners.

Re: Westerwelle

The following are notes of my conversation this morning with Wolfgang Ischinger (who will be at the Berlin
event tonight). You will of course recall Wolfgang as the former director of the German Foreign Ministry and
ambassador to the UK and US. He knows Westerwelle very well, Wolfgang's former staff is now mostly
Westerwelle's senior staff and he understands Westerwelle's personality.
Wolfgang Ischinger
11/08/09
The important thing about Guido Westerwelle is that he's spent his entire life in politics. He's scored a dramatic
success for a small party, which has traditionally scored 9 to 10 percent, but now at 15 percent. He wants to
translate this victory into a sustained role for the Free Democrats in the system. There's a lot of ambition there.
He has not spent any significant amount of time on foreign policy, not his area of expertise, but he's a quick
study. He's a fluent English speaker, not a conservative at all, advocated the idea of a nuclear free world,
embraced fully. That is one operational area where the US can expect a lot of support.
He will make a real effort to maintain and expand a meaningful relationship with Russia. I don't see any friction
at all with the US. He's a transatlanticist by nature and training.
One footnote: Westerwelle has argued during the campaign and in recent speeches that he wishes to promote a
process that would allow the remaining US weapons in Germany, holdovers form the Cold War, to be
eliminated. It's not an anti-US point, but a German way of saying we are in favor of nuclear disarmament. It
should not be seen as a hostile act, but a German contribution to a nuclear free world.
He lives with a partner who has a PR agency. He represents a new generation that doesn't mind same sex
partnership, symbolizes a new, more liberal society where the traditional taboos are no longer in existence. He's

highly sensitive about it. He didn't come out of the closet for many years. There's a degree of vulnerability
behind it.
He's not a 'buddy" guy, who slaps people on the back. It takes time to develop a trusting relationship with him.
It's more difficult for him than others. He's a careful person in terms of personal relationships.
Hans-Dietrich Genscher is considered a trademark in Germany of successful diplomacy in the last decade
before the end of the Cold War and the transition. (Genscher was foreign minsiter from 1974-92.) If you can say
Genscher is your mentor that is thought to be reassuring in Germany. Kohl is out of circulation. Schmidt is
retired. Genscher is really the only one. That Westerwelle refers to his relationship is reassuring given that
Guido is not a foreign policy specialist. Genscher's blessing is good for him. At the personal level, the
relationship was never intimate. It would not be correct to say Westerwelle is a Genscher creation. He made his
own career.
Westerwelle is going to rely to a great extent on staff members who earned their experience in the Genscher
days (and worked with Ischinger). The senior staff that will now be appointed at the foreign minister will be
excellent—a lot of pro-transatlantic people in the lineup.
This is good news for the bilateral relationship. It will be easier to work this German foreign ministry than was
the case with Steinmeier.
Westerwelle knows that the one relationship he must manage well is the one with Secretary clinton.
My advice is that she works with him closely, as closely as with any European foreign minister, that would be
very beneficial. If she can embrace him and make him look good that make will things go well.

Sid,
Could you please pass the following to HRC. Thanks. Joe
Dear Madame Secretary,
When we last spoke at the Corporate Council on Africa you were kind enough to invite me to pay a call on you when in
DC. As it turns out, I will be in Washington for most of next week, arriving the afternoon of the 16th and returning to Santa
Fe the evening of the 201h ( the return is flexible if you were available to see me over the weekend.) I realize that you are
traveling this week and possibly into next, but I wanted to reach out to you. As I wrote to you earlier, I am a director for
Symbion Power and may soon assume more direct responsibility for all of Africa as Symbion expands there from its
current operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Symbion's competitive advantage is its reliance on local partnering and
human capacity development in the execution of its projects. Its success in the most difficult and dangerous
environments has been very impressive, as the four minute video that Sid gave to you on my behalf demonstrates. We
now want to bring that business model and philosophy to Africa where the social entrepreneurship and the development
of skilled labor is imperative for Africa's long term economic prospects, as you have so forcefully articulated in past
comments.
am very enthusiastic about Symbion. It is one or
the very few American companies outside the petroleum sector willing to establish itself and to undertake projects in
Africa. With our record of success elsewhere, we are certain that our approach to project development and execution will
mesh nicely with African needs and U.S. policy priorities.
Valerie, Trevor and Samantha join me in extending our best wishes to you, Bill, and Chelsea as we enter the holiday
season.

FYI: Murdoch makes his move to Cameron. Attack on BBC to follow. Sid
Has Cameron done a deal with Murdoch?
By Andy McSmith
Lord Mandelson's attack shines spotlight on Tory leader's
links with media mogul
David Cameron has been accused of making a "contract" with Britain's biggest media company to trade political support
before an election for government favours afterwards if the Tories win.
The accusation was levelled yesterday by the Business Secretary Peter Mandelson, who is increasingly the public face of
Gordon Brown's government. Ministers are angry at the campaign that The Sun has run against the Prime Minister all this
week over the spelling mistakes in a letter Mr Brown sent to the mother of a young soldier killed in Afghanistan.
They suspect that the Conservative Party has been tailoring its policies on media regulation and the BBC to suit the
commercial interests of News International, which owns The Sun, and that the paper's aggressive support for the Tories is
a pay-off that could spread to other parts of the mass media.
Examples of the apparent tie-in between what News International's boss, James Murdoch, wants, and what David
Cameron is ready to promise include the recent decision by the Conservatives to abandon the idea of "top slicing" the
BBC licence fee. It had been proposed that part of the money paid to the BBC would be siphoned off to help regional
television companies meet the threat from the internet. But this would also have helped them compete more effectively
against Sky News, which is part of the Murdoch media empire.
When the policy was abandoned in September, Jeremy Hunt, the shadow Culture Secretary, said that it was because
enacting it might make the commercial television companies "focus not on attracting viewers but on attracting subsidies".
There was no gain for the BBC in the climbdown, because David Cameron had already said that the Tories will freeze the
licence fee. What it will mean is that the BBC's income will be capped, without the regional television companies seeing
any government help, which will strengthen the market position of Britain's only satellite television company, Sky. "This
was done for News International," a Tory insider said yesterday. "Murdoch wants Sky to go head to head with the BBC.
He doesn't want the independent companies strengthened."
In April 2008, James Murdoch complained bitterly about the media regulator Ofcom in his first major speech after taking
over as chief executive of News Corporation in Europe and Asia. The following year, David Cameron announced that a
Conservative government would cut Ofcom down to size.
Last summer James Murdoch attacked the "abysmal record" of the BBC Trust - the body created by Labour to over see
the BBC - in a lecture he gave at the Edinburgh Festival, singling out its "total failure" to stop the BBC buying the Lonely
Planet travel guides, a takeover that Murdoch denounced as an "egregious" invasion of private enterprise by the state.
Less than two months later, Jeremy Hunt promised that the Tories would abolish the Trust.
In the same lecture, Murdoch complained that BBC performers like Jonathan Ross are being paid salaries that "no
commercial competitor can afford". He had barely uttered the words before Ed Vaizey, a shadow media minister,
promised that a Tory government would compel the BBC to publish the salaries of its top performers.
Lord Mandelson alleged yesterday that the Conservatives and News International had "effectively formed a contract, over
the head, incidentally, of the newspaper's editor and their readers, in which they are sort of bound to one another".
Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, he added: "What The Sun can do for the Conservatives during the election is
one part of the contract and, presumably, what the Conservatives can do for News International if they are elected is the
other side of the bargain. But there is a wider question. When The Sun creates the news in this way, this is then followed
up by Sky News, which then puts pressure on the BBC to follow suit."
This was "absolutely, categorically" denied yesterday by The Sun's political editor, Tom Newton Dunn, who accused Lord
Mandelson of talking "preposterous nonsense".

The Sun, which supported Labour through three general elections under Tony Blair's leadership, announced that it was
jumping ship on the day that Gordon Brown delivered his annual speech to the Labour Party conference in September.
Its onslaught on Gordon Brown for the mistakes made in a handwritten letter to Jacqui Janes is the most aggressive
attack that the newspaper has directed at any Labour Party leader since Neil Kinnock stood down after losing the 1992
general election, a defeat for which The Sun claimed victory with the slogan "It was The Sun wot won it".
But there were signs yesterday that the attack may have rebounded on The Sun. Mr Brown, who is blind in one eye, has
admitted that his handwriting is bad and has apologised to Mrs Janes, whose 20-year-old son, Jamie, was killed by a
makeshift bomb in Afghanistan last month.
A poll yesterday for the website PoliticsHome, whose main shareholder is the Conservative Party deputy chairman Lord
Ashcroft, found that 65 per cent of those polled thought that The Sun's attack was "inappropriate" compared with 23 per
cent who thought it was "legitimate".
The closeness of the new Tory-Sun axis is shown up by the revelation, from an inside source, that David Cameron
personally consulted the editor of The Sun, Dominic Mohan, in three separate conversations before he abandoned his
"cast-iron" promise to hold a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty, now that all 27 members states of the EU have ratified it.
Mr Cameron was understandably wary of how The Sun might react to the abandonment of that promise. The paper has
campaigned for years against what it sees as the growth of an EU superstate. It was in an open letter to readers of The
Sun that Cameron first made his guarantee, two years ago.
His announcement that a referendum is off the agenda was subjected to a scathing attack in'the Daily Mail, but in The
Sun it was given kid-glove treatment under the headline "Cameron's crusade for UK rights".
The person behind this aggressively pro-Tory policy is James Murdoch, not his father, Rupert, who created The Sun
virtually from scratch in the 1970s. Rupert Murdoch claimed in an interview with Sky News Australia that he "regretted" his
son's decision to turn against Gordon Brown, "who is a friend of mine", but defended it on the grounds that Brown has
been a "disappointment".
Yesterday, The Times, another Murdoch newspaper, announced that its veteran political editor, Phil Webster, is leaving
the Commons, where he has been based for decades. Mr Webster is very well thought of by New Labour. His
replacement, Roland Watson, was a friend of David Cameron's at Eton but has no political ties with the Tories.
Tom Newton Dunn, newly appointed as The Sun's political editor, is another Old Etonian. His father, Bill, used to be a
Tory MEP, but defected to the Liberal Democrats in 2000.

Subject: H: Also, two Quinnipiac polls, CT and OH, not good. S
November 12, 2009 - Dems Fade In Ohio Senate Race, Quinnipiac University Poll Finds; Obama Gets
Negative Score In Key Swing State
Word format
For the first time, Republican Rob Portman is inching ahead of the two Democrats in the 2010 race for Ohio's
U.S. Senate seat, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released today. Also for the first time, Ohio voters
disapprove 50 - 45 percent of the job President Barack Obama is doing, down from his 53 - 42 percent approval
September 16 and 49 - 44 percent approval July 7.
In still another first, voters are split 40 - 40 percent on who is doing a better job handling health care, the
President or Congressional Republicans, the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh- pe-ack) University survey
finds. In a September 16 survey on the same question, Obama was on top 49 - 28 percent.
Ohio voters disapprove 53 - 42 percent of the way the President is handling the economy and disapprove 57 -
36 percent of the way he is handling health care. In September, they approved of his handling of the economy
48 - 46 percent and split on his handling of health care 44 - 45 percent.
"The Democratic wave that swept through Ohio in 2006 and 2008 may be cresting. The Democratic lead in the
Governor's and Senate races has evaporated and for the first time President Barack Obama is under water in the
most important swing state in the country," said Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University
Polling Institute.
"Ohio voters are not happy with the President's handling of health care and the economy. The fact that they now
are split whether he or the Republicans in Congress are better able to handle health care should be a very
worrisome number at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. since the GOP is still pretty much a four-letter word in most of
America."
Independent voters, often the group that decides Ohio elections, disapprove 49 - 45 percent of the overall job
Obama is doing and disapprove 54 - 39 percent of his handling of the economy. They disapprove 62 - 34
percent, almost 2-1, of his handling of health care.
"In July, when the President's job approval began falling nationally from the high 50s and low 60s into the low
50s, Ohio was the first place it showed up in the polls," said Brown.
Portman, a former Congressman running for the U.S. Senate in 2010, has small leads over two Democrats,
topping Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner 38 - 34 percent and Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher 39 - 36 percent. In the
battle for the Democratic Senate nomination, Fisher gets 24 percent to Brunner's 22 percent, with 51 percent
undecided. Portman leads car dealer Tom Ganley 26 - 7 percent in a GOP primary with 64 percent undecided.

"None of the Senate candidates are very well known, but what is significant is that until now Democrats were
winning all the Senate matchups. Clearly there is an at least temporary swing toward the GOP in Ohio. Whether
it continues is anyone's guess," said Brown.
Ohio voters oppose Obama's health care plan 55 - 36 percent, with independents against it 57 - 33 percent. By a
61 - 35 percent margin, voters don't think Congress should approve a health care overhaul if it only gets
Democratic votes.
But Ohio voters support 53 - 40 percent giving people the option of a government health insurance plan.
Independent voters support this public option 55 - 38 percent.
Afghanistan
The United States is doing the right thing fighting in Afghanistan, Ohio voters say 48 - 43 percent. Voters
support 51 - 40 percent the recommendations of the top U.S. commanders in Afghanistan that 40,000 more U.S.
troops should be sent.
"But 55 percent of Ohioans say they are only willing to see large numbers of American troops in Afghanistan
for two years or less, which is hardly a mandate for the type of long-term commitment that the Pentagon has
said will be needed for victory," said Brown.
From November 5 - 9, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,123 Ohio voters, with a margin of error of +/- 2.9
percentage points. The survey includes 406 Republicans and 394 Democrats, each with a margin of error of +/-
4.9 percentage points.
The Quinnipiac University Poll, directed by Douglas Schwartz, Ph.D., conducts public opinion surveys in
Florida, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Ohio and the nation as a public service and for
research. For more data or RSS feed- http://www.quinnipiac.edu/polling.xml, call (203) 582-5201, or follow us

Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-CT) is still in serious trouble in his re-election race with 53% of voters saying he does not
deserve re-election, a new Quinnipiac poll finds.
Connecticut voters disapprove, 54% to 40%, of the job Dodd is doing, compared to a 49% to 43% disapproval in
September.
In general election match ups, Dodd loses to both Rob Simmons (R), 49% to 38%, and to Linda McMahon (R), 43% to
41%.

the administration's lack of achievable results so far in improving the living standards of ordinary people. There is no
reason why the deficit shouldn't become a merely abstract factor once there are actual benefits delivered. The pattern of
the past is that the deficit, the talisman of Hoover Republicans, moves only partisan Republicans and that Democrats
ascend if the economy is progressing, its gains are widely spread and new social programs have favorable universal
impact. That is not happening now. This analysis, therefore, may be portentous. Worth reading. The electoral maps of VA

Can the Clinton Coalition Survive Obama?
By Sean Trende
John Judis and Ruy Teixeira's well-regarded 2002 work The Emerging Democratic Majority begins with a vignette set in
Virginia. They tell the story of a telecom executive named Mark Warner, who runs a moderate campaign that appeals to
upper-middle class suburbanites and working class rural voters, and manages to put together a winning coalition that, if
imitated in other states, might put the Democrats in power for decades to come.
Democrats did build coalitions similar to Warner's, and in fact had been doing so for the better part of a decade. Warner's
coalition was essentially Bill Clinton's 1996 coalition. The coalition and brand that Clinton built was an extraordinarily
successful one for Democrats, breaking the momentum of a resurgent GOP in 1996, and ultimately enabling the election
of the most liberal President in American History last year.
Given this background, it's only appropriate that the first tangible sign that this coalition is coming unglued has come in
Virginia. Republican Bob McDonnell won the governorship with almost 59% of the vote — the highest percentage (though
not the highest victory margin) for any governor since 1961. The entire Republican ticket won by similar margins, and the
GOP picked up six seats in the General Assembly. It could have been even worse — five Democrats won their Assembly
races by fewer than 1,000 votes.
There are some superficial lessons to be drawn here. After last week's election, it's silly to argue that the GOP brand is
too damaged for them to take advantage of Democratic weakness. And the Democrats' latest spin — that their weakness
among Independents was simply a function of more Republicans calling themselves independents but retaining their
Republican voting habits — puts the lie to the argument that Republicans' low self-identification is a salient factor in
elections.
But the most important lesson is this: while there's little predictive value in off-year elections, they do provide snapshots of
the mood of the electorate, and the present state of political coalitions. Given Virginia's primacy in the story of Democratic
coalition building, it gives us a good snapshot of the state of that coalition. And it's not a pretty one for Democrats.
The historical base of the Democratic Party for two centuries has long been what Jay Cost and I call Jacksonians:
Culturally conservative, hawkish, and populist whites located throughout the South and Border states. They began

breaking away from Democrats in the 1950s and 1960s — their reaction to the Party's embrace of unions, blacks and
liberals is a story is so well known there's no need to rehash it here.
But this group remained at least in play for the Democrats. Clinton inherited a coalition consisting of minorities, liberals,
urban voters, and a decent remnant of Jacksonian voters in the Ohio River Valley and the South, who still preferred a
moderate-to-conservative Democrat to a Republican. This coalition became a majority coalition when Clinton used a
combination of fiscal conservatism and social moderation to bring suburban voters on board. This was a huge innovation
for Democrats; suburbs like Nassau County, NY, Orange County, CA and Fairfax County, VA had fueled the rise of the
Republican parties in those states. Clinton moved them substantially toward his side. This coalition allowed him to win by
eight points in 1996; absent Perot and a last-minute fundraising scandal, he probably would have won by more.
Clinton intuited that suburban voters are, generally speaking, culturally cosmopolitan — they don't like it when you call
someone "macaca," and aren't crazy about the religious right. But they're generally not particularly socially liberal either,
and are fans of "law and order." They like taxes low and appreciate economic growth, but like good schools and a clean
environment. Having to balance a bunch of spending priorities with somewhat limited income in their daily lives, balanced
budgets are the ultimate "good government" indicator for these voters.
Clinton delivered on all of these issues, keeping tax increases fairly small, and balancing the budget for much of his term.
In so doing — and this is very important — he re-branded the Democrats as the party of fiscal responsibility, economic
growth, moderate taxes, and smart government. In other words, he finally shed the "Carter" label for the Democrats. This,
in turn, made it plausible for his much more liberal heirs to benefit from this presumption of competence for Democrats -
one that they probably would not have enjoyed without him.
George W. Bush's presidency, in turn, was an upper-middle class suburbanite's nightmare. An aggressive social agenda,
a fiscal trainwreck, two poorly-managed wars and a financial collapse later, these suburban voters trended even more
heavily Democratic then they were in the Clinton era. By 2008, Democrats held most of the suburban districts around ,
major metropolitan areas, and were threatening in the exurbs. The right Democratic candidate probably could have put
together a massive 2008 Presidential majority, combining minorities, liberals, Jacksonians, Catholics, and suburbanites.
The mood of the country was certainly right for a 1920/1932/1952/1980 result.
But the Democrats nominated Barack Obama. The party's grip among Jacksonians had weakened since Clinton left the
stage, but they abandoned Obama completely. Jay Cost and I have detailed this here. This movement is why Obama
received 53% of the vote, instead of the 60% or so we might expect given the voters' attitude toward Bush's Presidency.
Obama was able to win even without this branch of the Democratic party because he generated such intensity among the
remaining portions of his base. In other words, while his base wasn't as broad as Clinton's, it was deeper. Faced with
vanishing 401ks and home values, and disgust with Bush's presidency, suburbanites flocked to him. Liberals were
enthralled to finally elect one of their own. And minorities turned out heavily for the opportunity to elect the first black
President.
But this presents a problem. You only get to elect the first black President once, and governing a coalition of suburbanites,
poor blacks, and upper class liberals isn't easy. It is hard to keep that enthusiasm up. And with the Jacksonian wing of the
party gone, if that enthusiasm dissipates, or if one of the coalition groups becomes disgruntled and starts to shuffle out the
door, the party isn't left with much.
We see a microcosm of this story in last Tuesday's elections, especially in Virginia. Let's backtrack to 2001, and look at
the counties that Mark Warner won.
The coalition that Warner built was similar to Clinton's. To oversimplify some, it blended together rural Democrats in the
mining counties in the west of the state, college voters around Charlottesville, and black voters combined with rural whites
in the south central and southeastern portion of the state with suburban voters in the northeast. It was a diverse coalition,
but it worked.
Now let's compare Warner's map with Obama's map in 2008:
The suburbs stayed in the Democrat's camp, for reasons discussed above. But look what happens in the west! That area
becomes solidly Republican. Buchanan and Dickenson counties in the Virginia panhandle voted for Dukakis, Mondale,
and Adlai Stevenson (twice). Obama became only the second Democrat to lose these counties since the UMW moved in
during the 1920s.
As I said, this isn't a problem so long as (1) the Jacksonians show a willingness to come back for a candidate other than
Obama and/or (2) the suburbs continue their love affair with the Democrats. But we see indications in Virginia that the
Jacksonian divorce may, in fact, be permanent. Creigh Deeds was from the western section of the state, and seemed — at
least on paper — capable of remaking the Mark Warner map. It didn't happen, obviously. Let's look at how Virginia
changed from Bush's 2000 election to Deeds' loss last week:
The redder a county is, the more it moved toward the Republicans from 2000 to 2009; bluer counties moved toward
Democrats.

We see that McDonnell did as well as Bush did in the suburbs — but no better. Those pockets of white are the DC
suburbs in the northeast, the Hampton Roads area in the southeast, and Richmond just to the north and west of Hampton
Roads. Its rural Virginia — which is still about 1/3 of the electorate — that made the difference between Bush's 54% in
2004 and McDonnell's 59% on Tuesday. Even with Obama off the ticket, and a much less cosmopolitan figure atop the
ticket, rural Virginia went solidly Republican.
We can take another angle here. Deeds and McDonnell squared off in a very close Attorney General race in 2005. Let's
compare Deeds' 2005 showing to his 2009 performance. [NOTE: In this map, we look at "relative movement." Because
everything in the state moved toward McDonnell, a map just showing "movement" would be solid dark red, and not of
much use. So instead, if something moved more than 9 points toward McDonnell, it is colored a shade of red, if it moved
less than 9 points toward McDonnell, it is blue. Think of this as showing the change in the counties' PVI].
We see the same result. Just since 2005, rural Virginia has moved sharply against the Democrats. The suburbs haven't
moved much at all, relative to the rest of the state, while the more heavily African American counties in the southern
portion of the state have moved a few notches leftward (in absolute terms, they voted in 2009 as they had in 2005). This
suggests lasting damage to the Democratic brand here that is not simply personal to Obama.
Now let's look at how McDonnell did when compared to McCain in 2008. Again, because the movement here was so
dramatic statewide, we need to isolate the biggest and smallest changes by looking only at "relative" shifts.
The western counties of the state didn't shift much from 2008, but that's because they were already giving Republicans
around 70% of the vote — there wasn't much room for Republican growth (and remember, "blue" in a relative map still
means slight movement toward the Republican since 2008)! The real Republican gains over the past year have come in
the DC exurbs, in the 1-95 corridor, and to a lesser extent in the Hampton Roads area.
In other words, the Jacksonians aren't returning to the Democrats, at least in Virginia. Deeds might still have been able to
win without them, but the Democrats are also showing weakness in the Virginia suburbs. In other words, two pieces of the
Clinton-Warner coalition are starting to break away.
This is a real problem for the Democrats. If the suburbanites and the Jacksonians move away from the party, there is
very, very little left for them. And there's reason to think that the suburban weakness is real. Obama's fiscal policy, to
make an understatement, hasn't been Clintonian. It may not be entirely his fault, but the $787 billion stimulus, the trillion
dollar healthcare bill, the automobile bailout, and the budget showing trillion dollar deficits extending for the next decade
make suburbanites shudder. They don't much like debt, and they intuit this spending is going to have to be paid for at
some point — probably by them. Voters still give Obama some benefit of the doubt, as they do most Presidents in their first
year, but they are becoming very, very worried, and probably don't put much stock in Candidate Obama's promise to
enact a net spending cut any more.
Democrats will doubtless chalk this up to Creigh Deeds' inept campaign. Deeds wasn't a great candidate, but when the
mood of the country is starting to swing against your party, it is hard to run a good campaign. Jerry Kilgore found this out
when he ran in a similar environment in 2005, and was reduced to attacking Tim Kaine for his religious views on the death
penalty. And if you run the Deeds-McDonnell race in 2006 or 2008, I think its hard to argue McDonnell would win by 18
points, even holding everything else equal.
The other problem with this explanation is that we saw similar results replicated around the country. Most of the seats in
the House of Delegates that the Democrats lost in Virginia, or came close to losing, were suburban. The Philly suburbs
voted Republican for the state Supreme Court. Bergen County New Jersey didn't give the Republican 60% of the vote like
it did in 1984, but Chris Christie nearly carried it, and even though he is significantly more conservative than Christie Todd
Whitman or Tom Kean, he won the largest margin for a first-term Republican Governor since 1969. Conservative
Republicans won elections in Westchester County, New York, and Republicans picked up two City Council seats on the
outskirts of Queens. Republicans won back the Nassau County legislature -- the Democrats' capture of that body figures
prominently in the introduction to Emerging Democratic Majority -- and nearly defeated the Democratic County Executive
there with an obscure, underfunded candidate. In other words, in places that have never heard of Creigh Deeds or seen
his attack ads on McDonell's thesis, the Democrats still lost suburban voters.
States with a Democratic base of liberals, urbanites, and minority voters -- like California and New York -- haven't moved
much against Democrats. Obama's polling numbers, as well as those of Democratic candidates for Governor and
Senator, in classic "Emerging Democratic Majority" states like Colorado and Nevada are not looking good at all. And of
course in Jacksonian states like Kentucky, he's below 40%.
This doesn't mean that Democrats are doomed in 2010. An improved economy, Republican missteps, and a host of other
factors could keep the band together for them. Maybe some of the more marginal voters that Obama brought to the polls
to enact hope and change will return in 2010 to keep hope alive. But the personal nature of Obama's victory is starting to
show its downside for downticket Democrats.
The Clinton coalition is looking creaky. If Obama doesn't improve and the coalition comes apart, Democrats could find
themselves weaker than they were even in the 1980s and 1990s.

http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-11-22/think-before-you-travel/?cid=hp:mainpromo2
The White House might try to blame the State Department (such an easy and delicious target) for the missteps. But
State's role in the conceptual planning of the trip was not central, and the department's senior Asia hand, Kurt Campbell,
surely knew better. It's also hard to tar the National Security Council's own senior Asia expert, Jeff Bader, another pro like
Campbell. Perhaps even higher officials at the NSC dropped the ball. Perhaps Mr. Obama might take responsibility
himself, as President Kennedy did after the Bay of Pigs fiasco in 1961. Now, that would truly clear the air—and open the
door to some obvious and necessary changes in the administration's decision-making machinery. Every decision, large
and small, is shaped and made by the president himself and enforced by Denis McDonough, a deputy NSC adviser and
the administration's Lord High Executioner. Does Obama get enough pushback? Is he hearing a range of views? Can he
see that his powerful intellect might profit from bowing to the voices of experience? If Mr. Obama reflects on the Asia
journey and other mishaps, he might loosen the reins and bring in additional policy and diplomatic pros as inside
counselors or outside advisers.
Amateur Hour at the White House
by Leslie H. Gelb
November 22, 2009 I 10:50pm
The Asia trip was not worth Obama's time. Leslie H. Gelb on why the president should shake up his
foreign policy team—and make sure the deals are done before he leaves home.
President Obama's nine-day trip to Asia is worth a look back to fix two potent problems, past and future. First, the trip's
limited value per day of presidential effort suggests a disturbing amateurishness in managing America's power. On top of
the inexcusably clumsy review of Afghan policy and the fumbling of Mideast negotiations, the message for Mr. Obama
should be clear: He should stare hard at the skills of his foreign-policy team and, more so, at his own dominant role in
decision-making. Something is awry somewhere, and he's got to fix it.
Secondly, the Asia trip presented an important opportunity to carve out a new American leadership role in the world's
most dynamic economic region, and Mr. Obama missed it. He only scratched the surface in his calls for multilateralism
and mutual understanding. He needs to paint pictures of how Washington will help solve regional security and trade
problems. Otherwise, most Asian nations will continue their unwanted drift toward China and away from the United States.
A meditation on his journey should start by forgetting half of the last week's commentary. Unbelievably, some criticized
Obama for not getting China to "throw its weight around." What Asian leaders want that? None that I know of. Others
lamented that Obama couldn't make "demands" on China anymore. The presumption here is that China is now king, and
that Washington can no longer have its way with Beijing. The facts are that Washington never did boss Beijing around,
and that China is not now ruling the roost (more accurately, it's sitting on its own eggs). Others contended that Obama
continued his pattern of trashing America's friends and coddling its authoritarian enemies like China. It's hard to stomach
this nonsense from the same conservative crowd that forever praised George W. Bush for accommodating China and
alienating America's allies.
Some analysts played fair and acknowledged that administration officials tried to tell reporters not to expect "deliverables"
on the trip, and to see the journey more as a recognition of Asia's new importance and America's desire for a new co-
operative spirit. That's a commendable thought, but hardly justification for almost two weeks of the president's time (when
you consider preparations)— especially when he's got a tanking economy, health-care reform woes, and decisions to
make on Afghanistan. Presidents take trips like this one only when they need breakthroughs and accomplishments on
certain issues that can't be agreed on without the pressure of an impending presidential visit. In fact, most presidents
wouldn't even commit to trips abroad without knowing that key deals would be finally agreed on and announced during the
visit itself. The prospective visit is the power jackhammer to nail down the deals. Just take a gander at trips planned for
Richard Nixon by Henry Kissinger or for George H. W. Bush by James Baker.

Obama's travels were a chance to settle or make concrete progress on thorny issues like greenhouse-gas emissions, and
the fate of U.S. bases on Okinawa, which the new Japanese government insists on moving. It was time to announce ways
to gain fixes on the U.S.-South Korean trade treaty, long stalled in Congress. It was a moment to show that Beijing would
actually make some mutually beneficial compromises on exchange rates or economic sanctions against Iranian and North
Korean nuclear programs. Absent guarantees of progress on issues such as these, Mr. Obama should have taken a well-
deserved vacation in Hawaii.
Matters were made worse on the scene. It was not good optics for Obama to bow to Japan's emperor. He seems to do
this stuff spontaneously and inexplicably, as with his bow to the Saudi King some months ago. And it was truly unfortunate
that Obama and his aides didn't flatly insist that he be allowed to address the Chinese people directly on television and
meet with non-stacked Chinese groups—as has been the case during previous presidential visits. Beijing's leaders
obviously didn't feel confident enough of their own standing at home to give the popular Mr. Obama such access. But he
and his team should have made it a precondition of the visit. Its absence left an unhappy taste.
The Asia trip presented an important opportunity to carve out a new American leadership role in the world's most dynamic
economic region, and Mr. Obama missed it.
The White House might try to blame the State Department (such an easy and delicious target) for the missteps. But
State's role in the conceptual planning of the trip was not central, and the department's senior Asia hand, Kurt Campbell,
surely knew better. It's also hard to tar the National Security Council's own senior Asia expert, Jeff Bader, another pro like
Campbell. Perhaps even higher officials at the NSC dropped the ball. Perhaps Mr. Obama might take responsibility

see that his powerful intellect might profit from bowing to the voices of experience? If Mr. Obama reflects on the Asia
journey and other mishaps, he might loosen the reins and bring in additional policy and diplomatic pros as inside
counselors or outside advisers.
If most Asia hands inside and outside the government had designed the Obama trip, here's what they would have
advised: Go beyond the usual and trite message of building mutual understanding and cooperation, and stop invoking the
God of Multilateralism without spelling out America's leadership role. Asia is now overflowing with multilateral
organizations. Washington is a member of a few key ones, like Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and the Asian
Development Bank. But that has little to do with other new and key groupings such as the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization (Russia, China, Uzbekistan, etc.) and ASEAN, the association of Southeast Asian nations. Asian nations are
increasingly organizing themselves into these groups, and Washington hasn't really figured out its role. Most Asian
nations want that role to be a prominent one—in fact, the leadership position. They're afraid of China, afraid that China
won't be as attentive to their concerns in the future as America was in the past. At the same time, they don't want
Washington to come into these groupings and cause problems with Beijing. They want Washington to figure out a
leadership position constructed on the proven American ability to help solve common problems in the common interest.
They want an America they remember, one that can get things done and doesn't let problems fester.
That U.S. policy was the main missing ingredient on Obama's trip. Washington played architect and solidified its
leadership in Europe after World War II with NATO, the Marshall Plan, and various trade and economic organizations like
the World Bank. Asian nations are yearning for the same kind of creativity today from a brilliant American president in the
new Pacific Era.

H: If Roubini is right, and he's been mostly right so far, one of the few, then without additional and large stimulus
devoted to putting a floor on job loss, the pressure on protectionism will be far more intense. (Protectionism, by
any name, should not be dismissed as a targeted tool in an ongoing policy to force China to revalue its currency.
The US is not without means here.) The deficit will be high in any case and the Republicans will always attempt to
exploit it no matter what its number. Whether another stimulus can pass Congress is another matter. Still, what
matters in the short-run--and long-run--are achievable results. To most people, the deficit is an abstraction;

The worst is yet to come: Unemployed
Americans should hunker down for more job
losses
BY Nouriel Roubini
Sunday, November 15th 2009, 4:00 AM
Think the worst is over? Wrong. Conditions in the U.S. labor markets are awful and worsening. While the official
unemployment rate is already 10.2% and another 200,000 jobs were lost in October, when you include discouraged
workers and partially employed workers the figure is a whopping 17.5%.
While losing 200,000 jobs per month is better than the 700,000 jobs lost in January, current job losses still average more
than the per month rate of 150,000 during the last recession.
Also, remember: The last recession ended in November 2001, but job losses continued for more than a year and half until
June of 2003; ditto for the 1990-91 recession.
So we can expect that job losses will continue until the end of 2010 at the earliest. In other words, if you are unemployed
and looking for work and just waiting for the economy to turn the corner, you had better hunker down. All the economic
numbers suggest this will take a while. The jobs just are not coming back.
There's really just one hope for our leaders to turn things around: a bold prescription that increases the fiscal stimulus with
another round of labor-intensive, shovel-ready infrastructure projects, helps fiscally strapped state and local governments
and provides a temporary tax credit to the private sector to hire more workers. Helping the unemployed just by extending
unemployment benefits is necessary not sufficient; it leads to persistent unemployment rather than job creation.
The long-term picture for workers and families is even worse than current job loss numbers alone would suggest. Now as
a way of sharing the pain, many firms are telling their workers to cut hours, take furloughs and accept lower wages.
Specifically, that fall in hours worked is equivalent to another 3 million full time jobs lost on top of the 7.5 million jobs
formally lost.
This is very bad news but we must face facts. Many of the lost jobs are gone forever, including construction jobs, finance
jobs and manufacturing jobs. Recent studies suggest that a quarter of U.S. jobs are fully out-sourceable over time to other
countries.

Other measures tell the same ugly story: The average length of unemployment is at an all time high; the ratio of job
applicants to vacancies is 6 to 1; initial claims are down but continued claims are very high and now millions of
unemployed are resorting to the exceptional extended unemployment benefits programs and are staying in them longer.
Based on my best judgment, it is most likely that the unemployment rate will peak close to 11% and will remain at a very
high level for two years or more.
The weakness in labor markets and the sharp fall in labor income ensure a weak recovery of private consumption and an
anemic recovery of the economy, and increases the risk of a double dip recession.
As a result of these terribly weak labor markets, we can expect weak recovery of consumption and economic growth;
larger budget deficits; greater delinquencies in residential and commercial real estate and greater fall in home and
commercial real estate prices; greater losses for banks and financial institutions on residential and commercial real estate
mortgages, and in credit cards, auto loans and student loans and thus a greater rate of failures of banks; and greater
protectionist,pressures.
The damage will be extensive and severe unless bold policy action is undertaken now.

US fumbling for a new China tone
Published: November 16 2009 20:39 I Last updated: November 16 2009 20:39
Gone are the days when the US president could visit Beijing as the unassailable top dog, able to lecture the Chinese on
everything from human rights to an overvalued currency. As has become fashionable to note, events have instead obliged
Barack Obama to play the role of washed-up debtor visiting his stern bank manager for yet another loan.
That analogy is useful. But it can be overdone. Certainly, the financial crisis has brought into sharp relief just how
dependent the US has become on foreign creditors, chief among them China.
It has also sharpened the perception of what had been happening anyway, the relative decline of a US-centric west and
the relative rise of a China-centric Asia. But the word relative is important. China, poor and riddled with internal
contradictions, is not there yet, by a very long way.
The changing relationship with China does demand a new tone. But early indications are that Mr Obama is still fumbling
for the right one. Take global imbalances.
In the only set-piece speech of his Asian tour — delivered in Japan, perhaps to assure his hosts that Washington is not
abandoning Tokyo just yet — Mr Obama correctly pointed out that the global economy cannot go back to business as
usual. "One of the important lessons this recession has taught us is the limits of depending primarily on American
consumers and Asian exports to drive growth," he said.
That is quite right. But his entreaties on global rebalancing fall flat in China. That is partly because Beijing remains publicly
sceptical about the US's long-term finances.
From China's perspective, Mr Obama's emergency measures to stimulate the US economy and persuade Americans to
spend their way out of recession smack of re-creating the spendthrift ways that triggered the crisis in the first place.
That explains why Chinese officials have quizzed their US counterparts so robustly about how they intend to pay for
healthcare reform. It is also why Beijing has started questioning US monetary, as well as fiscal, policy.
On the eve of the US president's visit, Liu Mingkang, China's chief banking regulator, took a swipe at the US Federal
Reserve, saying the combination of a weak dollar and low interest rates risked generating a global asset bubble. That is a
bit rich coming from someone who oversees a banking system that has pumped the equivalent of nearly 30 per cent of
gross domestic product into the economy so far this year. But it reflects the new tone with which China presumes it can
address a humbled superpower.
Mr Obama's efforts to occupy the moral high ground are also undermined by his flirtation with protectionism, particularly
his decision to slap tariffs on Chinese tyres.
His administration has failed to spell out a convincing trade policy — and that is seen as a stark omission for-a business-
oriented Asian audience. Such perceived deficiencies have hobbled his ability to cajole China with any real conviction.
When it comes to human rights, too, the US seems to have drawn the conclusion it is not good policy to badmouth its
chief creditor.
Hillary Clinton, secretary of state, set the tone early when she said that human rights should not "interfere" with matters of
implicitly greater urgency. Mr Obama obligingly omitted all references to Tibet, Xinjiang and even Taiwan from his Tokyo
speech. There was also not a single mention of India, a potential regional counterweight to China, yet another indication
that Washington is behaving as though it is treading on eggshells. It was therefore all the more refreshing to hear Mr
Obama criticise Chinese censorship during his town hall meeting in Shanghai on Monday — though even that could not
undo his own self-censorship in refusing to meet the Dalai Lama before this week's trip.

It is right and proper that the US acknowledge the rising significance of China. Mr Obama's assurances that China's rise
need not be a threat were spot on. But by the same token, US accommodation can be taken too far. Contrary to common
perception, China's huge holdings of US treasuries are not a sign of great strength. They are evidence of how dependent
Chinese growth has been on the US consumer.
Equally, any idea that China, with an economy less than a third the size of the US and a GDP per capita roughly the same
as Angola's, can somehow save the world is ludicrous. Mr Obama is right to show respect to China. He need not — and
must not — kowtow.

Expert Brief
The U.S.-China Economic Relationship: Separating Facts from Myths
Steven Dunaway, Adjunct Senior Fellow for International Economics
Author:
Former deputy director of the Asia and Pacific department at the International Monetary Fund. Author
of the Council Special Report, Global Imbalances and the Financial Crisis.
November 16, 2009
http://www.cfr.org/publication/20757/uschina_economic_relationship.html?breadcrumb=°/02Fregion%2F271%2Fchina
Many myths surround the economic relationship between the United States and China. Four, in particular, stand out, and
it is important to identify them as myths to avoid misunderstandings that could adversely influence policy decisions. The
fact that China has become the largest foreign holder of U.S. government securities is taken as indicating that the United
States is heavily dependent on China to finance its budget deficits. Similarly, since China is a major source for U.S.
imports, U.S. consumers are seen as dependent on cheap Chinese goods. In addition, the Chinese authorities have
emphasized that they strongly resist external pressures to try to influence policy decisions and that economic instability in
China is bad, with adverse implications for the rest of the world.
Taken together, these four myths could lead to the conclusion that China should not be pushed hard by the United States
(or other major countries) to more quickly change its policies, especially its exchange rate policy, to facilitate the
rebalancing of its economy. But such a conclusion would be a major mistake, and that is why during his trip to Asia,
President Barack Obama needs to dispel these myths and bring pressure to bear for faster economic policy changes in
China. This would be in keeping with the objectives for dealing with global imbalances laid out by the G-20 summit in
Pittsburgh in September 2009.
Myth No. 1: Washington has limited leverage because China is the main "banker" for the United States
China holds a large amount of U.S. government securities. Of China's $2.3 trillion in official reserves, it is estimated that
70 percent is held in U.S. dollar assets. China is a big customer for U.S. debt, but it is not America's banker. Nor is the
United States dependent on China to finance its budget deficits. If China elects not to buy U.S. Treasuries, there are other
willing public and private sector buyers, as indicated by the strong demand for these securities worldwide. Although the
U.S. government might have to pay higher interest rates as an incentive to get other investors to buy Treasuries in the
event that the Chinese reduce their demand, the increase in interest rates would likely be small.
Major consequences from a decision by China to reduce its purchases of U.S. Treasury securities would depend on the
reason behind the decision. It would be in China's best interest (and beneficial for the rest of the world as well) if China
reduced its purchases of U.S. Treasuries because it decided to stop heavily managing its exchange rate and allow greater
flexibility in the currency's movements. This is an important policy change that is required if China is going to rebalance its
economy and be able to sustain rapid growth.
China is a big customer for U.S. debt, but it is not America's banker. Nor is the United States dependent on China to
finance its budget deficits.
If instead China continues to heavily manage its exchange rate, it will build up large additional amounts of official
reserves. If it decides to hold less of these additional reserves in U.S. Treasury securities, then China will increase its
purchases of assets denominated in other currencies, with euro-denominated securities being the most likely alternative.
In these circumstances, China would continue to intervene in its exchange market, with the central bank buying U.S.
dollars for Chinese renminbi and then selling dollars for euro to acquire European assets. The result would be an
appreciation of the euro. Consequently, countries in Europe, not the United States, would probably be most affected by
China's move because the negative impact of euro appreciation on European economic activity would likely far outweigh
the effects on the United States of smaller Chinese purchases of Treasuries.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765795 Date: 07/31/2015
Alternatively, China could choose to start dumping its stock of U.S. securities. The result would be appreciation of other
major currencies (depending on where China would decide to park its reserve assets); upward pressure on U.S. interest
rates; and the possibility of financial market disruptions if China dumped its U.S. dollar assets rapidly. However, the U.S.
Federal Reserve could limit the rise in U.S. interest rates and would be able to ensure adequate liquidity to prevent market
disruptions. But a decision to dump Treasuries would have a large effect on China itself. The country would incur a
substantial capital loss on its reserve assets. The Chinese authorities are deeply concerned about such a loss, and are
very unlikely to decide to dump U.S. assets. In fact, the discussion initiated by China regarding the need for an alternative
official reserve asset is motivated by its concerns about potential losses on its U.S. dollar holdings.
Myth No. 2: The United States is heavily dependent on cheap Chinese goods
This is not really true. Only roughly 15 percent of U.S. imports come from China. Moreover, all of the basic types of
manufactured consumer goods that China exports to the United States (clothing, textiles, footwear, toys, small appliances,
etc.) can be imported from other countries or could be produced domestically. The prices for goods that could substitute
for products from China would be higher, but the difference in costs would be relatively small. Competition among
producers has become fiercer, and as a result cost differentials between goods from China and other suppliers are
narrowing.
Dependence actually runs the other way. China is highly dependent on U.S. demand for its products. Economic growth in
China is heavily dependent on exports. Although China has been able to achieve its 8 percent GDP growth target in 2009
owing to the stimulus to domestic demand provided by government policy actions, the country will struggle to meet this
objective in 2010 and succeeding years if demand for its exports in the United States does not pick up.
Myth No. 3: External pressure on China for policy changes is counterproductive.
The Chinese authorities stress that in the face of external pressure, they tend to strongly resist economic policy changes.
The Chinese have in particular used this argument to try to fend off pressures for appreciation of the exchange rate. While
no country wants to appear to be weak and susceptible to external pressure, the truth is that, if there is no pressure, there
is less incentive to change policy. This is especially true in China, where the authorities are wedded to the status quo
because of past success and inclined to make only gradual changes to economic policies. Recent developments in
China's exchange rate illustrate this point. In the absence of external pressure since August 2008, China has reverted to
fixing its exchange rate relative to the U.S. dollar.
Without a hard push from the United States on a bilateral and multilateral basis, changes in China's policies are likely to
be delayed, and that is not in the best interest of the United States and the rest of the world.
Myth No. 4: Instability is bad for China
Chinese authorities also have suggested that instability in China is bad for the rest of the world because of adverse effects
on China's growth rate. But instability (or the fear of instability) has played a big role in initiating economic policy changes
in China. For example, concern about instability arising from the growing gap between urban and rural incomes has been
a major factor behind new initiatives to develop China's interior (such as the Develop the West program) and to improve
conditions and opportunities for the rural population (including breaking down restrictions and discriminatory treatment of
migrant workers). Hence, for China, instability is not necessarily bad, but it is a problem for the authorities. Instability in
China also is not necessarily bad for the rest of the world because of its effect on China's growth. Although China
accounts for a significant portion of world GDP growth, the country does not generate much demand for products from
other countries given China's large trade and current account surpluses. Some countries in Asia and commodity
producers may be benefiting from China's strong growth, but overall, it is not providing much stimulus for the world
economy as a whole, so slower growth in China will have little effect on economic activity in the rest of the world.
It is important for President Obama to separate fact from myth in his economic policy discussions with the Chinese
authorities during this trip to Asia to build a sounder relationship. The president should not shy away from pushing the
Chinese hard on economic reform and rebalancing of China's economy, but this should be done in his private discussions
with China's senior leaders. Multilateral discussions, such as those in the context of the G-20 process, are a much more
effective forum for the United States to take a public stance on China's economic policies jointly with other major
economies.
Without a hard push from the United States on a bilateral and multilateral basis, changes in China's policies are likely to
be delayed, and that is not in the best interest of the United States and the rest of the world. It also is not in the best
interest of China, because without a shift away from heavy dependence on investment and exports to drive growth toward
greater reliance on consumption, China will not be able to sustain rapid economic growth and development. Getting China
to fully realize this and to act more quickly than the authorities are inclined to do is a considerable task for the United
States and other major economies.

Rep. Joe Wilson's Rebel Yell
Inside the racist klavern that Joe Wilson joined
By Max Blumenthal
Since Republican Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina bellowed at President Barack
Obama, "You lie!" during the president's nationally televised speech on healthcare,
the fourth term backbencher has emerged as a hero among the conservative
grassroots. One of the most enthusiastic endorsements of Wilson's histrionics came
from the Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV), a group that Wilson has <a
href=http://crooksandliars.com/david-neiwert/obama-heckler-joe-wilson-member-
neo>belonged to</a> for several years.
"Mr. Wilson, never apologize for allowing your love of truth to overrun your desire
to be polite," the SCV Tea Party <a
href=http://scvteaparty.com/?p=165>declared</a> on its website. "It is the liar who
must apologize, not the one who identifies the liar!"
Who are the SCV? A once-proud organization of Confederate history buffs and re-
enactors who spent their organization's money to restore Civil War-era battlefields
and Confederate cemeteries, by 2006 the SCV was substantially <a
href=http ://www. sp lcenter. org/inte l/intelreport/artic le .j sp?pid=1027 >taken
over</a> by an organized cadre of white supremacist radicals (read <a

more background) who sought to turn the nation's oldest Southern historical society
into what the veteran white supremacist activist Kirk Lyons called "a modern, 21st
century Christian war machine capable of uniting the Confederate community and
leading it to ultimate victory." When the racist junta had seized much of the SCV's
leadership positions, the Southern Poverty Law Center released an <a
href=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?sid=90 >extensive
list</a> of SCV officials who belonged to "hate groups."
Lyons, a key leader of the white supremacists who took over the SCV, had <a
href=hftp://www.thenation.com/doc/20050829/blumenthal/single >harbored
dreams</a> of creating a seemingly benign front group for a more sophisticated
version of the Ku Klux Klan. "I have great respect for the Klan historically, but,
sadly the Klan today is ineffective and sometimes even destructive," Lyons told a
German neo-Nazi magazine in 1992. "It would be good if the Klan followed the
advice of former Klansman Robert Miles: 'Become invisible. Hang the robes and
hoods in the cupboard and become an underground org anization.'" With the SCV,
Lyons discovered he didn't have to go underground after all.
Once Lyons helped install his close friend, Ron Wilson, as president of the SCV,
the organization's political newsletter, <a href=http://fpacscv.org/southernmercury/
>The Southern Mercury</a> (where Wilson served as senior editor), transformed
into a propaganda mill for crude white supremacist cant. Mailed to all dues-paying
members of the SCV — presumably including Rep. Joe Wilson — until it went
defunct in 2008, the Mercury has published articles describing blacks as genetically
inferior to whites, calling African-Americans as "a childlike people," and warned
that if Obama runs for re-election, race riots of an "exceedingly violent nature"
would immediately ensure, leaving "entire sections of some of our cities in ruins."
Here are a few highlights from the Southern Mercury:
"After the turn of the 20th century, the white Southerners had disfranchised and segregated
the blacks, in perhaps the mildest reaction possible at=2 Othat time to the blacks' transgressions.
The blacks — then a childlike people — had been selling their votes to the Democrats en masse for
$.25 apiece in national elections."

"Previously, anthropologists had routinely recorded the notable differences in IQ among
the races; but at Columbia, a liberal cultural anthropologist named Franz Boas...decreed that
there were no differences in IQ among the races, and the only biological differences between the
blacks and whites were of superficial nature... Meanwhile, the liberals in the media heaped
special praise upon black athletes, musicians, singers, and writers — and treated them as typical
of the black race. The liberals were creating a false image of the blacks in America as a highly
competent people who were being held back by the prejudiced white Southerners."
--Conner, September/October 2003
"It is very clear to me that if Barack Obama should be elected President, he would be
extremely anti-white and would demand reparations for slavery and press hard for affirmative
action to the degree that it would hurt young whites who were seeking jobs or admission to
College and Graduate Schools."
--"Americans Face The Worst Presidential Candidates In History," by Robert Slimp, Southern
Mercury, May/June 2008
"I believe that [Obama's] rhetoric and anti-white legislative proposals would stir up racial
riots. If he were running for re-election, these riots would turn into an exceedingly violent nature
that would seriously damage race relations in America, and leave entire sections of some of our
cities in ruins."
--Slimp, May/June 2008
Rep. Joe Wilson could have resigned from the SCV as soon as the organization's
takeover by open white supremacists began. But he didn't. Or he could have
withdrawn his membership when the SCV's flagship journal turned into a racist rag.
But he didn't. Instead, while serving as a state senator, Wilson led an SCV-inspired
campaign in 2000 to keep the Confederate flag flying above South Carolina's state
capitol. "The Southern heritage, the Confederate heritage, is very honorable,"
Wilson <a href=http ://news. bbc . co .uk/2/hi/americas/503579.stm>proclaimed</a> at
the time, responding to critics of the Confederate flag.
Wilson's rebel yell at Obama has electrified the Republican grassroots, filling his
campaign coffers with donations <a

the country and earning the undistinguished, previously unknown backbencher
primetime appearances on right-wing talk shows. Wilson has become the new voice
of the Republican opposition, reigniting the Lost Cause as a raucous crusade to
sabotage healthcare reform.

Chinese New Year
By PAUL KRUGMAN
It's the season when pundits traditionally make predictions about the year ahead. Mine concerns international economics:
I predict that 2010 will be the year of China. And not in a good way.
Actually, the biggest problems with China involve climate change. But today I want to focus on currency policy.
China has become a major financial and trade power. But it doesn't act like other big economies. Instead, it follows a
mercantilist policy, keeping its trade surplus artificially high. And in today's depressed world, that policy is, to put it bluntly,
predatory.
Here's how it works: Unlike the dollar, the euro or the yen, whose values fluctuate freely, China's currency is pegged by
official policy at about 6.8 yuan to the dollar. At this exchange rate, Chinese manufacturing has a large cost advantage
over its rivals, leading to huge trade surpluses.
Under normal circumstances, the inflow of dollars from those surpluses would push up the value of China's currency,
unless it was offset by private investors heading the other way. And private investors are trying to get into China, not out
of it. But China's government restricts capital inflows, even as it buys up dollars and parks them abroad, adding to a $2
trillion-plus hoard of foreign exchange reserves.
This policy is good for China's export-oriented state-industrial complex, not so good for Chinese consumers. But what
about the rest of us?
In the past, China's accumulation of foreign reserves, many of which were invested in American bonds, was arguably
doing us a favor by keeping interest rates low — although what we did with those low interest rates was mainly to inflate a
housing bubble. But right now the world is awash in cheap money, looking for someplace to go. Short-term interest rates
are close to zero; long-term interest rates are higher, but only because investors expect the zero-rate policy to end some
day. China's bond purchases make little or no difference.
Meanwhile, that trade surplus drains much-needed demand away from a depressed world economy. My back-of-the-
envelope calculations suggest that for the next couple of years Chinese mercantilism may end up reducing U.S.
employment by around 1.4 million jobs.
The Chinese refuse to acknowledge the problem. Recently Wen Jiabao, the prime minister, dismissed foreign complaints:
"On one hand, you are asking for the yuan to appreciate, and on the other hand, you are taking all kinds of protectionist
measures." Indeed: other countries are taking (modest) protectionist measures precisely because China refuses to let its
currency rise. And more such measures are entirely appropriate.
Or are they? I usually hear two reasons for not confronting China over its policies. Neither holds water.
First, there's the claim that we can't confront the Chinese because they would wreak havoc with the U.S. economy by
dumping their hoard of dollars. This is all wrong, and not just because in so doing the Chinese would inflict large losses on
themselves. The larger point is that the same forces that make Chinese mercantilism so damaging right now also mean
that China has little or no financial leverage.
Again, right now the world is awash in cheap money. So if China were to start selling dollars, there's no reason to think it
would significantly raise U.S. interest rates. It would probably weaken the dollar against other currencies — but that would
be good, not bad, for U.S. competitiveness and employment. So if the Chinese do dump dollars, we should send them a
thank-you note.

Second, there's the claim that protectionism is always a bad thing, in any circumstances. If that's what you believe,
however, you learned Econ 101 from the wrong people — because when unemployment is high and the government can't
restore full employment, the usual rules don't apply.
Let me quote from a classic paper by the late Paul Samuelson, who more or less created modern economics: "With
employment less than full ... all the debunked mercantilistic arguments" — that is, claims that nations who subsidize their
exports effectively steal jobs from other countries — "turn out to be valid." He then went on to argue that persistently
misaligned exchange rates create "genuine problems for free-trade apologetics." The best answer to these problems is
getting exchange rates back to where they ought to be. But that's exactly what China is refusing to let happen.
The bottom line is that Chinese mercantilism is a growing problem, and the victims of that mercantilism have little to lose
from a trade confrontation. So I'd urge China's government to reconsider its stubbornness. Otherwise, the very mild
protectionism it's currently complaining about will be the start of something much bigger.
Thx for sending the emails about the Nigerian. We are working on all of the
issues raised.
I hope you, Jackie and the boys (men??) have a happy, healthy, prosperous 2010.
I will look forward to seeing more of you in the upcoming months.

Re: The Berlusconi assault
The physical attack on Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is a major political event in Italy and
Europe. His assailant is a mentally disturbed man without a political agenda who has been in and out of
psychiatric care since he was 18 years old. Nonetheless, the assault has significant repercussions. It has
generated sympathy for Berlusconi as a victim—he has been obviously injured, lost two teeth and a pint
of blood, and doctors will keep him in the hospital for perhaps a week for observation. The attack comes
as Berlusconi was beginning to lose political footing, having lost his legal immunity. One court inquiry
is turning up evidence of his links to the Mafia while another is examining his role in the bribery case of
British lawyer David Mills. Berlusconi's government and party have used the attack as a way to turn the
sudden sympathy for him to his advantage, claiming that his opponents have sown a climate of "hate."
Through demogogic appeals they are attempting to discredit and rebuff the legal proceedings against
him and undermine the investigative press. (Berlusconi is suing La Repu.bblica, the large independent
newspaper in Rome that has been most aggressive in digging into his affairs of all kind.)
It would seem proper and decent for the President to call Berlusconi to express his concern about his health
and wish him a speedy recovery, if he hasn't done so already. There are many reasons for Oba.ma to do
this, not least to condemn violence against a democratically elected head of state. It would be awkward
for the U.S. President not to call a Western head of state of a NATO country who has been physically
harmed. Berlusconi, for his part, would certainly make such a call public. It would therefore also be
awkward if a call were used only as an element in his sympathy campaign against the court proceedings.
If so, there is a larger message that should be communicated, perhaps by the President in his conversation,
but most importantly through a statement from the State Department, also conveyed by the U.S.
ambassador in Italy. The USG condemns any and all violence as an assault on democracy. By the same
measure, this incident involving an apparently deranged individual should not be exploited to raise

Berlusconi 'cut deal with Mafia', court told
Former hitman claims Italian PM gave 'benefits' to the Mob for political support
By Michael Day in Milan
Saturday, 5 December 2009
The Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, made a deal with the Sicilian Mafia in the early 1990s that put the
country "in the hands" of the Mob, a court in Turin was told yesterday.
G-aspare Spatuzza, a jailed Mafia hitman turned witness, told a packed and heavily guarded bunker courtroom
that his Cosa Nostra Godfather boss had cut a deal with Mr Berlusconi in 1993 that provided unspecified
"benefits" to the Mafia in exchange for political support. The media tycoon entered. politics a few months later
and won his first term as Prime Minister in 1994.
Spatuzza said his boss, Giuseppe Graviano, who was jailed over Mafia bomb attacks in Rome, Milan and
Florence, had told him that the Mob had "got everything" with the help of Mr Berlusconi, adding that Graviano
called Mr Berlusconi "the man from Channel 5", in reference to his TV network.
The damaging claims came at the appeal hearing of Marcell° Dell'Utri, a key Berlusconi associate and senator,
who is challenging his nine-year jail sentence for links with the Mafia.
Spatuzza, in prison for several murders, testified: "Graviano told me the name of Berlusconi and said that
thanks to him and the man from our home town [an apparent reference to Dell' Utri] we have the country in our
hands." •
Mr Berlusconi has denounced the claims of Spatuzza as "vile", and "unfounded and defamatory", denying ever
having links with the Mafia. The Prime Minister's spokesman said the testimony yesterday was the Mafia's
"completely logical" revenge against the Prime Minister for his "determined" fight against organised crime.
Dell'Utri told the court that neither he nor Mr Berlusconi had Mafia connections. "It's in the interest of the
Mafia to force the collapse of the Berlusconi government because this government has done the most in the
fight against organised crime," he said. Mr Berlusconi, who recently lost his legal immunity to prosecution, was
said to have been furious this week, after the parliamentary Speaker, Gianfranco Fini, the man who is supposed
to be his closest ally, had said that the Spatuzza evidence was "an atomic bomb".
Mr Fini was recorded by an unobserved microphone while talking privately at an official dinner. Rumours of
the conservative Prime Minister's links with the Mob have persisted since investigators learnt that a Cosa Nostra
hitman, Vittorio Mangano, worked as Mr Berlusconi's "stable-master" at the media mogul's villa in Arcore
outside Milan in the 1970s. Much speculation has also centred on the origins of Mr Berlusconi's vast wealth.
Last week, the Prime Minister's broadcast group, Mediaset, and his holding company, Fininvest, announced it
intended to sue the left-wing newspaper La Repubblica over an article that said Mediaset was "20 per cent
owned by the Mafia".
La Stampa newspaper noted that the "dread combination of Mafia allegations and separation from his wife are
now his principal torments". Mr Berlusconi's estranged wife, Veronica Lario, is said to be seeking a f3m-a-
month divorce settlement, and a messy courtroom battle looms. Mr Berlusconi also faces a retrial on the charge
that he bribed the British lawyer David Mills to lie in court.

After a Court Ruling, Berlusconi's Legal Woes
Resume
By Jeff Israely
The world has spent the past six months wondering how — and with whom -- Silvio Berlusconi spends his
Saturday nights. But the combative, scandal-plagued Prime Minister of Italy would prefer to talk about his
mornings instead. "Do you know how I've been forced to spend my Saturday mornings since I entered politics?"
Berlusconi once declared to business leaders in Rome. "With my lawyers."
Italy's self-proclaimed Defendant in Chief makes a. point of lamenting all those weekends spoiled by stacks of
court dossiers. as further proof that he is the victim of politically motivated magistrates, whom he called during
the same speech "the spreading cancer of our democracy." LSee Berlusconi's worst vaffes.).
To combat such perceived persecution, Berlusconi has tested the bounds of decorous democratic conduct,
including his allies' pushing a bill through Parliament last year that gave him and other top Italian officeholders
immunity from prosecution. But since the Constitutional Court overturned that law in October, several criminal
investigations into Berlusconi's business dealings have been reopened, with other new charges rumored to be
looming.
The potentially most damaging trial is set to resume Friday, Dec. 4, in Milan, with the 73-year-old billionaire
being accused of paying British attorney David Mills $600,000 in 1997 to withhold incriminating evidence
about his broadcasting empire Mediaset. Mills is appealing a conviction in the same case; both men have denied
any wrongdoing.
So, alas, Berlusconi is back to spending his downtime with a well-paid cadre of more than a dozen avvocati,
who have been successful so far in keeping their biggest client clear of criminal convictions. Not that the
lawyers have ever really gone away. Since the media baron first ran for office 15 years ago, his legal advisers
have doubled as political consiglieri, key members of Parliament and even important Cabinet Ministers. Indeed,
while some critics have spoken of Berlusconi's reign as a kind of sultanate of showgirls or government by gaffe,
others have described it as a republic of attorneys. (See what Beriusconi's Obama "jok.es" sqy about Italy.)
His longtime lawyer Cesare Previti served as Italian Defense Minister during Beriusconi's first term in 1994
before being convicted of corruption himself (and losing twice on appeal). During Berlusconi's second term
(2001-06), Gaetano Pecorella, a former leftist, served as president of Parliament's Justice Commission, where
he was instrumental in shepherding through new laws that helped shield Berlusconi from investigating
magistrates.
Giovanni Sartori, a Columbia University professor of constitutional law, says the role Berlusconi's personal
lawyers have played in his legislative agenda is yet another gargantuan conflict of interest to add to those
related to his ownership of Italy's main private television stations. But by now, Sartori says, Berlusconi's
lawyers have perfected the art of exploiting Italy's painfully slow justice system: many cases conclude without a
final verdict because the statute of limitations has been reached. "It is more a mania than a necessity," Sartori
says of Berlusconi's near obsession in battling magistrates. "He feels persecuted, and fighting the judges is what
makes him happy."
Berlusconi's current point man is Nicol° Ghedini, a somber-faced, lanky 49-year-old criminal-defense attorney
from the northern city of Padua, who has served in both the Italian Senate and the lower house of Parliament.
Ghedini has continued to mount a grinding defense in the criminal cases, arguing in the Mills case that
Berlusconi cannot be present in the Milan courtroom for the next several months because of time conflicts with
his duties as Prime Minister. Ghedini has also spearheaded an increasingly aggressive legal strategy that has
included several libel suits against opposition newspapers. He declared in September that if necessary,
Berlusconi would testify in a suit against a journalist who referred to rumors that the Prime Minister is
impotent. Last week, Berlusconi vowed to launch additional suits against newspapers that printed
unsubstantiated reports that a close adviser of his was involved in a 1993 bombing campaign by the Sicilian
Mafia. (Read "An Offended Berlusconi Goes on the Offensive.")
Despite these many legal headaches, 'Berlusconi is embroiled in one other particularly thorny case that even he
can't blame on overzealous magistrates. Veronica Lario, Berlusconi's wife of more than. 20 years, filed for
divorce earlier this year, which sparked an avalanche of accusations that he frequented a prostitute from Bari

and an underage model from Naples. The Milan daily Corriere della Sera reported last week that Lario has
demanded 3.5 million euros ($5.2 million) in monthly payments, and Berlusconi countered with an offer of
300,000 euros ($450,000). No matter how this and the other cases shake out, there is little hope that Berlusconi
can avoid a mountain of lawyers' fees and some grim Saturdays that he'd rather devote to other business and
pleasures.

3) What idea do you see fading and/or emerging in 2010 and beyond?
• Sidney Blumenthal
The greatest challenge for the early 21st century is that China's leadership has contempt for much of the international
order and many of the international organisations developed since the second world war. In pursuit of its narrow and even
crude understanding of its interest, China will constantly abuse and break international rules, protocols and bodies. Its
willful destruction of the Copenhagen summit on climate change reveals the pattern. Its mercantile currency policy in a
beggar-thy-neighbour approach, environmental degradation, and disdain for human rights and the rule of law generally
are the obvious reflections of its despotism. Through its rough and strange neo-imperialism, in Africa especially but also
elsewhere, China is able to gain help, partly through economic intimidation, in its international forays to repel or strike
down the responsibilities of internationalism.
Internally, China is a prison of nations, an empire similar to imperial Russia and the Soviet Union, and may also be the
most unequal industrial country in distribution of income. China's power is increasing, but the authoritarian regime is
hardly the wave of the future as some awestruck worshippers of raw power and money (whether investment bankers or
ex-Marxists) imagine. The system is inherently unstable, which accounts for its rigid currency policy (at root a fear of
operating on other than a virtual slave-labour standard, of turning its poverty-stricken millions into consumers with real
choice, and ultimately of letting go even a little bit).
In the long-term the tyranny of the one-party state and its military rule is at odds with the new economic classes of
entrepreneurs and professionals it has fostered. China's growing economic power is accompanied by expanding
arrogance, demonstrated not least in the incivility and rudeness with which President Obama was treated on his trip there.
China's regime lacks an ideal other than a communist gloss on Confucian uniformity, itself based incoherently on reckless
economic development, for example in the areas of currency, environment and labour; it has no "soft power", not just
because of the coarseness of its supposed diplomacy, but also because its cultural appeal does not travel. China forces
its way through coercion of one sort or another.
The next decade will see how flexible or inflexible its rulers are and how secure their system is. The brief effort at a
rhetorical gesture by some in the Obama administration who floated the turgid phrase "strategic reassurance" was risible
and did not last. For now, the west has no policy to deal with China as it is. The place to begin is on currency.
The most powerful idea for the 21st century is the equality of women. It is the idea most feared by those - from the Vatican
to the Taliban - arrayed against modernity, the still vibrant project of the Enlightenment. Someday the United States may
even have a woman president. It took fifty years after granting the vote to African-Americans to pass a constitutional
amendment giving it to women. Perhaps the distance between electing the first African-American president and the first
female one will not be so great.

Re: Afghan/Western Alliance/UK
Happy Thanksgiving!
On the eve of the president's announcement on Afghanistan the Western alliance is near-broken. The
obvious: Your trip to NATO will be the final call on Afghanistan. Whatever you scrap together there
will be the remains of the day. There will be no more. The spare change in troops you pick up will be the
close-out deal. The Europeans will be less amenable to contributions in the future than the House
Democratic Caucus.
Consensus across the board in Britain—center, right, left--is that the Atlantic alliance--th.e special
relationship--the historic bond since World War II—is shattered. There is no dissenting voice, not one,
and there are no illusions. Opinion is unanimous. The bottom line is that the Obama administration's
denigration of the U.K is seen as the summation of the Bush era. Undoubtedly, you saw this week
Minister of Defense Bob Ainsworth's public criticism of Oba.ma's indecision and his accusation that the
president is indifferent and damaging to British interest. While Downing Street sought to ameliorate his
remarks with an oleaginous statement his view is simply what everyone—everyone—thinks. His clumsy
outburst was a classic gaffe--an embarrassing mistake because it reveals something true. The Chilcot
inquiry of Parliament, publicly conducting hearings on the origins of UK involvement in the Iraq
invasion, has put Bush's war on terror--and British involvement—on trial--and the calmly conducted
but eviscerating hearings will go on for another year. Blair is seen as either complicit on the basis of
knowing there was no casus belli or as an enthusiastically deceived tool. Nick Clegg, leader of the
Liberal Democrats, has stated that the reason support for the Afghanistan mission has cratered is because
of the lies told in the run-up to the Iraq war--another view universally held. Meanwhile, former UK
ambassador to the US Christopher Meyer has published his new book on the history of UK diplomacy
with concluding sections on the demise of the special relationship. He is not only being interviewed on
all British media but also has appeared as a voluble witness before the Chilcot commission. (I've
included a report below.) All British newspapers and journals have prominently published many pieces
within the last week on the decline and fall of the US-UK relationship. (I've included below the lead

editorial today from the London Times and the cover story from the Spectator--two of the most
resolutely pro-American sources.) The tone is not resentful, but reserved, disdainful and superior. The
US administration is considered blinkered, parochial and counter-productive. Conservatives are more
contemptuous than Labour, which feels abandoned and somewhat baffled. Rather than eager to be
Obama's poodle, Cameron would be superficially friendly and privately scornful. Class has a lot to do
with the contempt. A CamerOn government would be more aristocratic and even narrowly Etonian than
any Conservative government in recent history, sharply contrasting especially with the striving and
classless perspective of the grocer's daughter, Margaret Thatcher. And yet, and yet, the most recent poll
this week showed Labour within striking distance of the Tories, about five points down, the result of a
slight economic uptick. A hung parliament seems very possible. Given the distribution of voting
patterns, Labour need not win a plurality to have more seats than the Tories. The slight buoyancy for
Labour in this unique situation has only heightened anxiety about Obama's Afghanistan process, which
has excluded the British government from significant consultation and consideration of its interests. (See
the lead to Con Coughlin's Spectator piece.) Therefore, you might contemplate a brief trip to London
and public appearance with Brown on your way back from Brussels.
On the Western alliance, beyond its military part, NATO, there is much more to say and develop, but later.
Read three pieces below:
From The Times
November 26, 2009
Atlantic drift
Washington's delay in announcing its Afghanistan strategy has left
Brown drifting. Obama needs to invest more time and attention in the
transatlantic alliance
President Obama declared on Tuesday that "the whole world" had a responsibility to help the US-led mission in
Afghanistan. He would, he said, soon lay out the "obligations of our international partners". Those partners
have been waiting a long time for the details. On Monday the President had his tenth meeting with his advisers
to work out his strategy for Afghanistan. He has now spent almost three months considering his options, and has
promised an announcement on deployments after the Thanksgiving holiday.
For Gordon Brown, this cannot come too soon. After the United States, Britain is the largest contributor of
troops to the Nato operation in Afghanistan. There has never been any suggestion that Britain has enough
soldiers to pursue a separate strategy or that it can operate independently of the US forces, which already
number some 68,000 troops. Until the White House decides whether to send an extra 40,000 or some figure
significantly lower than the number requested by General Stanley McChrystal, Mr Brown cannot properly plan
the best support strategy.
it is becoming sadly apparent that Britain has been left drifting by the delays in Washington, and that the
Obama Administration is largely unaware of the embarrassment this is causing the Government. More
worryingly, this does not seem to be a source of concern within the Administration. Downing Street,
diplomatically, turns aside any suggestion that it is frustrated by the nonchalance with which it is being treated.
But the insistent questions on Afghanistan, the anger caused by the steady stream of returning war dead and the
rapid crumbling of public support for the war cannot be answered effectively until Mr Brown is taken into
American confidence and seen as a full partner in the Nato campaign.
On the surface, the continuing high regard in Britain for the dynamic and articulate new President has masked
these growling complaints. Mr Brown is not suffering, as his predecessor did, from the taint of close association
with a deeply unpopular US president. On the contrary: like several European leaders, he is still eager to
position himself as close as possible to Mr Obama to clothe himself in some of the President's European
popularity. But within Government. there is already worry that Britain's voice counts far less than it did in the
past. This is not simply another instance of the persistent but pointless British anxiety over the so-called special

relationship; it is a justified concern that two of the main pillars of the Nato alliance should have policies and
strategies that are closely co-ordinated and sympathetically understood on both sides when fighting a war.
The fault, glaringly, is on the American side. The White House no longer seems to be monitoring the reactions
and political options of its transatlantic allies. It is not sufficient to suggest that the Administration sees little
point in investing time and diplomacy in a British government likely to be defeated in the coming general
election; wartime allies have interests that go far beyond the political make-up of the government of the day. Mr
Obama promised during his election campaign to revive trust in American leadership and to re-engage in
multinational diplomacy. In office, he has certainly voiced the same ideals; but he has invested little in giving
new substance and dynamism to the transatlantic relationship.
On Afghanistan, Mr Brown has sometimes been left speechless by Washington. He talks of sending 500 extra
troops. But until he knows the likely US strategy, he cannot outline his own. Atlanticism is always fragile on the
Left and was stretched to breaking point by Tony Blair. It is now being undermined by indifference in
Washington. Today America is enjoying Thanksgiving. Tomorrow it must look out again to its all

It says much about Britain's rapidly disappearing 'special relationship' with America that when I happened

to grieving mothers to demanding that an exit strategy be established for the withdrawal of British
forces. Yet among our top brass, the general perception is that the Prime Minister has little interest in the
war.
It is often as if Brown regards the Afghan campaign as a dead fish that Tony Blair has left in the top drawer
of his Downing Street desk. It has infected his premiership with a foul odour, and he wants to be rid of it
as soon as possible. This explains his promise, on Monday, to set a timetable for the withdrawal of
British troops at the earliest available opportunity. The signal is sent that an exit is not just in sight, but
being approached.
Brown's approach hardly squares with his Foreign Secretary's assertion, made the next day in his address to
Nato's Parliamentary Assembly, that British forces should remain until the Afghans are strong enough
to take care of their own affairs. Miliband might have his faults, such as his obsessive enthusiasm for
Europe. But he is sound on Afghanistan where — unlike the prime minister — he has been an articulate .
and well-informed advocate of the Nato cause. One has the feeling that, if Mr Obama were able to talk
about Afghanistan, Mr Miliband could have a decent conversation with him.
But the very fact that these policy divisions are now starting to appear in London is symptomatic of a far
deeper malaise that lies at the heart of Afghan policy-making; it is a malaise that now threatens to
jeopardise the success of the entire mission. And this malaise is the absence of meaningful dialogue
between the White House and its hitherto most stalwart and reliable ally, particularly when it comes to
the messy business of confronting Islamist militants through force of arms.
We all had a good giggle when Brown was reduced to chasing the Leader of the Free World through the
subterranean kitchen complex at the UN's New York headquarters in September. One can understand
why Obama can think of a million better ways to spend his time than talking to our obsessive, nail-

chewing and electorally doomed prime minister. But given that Britain and America are currently
fighting a war together, one would hope that the true statesman would overcome any personal
reservations — and deal with Mr Brown because of the country he represents.
What really troubles British policymakers is that the collapse in the relationship is institutional, not
personal, and that the president has little interest in listening to what Britain has to say on many world
issues, even at a time when British servicemen and women are sacrificing their lives in what is supposed
to be a common cause.
The astonishing disregard with which Mr Obama treats Britain has been made clear by his deliberations
over the Afghan issue. As he decides how many more troops to send to Afghanistan — a decision which
will fundamentally affect the scope of the mission — Britain is reduced to guesswork. The White .House
does not even pretend to portray this as a joint decision. It is a diplomatic cold-shouldering that stands in
contrast not just to the Blair–Bush era, but to the togetherness of the soldiers on the ground.
One of the enduring cornerstones of the transatlantic alliance is the deep bond that exists between the British
and American armed forces. The strength of the American military might be many times that available
to Britain but, as any senior officer will tell you, on either side of the Atlantic, they are so close as to be
joined at the hip. From the moment they sign up, young American and British officers train together,
socialise together and — since 9/11 — have fought and died together.
The relaxed familiarity between the two martial traditions was reflected in the warmth with which General
Stanley McChrystal, the American commander of Nato forces in Afghanistan, referred during his recent
visit to London to British contemporaries such as `Jacko', General Sir Michael Jackson, former head of
the British army, and 'Lamby', Lt-Gen Sir Graeme Lamb, who is currently spending his well-earned
retirement in Kabul helping to devise a new counter-insurgency strategy to defeat the Taleban. So far as
Afghanistan is concerned, it would be fair to say that American and British military commanders are
singing from the same Afghan prayer mat.
Indeed, there was no shortage of enthusiasm on the part of the British military, or any of the other Whitehall
departments involved in the Afghan campaign, to support Obama when he announced last March a new
counter-insurgency strategy based on an Iraq-like military 'surge'. McChrystal was personally appointed
by Obama to make the policy a success, and General Sir David Richards, himself a former commander
of Nato forces in Afghanistan, was one of a number of senior army officers who quickly got behind the
new initiative. So, too, did the redoubtable Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles, our former ambassador to Kabul,
who drafted numerous briefing documents making the case for greater co-operation and cohesion within
Whitehall, and the development of a comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy that encompassed all the
participants, and not just the military.
So where are they now, all these bright initiatives? Why is it that the Foreign Office and our senior military
commanders are as much in the dark as anyone else as to what the strategy for Afghanistan is to be? We
don't know, because Mr Obama is too busy cosying up to his new chums in Moscow and Beijing to tell
us. And as we stumble around in the policy darkness, there is the inevitable tendency to make it up as we
go along. Hence the conflicting policy edicts issued this week by Messrs Brown and Miliband.
The trouble started in the summer, when Obama appears to have had a change of heart and, rather than
proceeding with the Afghan strategy he announced in March, decided to undertake a review of it instead.
And in the process of so doing he has provided us with a telling insight into how we can expect the
Obama presidency to function in future.
Much of the criticism, at home and abroad, concerning the Afghan policy review has tended to focus on
accusations of White House dithering which, after nearly three and a half months, is not entirely without
foundation. But what should be far more worrying for all those countries, such as Britain, that had
looked forward to co-operating with Obama's apparent desire to reach out and engage with America's
allies is the exclusivity of his style of decision-making — if you can call it that.
As General McChrystal has found to his cost, Obama and his inner circle of Chicago pots do not take kindly
to being second-guessed by those whose advice they seek, but have every right to reject. There is no
reason to doubt McChrystai's gloomy prediction — which is generally endorsed by Whitehall -- that
without an extra 40,000 Nato troops the Afghan mission is doomed to failure. But talk to any Obama
aide these days and they will tell you that, fine soldier though he undoubtedly is, McChrystal is

politically naive, spoke out of turn and now thoroughly regrets the day he ever set foot in a London think
tank, where he stated his case too explicitly for the White .HOuse's liking. One recent two-hour Afghan
strategy meeting spent 24 minutes discussing whether McChrystal was the right man for the job after all.
In other words, to use the phrase- ology popular in Chicago, he's dead meat.
Obama, meanwhile, has made his own deliberations so secretive that only about three people in the whole of
Washington — and, ergo, the rest of the world — know precisely what he has in mind, and none of them
is talking. Even President George W. Bush, who was frequently criticised for his arroaance and
unilateralism, was better than this. From 9/11 until the Iraq war, he kept Tony Blair and other trusted
allies (there weren't that many, let's face it) fully briefed on what he was planning — so much so that
Blair is now accused of colluding with him to invade Iraq from the spring of 2002.
But with Obama there are no regular video-conferences bringing Downing Street up to date on the latest
White House thinking. No special envoys making secret visits to London to keep the key players
informed. Instead we will have to wait, like everyone else, for the puffs of smoke from the White House
— which are now expected around the Thanksgiving holiday — to find out what Obama really intends
to do about Afghanistan. He is, in all too many ways, an AWOL ally.
Nor is it just on Afghanistan that we can discern a high-handed approach from the American president. Did
Obama bother to consult Britain before cancelling the missile shield system for Eastern Europe (the
early-warning detection system is, after all, based at RAF Fylingdales on the North Yorkshire Moors)?
No he did not. The Poles, who are rightly sensitive about their security being used as a bargaining chip
in negotiations with their super-power neighbours, had to make do with a late-night call from Hillary
Clinton on the eve of the announcement — the Poles understandably turned down the call, a breach of
both manners and protocol. In his keenness to befriend Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, had Obama
taken any account of the widespread European unease concerning the mood of resurgent nationalism
sweeping Moscow? Not a chance.
And to judge from his recent peregrinations around the Far East, it seems Obama is far more interested in
making new friends than taking the trouble to keep up with old acquaintances. The enthusiasm he
displayed when he bumped into Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's Prime Minister, during this week's Apec
summit in Singapore was considerably greater than he has shown for Many of his European allies. Not
for Medvedev the indignity of conducting important bilateral discussions in kitchens surrounded by vats
of boiling noodles.. And in Beijing Obama spent a convivial evening with President Hu Jintao,
discussing the evolution and histories of China and America. Being an. American ally has never seemed
so unrewarding.
There will, though, inevitably come a time when Obama discovers who America's true friends really are.
Sooner or later he will have to deal with the considerably more taxing issues of Islamist militancy, rogue
nuclear states and other tangible threats to the West's security, At that point, Obama will discover a
simple but essential truth. The world divides between those who support American values of freedom
and democracy, and those who seek to destroy them.
Few nations have been more committed to supporting those values with both blood and treasure than
Britain. This country, and especially those British troops fighting alongside their American counterparts,
deserve far better than this president's disregard.

Irai war build-up 'left us scrabbling for smoking

Sir Christopher Meyer says plans to invade Iraq did not give time for weapons inspectors
James itteleikle and Andrew Sparrow
guardiarLeo.uk, Thursday 26 November 2009 12.57 GMT
The military timetable for an invasion of lr.
,aq in 2003 did not give time for UN weapons inspectors in the country to do their
job, the former British ambassador to Washington told the Iraq inquiry in London today.
Sir Christopher Meyer said the "unforgiving nature" of the build-up after American forces had been told to prepare for war
meant that "we found ourselves scrabbling for the smoking gun".
He added: "It was another way of saying 'it's not that Saddam has to prove that he's innocent, we've now bloody well got
to try and prove he's guilty.' And we — the Americans, the British — have never really recovered from that because of
course there was no smoking gun."
The US had first prepared for invasion in January but the date was later moved to March. "All that said, when you looked
at the timetable for the inspections, it was impossible to see how [Hans] Blix [chief weapons inspector] could bring the
process to a conclusion, for better or for worse, by March."
Meyer said he had been in favour of removing Saddam, He thought you did not need 9/11 or weapons of mass
destruction to justify confronting Iraq. Saddam had not lived up to the commitments given after the first Gulf war. He had
"the means and the will" to build weapons even if he hid not have them at the time.
Meyer said he did not know what made the UK fix "on a very large land force by our standards". He believed it would not
have damaged Britain's standing in the US to have sent fewer troops to Iraq, but actively opposing the war would have
done.
Earlier Meyer said George Bush's administration was seen by many as "running out of steam" on the eve of the "great
atrocity" of the 9/11 attacks on the US.
It looked like an administration that had run into trouble very quickly, the former ambassador to Washington said. People
were saying the effort of getting big tax cuts and medical prescription benefits for older people through Congress had
"killed" Bush, Meyer said. He added that secretary of state Colin Powell's efforts to narrow and deepen sanctions against
Iraq had failed and there was a "huge bear market" against Donald Rumsfeld, the defence secretary.
Meyer said attitudes towards Iraq were influenced to an extent not appreciated by him at the time by the ant-ex qcare
tng .3pon 1. US senators and others were sent anthrax spores in the post, a crime that led to the death of five
people, prompting policymakers to claim links to Saddam Hussein.
Meyer told the third day of Sir John ChiIcot's hearings that from the onset of the Bush presidency in 2001, there was
enthusiasm on the Republican right for arming and supporting Iraqi dissidents, "mostly in London", particularly the Iraqi
National Congress led by Ahmed Chalabi.
Powell was sceptical of such "belligerent" moves, concentrating on sanctions with Robin Cook, the then-British foreign
secretary, with whom. Meyer said, "somewhat to my surprise", he got on well.
On 9/11 Condoleezza Rice, then the US national security adviser, told Meyer she was in "no doubt: it was an ai-Qaida
operation". The following weekend Bush and his key advisers met at Camp David and contacts later told Meyer there had
been a "big ding-dong" about Iraq and Saddam.
It seemed that Paul VVolfowitz, Rumsfe|d'o deputy, argued for retaliation to include Iraq. Meyer said. It was not clear where
Rumsfeld stood. But later that month Bush and Tony Blair, on a visit to Washington, were agreed on a "laser-like focus"
on al-Qaida and Pakistan.
Blair's reputation had soared "above all others" because of his support for the US, the former ambassador told the inquiry.
But the anthrax scare had "steamed up" policy makers in Bush's administration and helped swing attitudes against
Saddam, who the administration believed had been the last person to use anthrax.
Rice fell more and more "in the camp of Powell's enemies". There Was a "sea change" in attitudes to containment but the
UK still had "a legal problem" with regime change. Meyer told British officials to argue that the alliance would be in better
shape if there was international support for military action. There was no need to argue that with the state department. But
there was with Dick Cheney, the vice-president, and Rumsfeld.
Asked about Blair's meeting with Bush at Crawford, Texas, in April 2002, where, some observers believe, the decision to
go to war was made, Meyer said: "To this day I'm not entirely clear what degree of convergence was signed in blood at
the Texas range."
But a speech by Blair the following day was, he believed, the first time the prime minister had publicaly said "regime
change". "What he was trying to do was to draw the lessons of 9/11 and aPply them to the situation in Iraq, which led — I
think not inadvertently but deliberately — to a conflation of the threat posed by Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein.
"When I heard that speech, I thought that this represents a tightening of the UIQUS alliance and a degree of convergence
on the danger Saddam Hussein presented."

Re: Afghan/Western Alliance/UK
1. Happy Thanksgiving!
2. On the eve of the president's announcement on Afghanistan the Western
alliance is near-broken. The obvious: Your trip to NATO will be the final call
on Afghanistan. Whatever you scrap together there will be the remains of the
day. There will be no more. The spare change in troops you pick up will be the
close-out deal. The Europeans will be less amenable to contributions in the
future than the House Democratic Caucus.
3. Consensus across the board in Britain—center, right, left—is that the
Atlantic alliance--the special relationship—the historic bond since World War
II—is shattered. There is no dissenting voice, not one, and there are no
illusions. Opinion is unanimous. The bottom line is that the Obama
administration's denigration of the UK is seen as the summation of the Bush era.
Undoubtedly, you saw this week Minister of Defense Bob Ainsworth's public
criticism of Obama's indecision and his accusation that the president is
indifferent and damaging to British interest. While Downing Street sought to
ameliorate his remarks with an oleaginous statement his view is simply what
evervone—evervone—thinks. His clumsy outburst was a classic gaffe—an
embarrassing mistake because it reveals something true. The Chilcot inquiry of
Parliament, publicly conducting hearings on the origins of UK involvement in the
Iraq invasion, has put Bush's war on terror—and British involvement—on trial—and
the calmly conducted but eviscerating hearings will go on for another year.
Blair is seen as either complicit on the basis of knowing there was no casus
belli or as an enthusiastically deceived tool. Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal
Democrats, has stated that the reason support for the Afghanistan mission has
cratered is because of the lies told in the run-up to the Iraq war—another view
universally held. Meanwhile, former UK ambassador to the US Christopher Meyer

has published his new book on the history of UK diplomacy with concluding
sections on the demise of the special relationship. He is not only being
interviewed on all British media but also has appeared as a voluble witness
before the Chilcot commission. (I've included a report below.) All British
newspapers and journals have prominently published many pieces within the last
week on the decline and fall of the US-UK relationship. (I've included below the
lead editorial today from the London Times and the cover story from the
Spectator—two of the most resolutely pro-American sources.) The tone is not
resentful, but reserved, disdainful and superior. The US administration is
considered blinkered, parochial and counter-productive. Conservatives are more
contemptuous than Labour, which feels abandoned and somewhat baffled. Rather
than eager to be Obama's poodle, Cameron would be superficially friendly and
privately scornful. Class has a lot to do with the contempt. A Cameron
government would be more aristocratic and even narrowly Etonian than any
Conservative government in recent history, sharply contrasting especially with
the striving and classless perspective of the grocer's daughter, Margaret
Thatcher. And yet, and yet, the most recent poll this week showed Labour within
striking distance of the Tories, about five points down, the result of a slight
economic uptick. A hung parliament seems very possible. Given the distribution
of voting patterns, Labour need not win a plurality to have more seats than the
Tories. The slight buoyancy for Labour in this unique situation has only
heightened anxiety about Obama's Afghanistan process, which has excluded the
British government from significant consultation and consideration of its
interests. (See the lead to Con Coughlin's Spectator piece.) Therefore, you
might contemplate a brief trip to London and public appearance with Brown on
your way back from Brussels.
4. On the Western alliance, beyond its military part, NATO, there is much
more to say and develop, but later. Read three pieces below:

Atlantic drift
Washington's delay in announcing its Afghanistan strategy has left Brown
drifting. Obama needs to invest more time and attention in the transatlantic
alliance
President Obama declared on Tuesday that "the whole world" had a responsibility
to help the US-led mission in Afghanistan. He would, he said, soon lay out the
"obligations of our international partners". Those partners have been waiting a
long time for the details. On Monday the President had his tenth meeting with
his advisers to work out his strategy for Afghanistan. He has now spent almost
three months considering his options, and has promised an announcement on
deployments after the Thanksgiving holiday.
For Gordon Brown, this cannot come too soon. After the United States, Britain is
the largest contributor of troops to the Nato operation in Afghanistan. There
has never been any suggestion that Britain has enough soldiers to pursue a
separate strategy or that it can operate independently of the US forces, which
already number some 68,000 troops. Until the White House decides whether to send
an extra 40,000 or some figure significantly lower than the number requested by
General Stanley McChrystal, Mr Brown cannot properly plan the best support
strategy.
It is becoming sadly apparent that Britain has been left drifting by the delays
in Washington, and that the Obama Administration is largely unaware of the
embarrassment this is causing the Government. More worryingly, this does not
seem to be a source of concern within the Administration. Downing Street,
diplomatically, turns aside any suggestion that it is frustrated by the
nonchalance with which it is being treated. But the insistent questions on
Afghanistan, the anger caused by the steady stream of returning war dead and the
rapid crumbling of public support for the war cannot be answered effectively
until Mr Brown is taken into American confidence and seen as a full partner in
the Nato campaign.
On the surface, the continuing high regard in Britain for the dynamic and
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766156 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766156 Date: 07/31/2015
articulate new President has masked these growling complaints. Mr Brown is not
suffering, as his predecessor did, from the taint of close association with a
deeply unpopular US president. On the contrary: like several European leaders,
he is still eager to position himself as close as possible to Mr Obama to clothe
himself in some of the President's European popularity. But within Government,
there is already worry that Britain's voice counts far less than it did in the
past. This is not simply another instance of the persistent but pointless
British anxiety over the so-called special relationship; it is a justified
concern that two of the main pillars of the Nato alliance should have policies
and strategies that are closely co-ordinated and sympathetically understood on
both sides when fighting a war.
The fault, glaringly, is on the American side. The White House no longer seems
to be monitoring the reactions and political options of its transatlantic
allies. It is not sufficient to suggest that the Administration sees little
point in investing time and diplomacy in a British government likely to be
defeated in the coming general election; wartime allies have interests that go
far beyond the political make-up of the government of the day. Mr Obama promised
during his election campaign to revive trust in American leadership and to
re-engage in multinational diplomacy. In office, he has certainly voiced the
same ideals; but he has invested little in giving new substance and dynamism to
the transatlantic relationship.
On Afghanistan, Mr Brown has sometimes been left speechless by Washington. He
talks of sending 500 extra troops. But until he knows the likely US strategy, he
cannot outline his own. Atlanticism is always fragile on the Left and was
stretched to breaking point by Tony Blair. It is now being undermined by
indifference in Washington. Today America is enjoying Thanksgiving. Tomorrow it
must look out again to its all

Barack Obama's increasing disregard for Britain's views is no way to
treat an ally whose troops have fought side by side with America since September
11, says Con Coughlin
Washington
It says much about Britain's rapidly disappearing 'special
relationship' with America that when I happened to mention to some of our senior
military officers that I was visiting Washington, they begged me to find out
what the Obama administration was thinking about Afghanistan. it is not just
that the transatlantic lines of communication, so strong just a few years ago,
have fallen into disuse. There is now a feeling that, even if we reached the
Oval Office, there would be no one willing to take Britain's call.
For weeks now, President Obama has been deliberating over what the
Afghan strategy should be — and how many troops to send. If there is confusion
in Washington, then Britain's strategy is not much clearer. Gordon Brown has
staged a recent flurry of activity on the subject, from writing misspelt letters
to grieving mothers to demanding that an exit strategy be established for the
withdrawal cf British forces. Yet among our top brass, the general perception is
that the Prime Minister has little interest in the war.
It is often as if Brown regards the Afghan campaign as a dead. fish
that Tony Blair has left in the top drawer of his Downing Street desk. It has
infected his premiership with a foul odour, and he wants to be rid of it as soon
as possible. This explains his promise, on Monday, to set a timetable for the
withdrawal of British troops at the earliest available opportunity. The signal
is sent that an exit is not just in sight, but being approached.
Brown's approach hardly squares with his Foreign Secretary's
assertion, made the next day in his address to Nato's Parliamentary Assembly,
that British forces should remain until the Afghans are strong enough to take
care of their own affairs. Miliband might have his faults, such as his obsessive
enthusiasm for Europe. But he is sound on Afghanistan where — unlike the prime
minister — he has been an articulate and well-informed advocate of the Nato

cause. One has the feeling that, if Mr Obama were able to talk about
Afghanistan, Mr Miliband could have a decent conversation with him.
But the very fact that these policy divisions are now starting to
appear in London is symptomatic of a far deeper malaise that lies at the heart
of Afghan policy-making; it is a malaise that now threatens to jeopardise the
success of the entire mission. And this malaise is the absence of meaningful
dialogue between the White House and its hitherto most stalwart and reliable
ally, particularly when it comes to the messy business of confronting Islamist
militants through force of arms.
We all had a good giggle when Brown was reduced to chasing the Leader
of the Free World through the subterranean kitchen complex at the UN's New York
headquarters in September. One can understand why Obama can think of a million
better ways to spend his time than talking to our obsessive, nail-chewing and
electorally doomed prime minister. But given that Britain and America are
currently fighting a war together, one would hope that the true statesman would
overcome any personal reservations -- and deal with Mr Brown because of the
country he represents.
What really troubles British policymakers is that the collapse in the
relationship is institutional, not personal, and that the president has little
interest in listening to what Britain has to say on many world issues, even at a
time when British servicemen and women are sacrificing their lives in what is
supposed to be a common cause.
The astonishing disregard with which Mr Obama treats Britain has been
made clear by his deliberations over the Afghan issue. As he decides how many
more troops to send to Afghanistan — a decision which will fundamentally affect
the scope of the mission — Britain is reduced to guesswork. The White House does
not even pretend to portray this as a joint decision. It is a diplomatic
cold-shouldering that stands in contrast not just to the Blair-Bush era, but to
the togetherness of the soldiers on the ground.

deep bond that exists between the British and American armed forces. The

strength of the American military might be many times that available to Britain
but, as any senior officer will tell you, on either side of the Atlantic, they
are so close as to be joined at the hip. From the moment they sign up, young
American and British officers train together, socialise together and — since
9/11 — have fought and died together.
The relaxed familiarity between the two martial traditions was
reflected in the warmth with which General Stanley McChrystal, the American
commander• of Nato forces in Afghanistan, referred during his recent visit to
London to British contemporaries such as 'Jacko', General Sir Michael Jackson,
former head of the British army, and 'Lamby', Lt-Gen Sir Graeme Lamb, who is
currently spending his well-earned retirement in Kabul helping to devise a new
counter-insurgency strategy to defeat the Taleban. So far as Afghanistan is
concerned, it would be fair to say that American and British military commanders
are singing from the same Afghan prayer mat.
Indeed, there was no shortage of enthusiasm on the part of the British
military, or any of the other Whitehall departments involved in the Afghan
campaign, to support Obama when he announced last March a new counter-insurgency
strategy based on an Iraq-like military `surge'. McChrystal was personally
appointed by Obama to make the policy a success, and General Sir David Richards,
himself a former commander of Nato forces in Afghanistan, was one of a number of
senior army officers who Quickly got behind the new initiative. So, too, did the
redoubtable Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles, our former ambassador to Kabul, who
drafted numerous briefing documents making the case for greater co-operation and
cohesion within Whitehall, and the development of a comprehensive
counter-terrorism strategy that encompassed all the participants, and not just
the military.
So where are they now, all these bright initiatives? Why is it that
the Foreign Office and our senior military commanders are as much in the dark as
anyone else as to. what the strategy for Afghanistan is to be? We don't know,
because Mr Obama is too busy cosying up to his new chums in Moscow and Beijing
to tell us. And as we stumble around in the policy darkness, there is the

inevitable tendency to make it up as we go along. Hence the conflicting policy
edicts issued this week b✓ Messrs Brown and Miliband.
The trouble started in the summer, when Obama appears to have had a
change of heart and, rather than proceeding with the Afghan strategy he
announced in March, decided to undertake a review of it instead. And in the
process of so doing he has provided us with a telling insight into how we can
expect the Obama presidency to function in future.
Much of the criticism, at home and abroad, concerning the Afghan
policy review has tended to focus on accusations of White House dithering which,
after nearly three and a half months, is not entirely without foundation. But
what should be far more worrying for all those countries, such as Britain, that
had looked forward to co-operating with Obama's apparent desire to reach out and
engage with America's allies is the exclusivity of his style of decision-making
— if you can call it that.
As General McChrystal has found to his cost, Obama and his inner
circle of Chicago pots do not take kindly to being second-guessed by those whose
advice they seek, but have every right to reject. There is no reason to doubt
McChrystal's gloomy prediction -- which is generally endorsed by Whitehall — that
without an extra 40,000 Nato troops the Afghan mission is doomed to failure. But
talk to any Obama aide these days and they will tell you that, fine soldier
though he undoubtedly is, McChrystal is politically naive, spoke cut of turn and
now thoroughly regrets the day he ever set foot in a London think tank, where he
stated his case too explicitly for the White House's liking. One recent two-hour
Afghan strategy meeting spent 24 minutes discussing whether McChrystal was the
right man for the job after all. In other words, to use the phrase- ology
popular in Chicago, he's dead meat.
Obama, meanwhile, has made his own deliberations so secretive that
only about three people in the whole of Washington — and, ergo, the rest of the
world — know precisely what he has in mind, and none of them is talking. Even
President George W. Bush, who was frequently criticised for his arrogance and
unilateralism, was better than this. From 9/11 until the Iraq war, he kept Tony

Blair and other trusted allies (there weren't that many, let's face it) fully
briefed on what he was planning — so much so that Blair is now accused of
colluding with him to invade Iraq from the spring of 2002.
But with Obama there are no regular video-conferences bringing Downing
Street up to date on the latest White House thinking. No special envoys making
secret visits to London to keep the key players informed. Instead we will have
to wait, like everyone else, for the puffs of smoke from the White House — which
are now expected around the Thanksgiving holiday — to find out what Obama really
intends to do about Afghanistan. He is, in all too many ways; an AWOL ally.
Nor is it just on Afghanistan that we can discern a high-handed
approach from the American president. Did Obama bother to consult Britain before
cancelling the missile shield system for Eastern Europe (the early•-warning
detection system is, after all, based at RAP Fylingdales on the North Yorkshire
Moors)? No he did not. The Poles, who are rightly sensitive about their security
being used as a bargaining chip in negotiations with their super-power
neighbours, had to make do with a late-night call from Hillary Clinton on the
eve of the announcement — the Poles understandably turned down the call, a
breach of both manners and protocol. In his keenness to befriend Russian
President Dmitry Medvedev, had Obama taken any account of the widespread
European unease concerning the mood of resurgent nationalism sweeping Moscow?
Not a chance.
And to judge from his recent peregrinations around the Far East, it
seems Obama is far more interested in making new friends than taking the trouble
to keep up with old acquaintances. The enthusiasm he displayed when he bumped
into Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's Prime Minister, during this week's Apec summit in
Singapore was considerably greater than he has shown for many of his European
allies. Not for Medvedev the indignity of conducting important bilateral
discussions in kitchens surrounded by vats of boiling noodles. And in Beijing
Obama spent a convivial evening with President Hu Jintao, discussing the
evolution and histories of China and America. Being an American ally has never
seemed so unrewarding.

There will, though, inevitably come a time when Obama discovers who
America's true friends really are. Sooner or later he will have to deal with the
considerably more taxing issues of Islamist militancy, rogue nuclear states and
other tangible threats to the West's security. At that point, Obama will
discover a simple but essential truth. The world divides between those who
support American values of freedom and democracy, and those who seek to destroy
them.
Few nations have been more committed to- supporting those values with
both blood and treasure than Britain. This country, and especially those British
troops fighting alongside their American counterparts, deserve far better than
this president's disregard.

Iraq war build-up 'left us scrabbling for smoking gun' says ex-UK ambassador
Sir Christopher Meyer says plans to invade Iraq did not give time for weapons
inspectors

The military timetable for an invasion of Iraq <ntt //www.guardianco. world/iraq>
in 2003 did not give time for UN weapons-inspectors in the country to do their
job, the former British ambassador to Washington told the Iraq inquiry in London

today.
Sir Christopher Meyer said the "unforgiving nature" of the build-up after
American forces had been told to prepare for war meant that "we found ourselves
scrabbling for the smoking gun".
He added: "It was another way of saying 'it's not that Saddam has to prove that
he's innocent, we've now bloody well got to try and prove he's guilty.' And we -
the Americans, the British - have never really recovered from that because of
course there was no smoking gun."
The US had first prepared for invasion in January but the date was later moved
to March. "All that said, when you looked at the timetable for the inspections,
it was impossible to see how [Hans] Blix [chief weapons inspector] could bring
the process to a conclusion, for better or for worse, by March."
Meyer said he had been in favour of removing Saddam. He thought you did not need •
9/11 or weapons of mass destruction to justify confronting Iraq. Saddam had not
lived up to the commitments given after the first Gulf war. He had "the means
and the will" to build weapons even if he hid not have them at the time.
Meyer said he did not know what made the UK fix "on a very large land force by
our standards". He believed it would not have damaged Britain's standing in the
US to have sent fewer troops to Iraq, but actively opposing the war would have
done.
Earlier Meyer said George Bush's administration was seen by many as "running out
of steam" on the eve of the "great atrocity" of the 9/11 attacks on the US.
It looked like an administration that had run into trouble very quickly, the
former ambassador to Washington said. People were saying the effort of getting
big tax cuts and medical prescription benefits for older people through Congress
had "killed" Bush, Meyer said. He added that secretary of state Colin Powell's
efforts to.narrow and deepen sanctions against Iraq had failed and there was a
"huge bear market" against Donald Rumsfeld, the defence secretary.
Meyer said attitudes towards Iraq were influenced to an extent not appreciated
by him at the time by the anthrax scare in the US soon after 9/11

were sent anthrax spores in the post, a crime that led to the death of five
people, prompting policvmakers to claim links to Saddam Hussein.
Meyer told the third day of Sir John Chilcot's hearings that from the onset of
the Bush presidency in 2001, there was enthusiasm on the Republican right for
arming and supporting Iraqi dissidents, "mostly in London", particularly the
Iraqi National Congress led by Ahmad Chalabi.
Powell was sceptical of such "belligerent" moves, concentrating on sanctions
with Robin Cook, the then-British foreign secretary, with whom, Meyer said,
"somewhat to my surprise", he got on well.
On 9/11 Condoleezza Rice, then the US national security adviser, told Meyer she
was in "no doubt: it was an al-Qaida operation". The following weekend Bush and
his key advisers met at Camp David and contacts later told Meyer there had been
a "big ding-dong" about Iraq and Saddam.
It seemed that Paul Wolfowitz, Rumsfeld's deputy, argued for retaliation to
include Iraq, Meyer said. It was not clear where Rumsfeld stood. But later that
month Bush and Tony Blair, on a visit to Washington, were agreed on a
"laser-like focus" on al-Qaida and Pakistan.
Blair's reputation had soared "above all others" because of his support for the
US, the former ambassador told the inquiry.
But the anthrax scare had "steamed up" policy makers in Bush's administration
and helped swing attitudes against Saddam, who the administration believed. had
been the last person to use anthrax.
Rice fell more and more "in the camp of Powell's enemies". There was a "sea
chanae" in attitudes to containment but the UK still had "a legal problem" with
regime change. Meyer told British officials to argue that the alliance would be
in better shape if there was international support for military action. There
was no need to argue that with the state department. But there was with Dick
Cheney,. the vice-president, and Rumsfeld.
Asked about Blair's meeting with Bush at Crawford, Texas, in April 2002, where,
some observers believe, the decision to go to war was made, Meyer said: "To this
day I'm not entirely clear what degree of convergence was signed in blood at the
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766156 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766156 Date: 07/31/2015
Texas range."
But a speech by Blair the following day was, he believed, the first time the
prime minister had publicaly said "regime change". "What he was trying to do was
to draw the lessons of 9/11 and apply them to the situation in Iraq, which led -
I think not inadvertently but deliberately - to a conflation of the threat posed
by Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein.
"When I heard that speech, I thought that this represents a tightening of the
UK/US alliance and a degree of convergence on the danger Saddam Hussein
presented."

Poll: Clinton approval
soars
By: Eamon „lavers
December 16, 2009 03:00
PM EST
A new poll of avid news watchers
shows that Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton has a much higher
approval rating than the man she
once campaigned against and now
works for, President Barack
Obama.
In the poll of 800 registered voters
who are self-identified "news
watchers," Clinton had a 75 percent
approval rating and a 21 percent
disapproval rating overall. Obama,
in contrast, had a 51 percent
approval and a 45 percent
disapproval rating.
The Secretary of State has
conducted several well-received
foreign trips in recent months and
has not been as closely identified
with the more contentious elements
of the Administration's agenda,
including the health care fight, the
federal deficit and the Wall Street
bailouts. And she has not been
subjected to nearly the same media
and partisan scrutiny as the
president. Obama, meanwhile, has
been on national television on a _
daily basis tackling a wide range of
difficult issues.
The poll was conducted by the

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766224 Date: 08/31/2015
nonpartisan Clarus Research
Group from December 7th to the
12th, and it asked for opinions of
the top Cabinet secretaries and
White House officials. Its finding on
Obama and Clinton mirrors that of
earlier polls — in October, for
example, a Gallup poll found that
Clinton had become more popular
than the president.
Clarus president Ron Faucheux
said one reason for Clinton's high
poll numbers is her high approval
among Republicans — numbers he
said position her well to run for
president again in the future, if she
chooses. Clinton had 96 percent
approval among Democrats, a
healthy 57 percent approval among
Republicans, and 65 percent
approval among Independents.
Obama was nearly as popular
among Democrats — 93 percent —
but his numbers among
Republicans and Independents fell
off dramatically, at 19 percent and
33 percent respectively.
Clinton's Republican numbers are
striking, given how intensely
disliked she has been in the past
among GOP voters. In fact, part of
Obama's appeal to Democratic
primary voters in 2008 was that he
was more likely to be able to bridge
the partisan divide than Clinton,
who was by then a well-known
figure dating to her time as first lady
in the 1990s.
"Republicans may see her as being
more hawkish than other
Democrats on foreign policy
issues," said Faucheux. "It may be
a way for them to bolster that
position within the administration."
Asked about any future Clinton
presidential bid, he said, "She's in
good shape now."

The next highest-rated cabinet
secretary in the survey was
Defense Secretary Robert Gates,
who notched a 69 percent overall
approval rate with a 78 percent
approval among Democrats and 63
percent among both Republicans
and independents.
"Both Clinton and Gates did well
across the partisan board," said
Faucheux. "Everybody else did well
among Democrats but fell off
among Republicans."
Another trend spotted by the
pollsters: Approval ratings inside
the Beltway were higher than in the
rest of the country. "These results
show that the 'Beltway echo
chamber' does not reflect the rest of
the country, even among news
watchers," said Faucheux.
Among White House staffers and
advisors, Press Secretary Robert
Gibbs — who is often seen on
television — had the highest overall
rating at 50 percent. Economic
advisor Larry Summers had the
lowest approval, at 25 percent.
Summers and Treasury Secretary
Timothy Geithner — who are both
closely associated with the
economy — both posted higher
disapproval numbers than approval.
Summers' disapproval rating was
41 percent. Geithner's disapproval
rating was 45 percent, one point
higher than his approval rating.
The poll also found that White
House Chief of Staff Rahm
Emanuel, who is often viewed as
having sharp partisan elbows,
scored much higher among
Democrats, at 72 percent, than
Republicans, at 13 percent.
Among other major administration

officials, Vice President Joe Biden
had a 50 percent approval and 41
percent disapproval rating; Attorney
General Eric Holder and HHS
Secretary Kathleen Sebelius both
posted 41 percent approval and 35
percent disapproval; Presidential
Adviser David Axelrod scored 38
percent approval and 36 percent
disapproval; and National Security
Adviser James Jones had a 30
percent approval and 23 percent
disapproval rating.

Obama, The Fallen Messiah and The Problem
ith Secular Salvation Narratives
F[By Ma): Biurrie.nthal - December 16, 2009, 8:10PM
In responding to my initial post, Sarah Posner, Todd Gitlin, and Fred Clarkson make some very important points about the
appeal of the Christian right to ordinary Americans. I think their points dovetail with one another. Posner argues quite
correctly that those who I described as giving up their individual freedom for the authoritarian structure of the right believe
they are gaining new life in the Kingdom of God, along with a sense of community and belonging. She illustrates this trend
in her excellent book on the rising trend of prosperity gospel theology in evangelical churches, Gpd's
Clarkson adds that the salvation narrative the movement offers to trauma-wracked individuals is one of its key draws. This
narrative often takes an explicitly political form, promising the replacement of a culturally decadent secular government
with a theocratically-inspired authoritarian system (see Newt Gingrich 's retrhatrika at David Horovvitz's Renaissance
Weekend for a recent example of this appeal). Or, as Gitlin said, the salvation narrative may promise eternal life in
Heaven -- after the enemies of God are slaughtered en masse in a display of pornographic violence, as portrayed in Tim
LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins' bestselling Left Behind Series.
During a time of economic decline, persistent cultural strife, deepening American involvement in far-off military conflicts,
and rapid environmental deterioration, is there any wonder that some have turned to apocalyptic salvation narratives
promising both a transcendent, everlasting future and violent retribution against perceived evildoers? A 2002 CNN poll
found that 59% of Americans believe that the prophecies in the Book of Revelations will come true. The startling number
reflected the still-fresh trauma of the 9/11 attacks, but suspect that it has held steady, if not risen. Indeed, mainstream
American culture is permeated by apocalypticism; the blockbuster movie hit 2012 is but one recent example.
spend several chapters in my book following the Christian right's ascent to the mountain top with George W. Bush's re-
election, detailing how the movement shrouded science and reason in the shadow of the cross, then observing as it swiftly
imploded during the Tern Schiavo charade. Because I completed my book days after Barad< Obama's inauguration, I was
only able to foreshadow the right's plan to undermine the new president. Having watched the right attempt to delegitimize
and literally overthrow Bill Clinton for eight years, I did not harbor any illusions about Obantia transcending partisan
division by becoming the _
l'iberei pag::
:caddwho o!.4.0._reunite .ArriericLl as many argued.
What I did not include in my book was any sense of where the Democratic left was going, or how this movement had
developed its own salvation narrative during the Bush era. Only a presidency as destructive and radical as Bush's could
have produced such deep levels of anxiety and desperation among progressives. When the Democratic primary began,
some progressives seemed to ache for a secular messiah to descend from the political heavens, reverse Bush's
disastrous legacy and save the country from itself..
in their quest for a savior, progressives discovered Barack Obama. "I serve as a blank screen on which people of vastly
different political stripes project their own views," Obama proclaimed in his book, The Audacity of Hope. As Obama's
primary battle against Hiiiary Clinton intensified, his rhetoric and the language of his supporters grew increasingly
messianic. At a rally in South Carolina, Oprah Winfrey referred to °barna as "The One," a fusion of Jesus and Nleo from
The Matrix. When Obarria defeated Clinton in Iowa, he quoted from a Hopi Indian End Times prophecy that had become
popular among New Agers: "W
:
s. oro?s we've '01:.en waiting. for.',' Moved to the point of ecstasy by Obama's victory
speech, Ezra Klein declared the candidate, "not the Word made flesh, but the triumph of the word over flesh... Obarna is,
at his best, able to call us back to our higher selves."
(Though he is not a progressive by even the wildest stretch of the imagination, it is worth noting that Louis Farrakhan, who
had consistently ordered his followers to boycott elections and who attacked black politicians from Harold Washington to
Jesse Jackson as tools of the white power structure, '
.je.f.,
-
.GrE‘id in no uncertain terms that Obama was the Messiah.)
Now that some of Obama's most zealous supporters are beginning to express grave doubts about his ability to deliver the
transcendent change he promised, I think it is time for them to consider their role in contributing to the problems °barna
faces with both his Democratic base and his opponents on the right. They embraced a secular salvation narrative that
°barna cleverly channeled to excite them and distract from his lack of progressive accomplishments. In the end, Obama's
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766243 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766243 Date: 08/31/2015
messianization created false expectations while establishing political space for the right to undermine and delegitimize
him.
To be sure; Obama's salvation narrative was dramatically different than the dualistic, malignant version that prevails on
the Christian right. Obama never, to my knowledge, played to his supporters' dark sides by promising them holy retribution
against their perceived enemies. In fact, part of his appeal stemmed from his repudiation of partisan rancor -- there were
no red states where people reject science, demonize gays and attack minority rights. Until he was inaugurated, Obama
behaved like a secular Messiah in a world without a Devil.
In my book. I detail a series of experiments by a group of political psychologists seeking to provide evidence that the fear
of death inspires extreme conservative beliefs -- including apocalypticisrn. Their study was inspired by a theory of cultural
anthropologist Ernest Becker: "The idea of death, the fear of it, haunts the human animal like nothing else; it is a
mainspring of human activity - designed largely to avoid the fatality of death, to overcome it by denying in some way that it
is the final destiny of man." The professors discovered that time and again, their study subjects would register more
conservative responses to questions if they were first reminded of their own deaths. (See John Judis' excellent artide on
the studies for more).
The use of mortality reminders came in to play as soon as Obama was inaugurated. Almost immediately, the right
attempted to delegitimize him by reversing the phenomenon he relied on to win: While he attempted to serve as a blank
screen for Americans to project their aspirations upon, they projected their most fearsome inner demons onto him. During
the October McCain-Palin rallies, Sarah Palin and far-right surrogates like Joe the Plumber attacked Obama as an Other,
a strange outsider who did not share mainstream American values. Their intention was to make him as unfamiliar and
frightening as possible, and in doing so, to scare off wavering independent voters. By this time, it was too late in the
campaign for the tactic to take effect, so it extended into this year and peaked during the Fall Teabagger rallies and town
hall disruptions.
Teabagger activists transposed images of Stalin and Hitler onto Obama's face. (Their propaganda bore a disturbing
resemblance to the signs waved by right-wing Jewish settlers during rallies against Yitzhak Rabin that depicted the soon
to be assassinated Israeli PM in Nazi SS garb and as the collaborator Marshall Petain, two seemingly incongruous
images). Obama was a Muslim; Obama was a commie; Obama was a cosmopolitan globalist; Obama was a black
nationalist. It did not matter who Obama really was. The right simply wanted to convince America he was The Other. As
cynical as their tactic is, it has damaged Obama in large part because he offered himself up as "a blank screen," defining
himself as he thought different audiences wished to see him, and ultimately not establishing a very clear identity at all.
The right has complemented its anti-Obama propaganda with false rumors designed to inject the language of death into
the healthcare debate. The single most damaging rumor, adopted from the cult of Lyndon LaRouche, refined by
healthcare industry lobbyist Betsy McCaughey. and popularized by Sarah Palin, was that Obarna's healthcare reform
proposal included a plan to implement "death panels." While the president pleaded for compromise and reason, the right
repeated the baseless charge over and over that he planned to pull the plug on grandma, euthanize the severely
handicapped, and kill the sick. Obama has not yet recovered from the damage the right's mortality reminders did to his
political standing.
Since Obama announced his plan to escalate the war in Afghanistan, and with the White House apparently poised to
scrap the public option and Medicare buy-in proposals to mollify Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the progressive left is going into
contortions. Turn on 1VISNIBC or read any major progressive blog and you will see former Obama zealots proclaim, "Kill
the bill!" while assailing the president as an empty suit.
The liberal left has become so disgruntled that a leading conservative talk radio host asked me recently if progressives
were considering a primary challenge to Obama. I laughed and stated my belief that despite his troubles, Obama would
win a second term. Whether or not that happens, those former Obama fanatics experiencing a crisis in faith should look in
the mirror. They demanded a secular salvation narrative and participated in the near-deification of the politician who so
eloquently delivered it to them. They now know that Obama is just a politician. What they have refused to acknowledge is
that he would not have fallen so hard had they not lifted him so high.

`Appointing Blair as EU president will have
consequences', warns Hague
William Hague's strident attack on his fellow Briton reportedly left some of the EU ambassadors baffled
Francis Elliott, David Charter and Tom Baldwin
William Hague has been conducting a behind-the-scenes campaign to convince European ambassadors that Tony Blair
would be a bad choice for European Union president, The Times has learnt. The Shadow Foreign Secretary used a lunch
organised by the Swedish presidency in London last week to lobby the most senior diplomats of the 26 other EU nations
against the appointment.
EU leaders had hoped to choose the new president at next week's summit, but the Czech Republic's last-minute
objections to the Lisbon treaty have scuppered that. President Sarkozy of France wants a quick decision, however, and is
understood to be pushing for a special one-day summit in Brussels next month to fill the new post.
In making the Conservatives' case against Mr Blair, Mr Hague said that while in Downing Street the former Prime Minister
had consistently placed a higher priority on US interests than on those of Europe. Mr Hague also reminded the diplomats
of Mr Blair's actions in the run-up to the Iraq war, according to one of those attending the lunch last Thursday.
A claim that Mr Hague told the ambassadors that the Tories would regard Mr Blair's appointment as a "declaration of war"
by the EU was denied, however. A spokesman for Mr Hague said that the phrase was "a bit strong". Nevertheless, it was
not disputed that Mr Hague made clear that the move would have consequences for relations between Britain and
Brussels. Diplomats said that there was a "clear mark of hostility".
"Mr Hague wanted to leave the ambassadors in no doubt that the Conservative Party is opposed to the appointment of
Tony Blair as president of the European Council and [that] it would only underline the lack of accountability and legitimacy
involved in the creation of the position in the first place," Mr Hague's spokesman said. Mr Hague's strident attack on his
fellow Briton reportedly left some of the ambassadors baffled.
Mr Hague is currently in Washington for talks with members of the Obama Administration, including Hillary Clinton, the
Secretary of State, with whom he raised the issue of the Conservatives' membership of a right-wing alliance of European
parties with allegedly anti-Semitic members. He accused critics of running a smear campaign against some of the group,
led by Michal Kaminsky, head of Poland's Law and Justice Party.

Re: Tony Blair, EU presidency, Tory Party, & Berlin trip
One of your agenda items behind the scenes on your Berlin trip can be to discuss the future of the EU, the
European presidency and the prospects of Tony Blair. If Blair does not become EU president the position will
likely be filled by a third rank nonentity in the Brussels bureaucratic mode incapable of realizing the
possibilities in the creation of the office, continuing the feebleness of Europe as a political idea and reality. Of
course, it is in the US interest to have a strong Europe—and the naming of the first European president might be
the most important opportunity for the US to strengthen Europe, to give it actual sinew, for a long time and a
long time to come.
The Conservative Party is split over Europe and Blair. Hague represents the Tory right, which is the center of
the party. He is supported prominently by Boris Johnson, mayor of London, also known as the Tory "clown
prince." The responsible wing, such as Chris Patten, the former European Commissioner, and Douglas Hurd,
former Foreign Secretary, are pro-European and not necessarily hostile to having Blair there as a counter-weight
to the anti-Europeans of their own government, helping to tilt things more their way. All present themselves as
"pro-American," sine qua non of Conservative rhetoric, though there is a nasty anti-American undercurrent on
the Tory right. Hague tried to paper this over in his conference with you and was disingenuous about the nature
of the far right parties the Tories are aligned with in Europe. Nobody in the UK or Europe is fooled.
Cameron is trying to balance the wings of the Conservative Party. On domestic policy, he is more radical than
his Etonian image suggests (profound connotations of the Conservative paternalistic, aristocratic one-nation
tradition), more influenced by the Thatcher legacy, more like George W. Bush influenced by Reagan and
Reaganism than by his father and vestigial moderate Republicanism. On foreign policy, Cameron is unsure,
inexperienced, oblique, and largely uncommitted. So far his foreign policy is little more than projection of his
domestic politics, especially his need to keep his party behind him going into the election. His political

imperatives have pressured him to lean right, including on alignment with the far right European
Parliament affiliation. His future problem is that he does not want to be the leader who takes
Britain out of Europe but is putting himself in a position where he may not be able to prevent his
party doing so.
Enter the Blair factor. The Europeans do not want a Britain sliding out of Europe or acting as an
uncertain partner. Blair is probably the best possible solution. But the anti-European forces
within Europe and within the Tory Party are conspiring against Blair now to thwart that
possibility.
I spoke with Jonathan Powell this week and he tells me the following: "The argument is slipping
away from us a bit at the moment so anything Hillary can do would be gratefully appreciated in
speaking to other European leaders or what she says in public about the need for Europe to
have a major figure at its head so that other powers can relate to it."

How do I know China wrecked the Copenhagen
deal? I was in the room
As recriminations fly post-Copenhagen, one writer offers a fly-on-the-wall account of how talks faded
0

o c.
..q,uk, Tuesday 22 December 2009 19.54 GMT
Copenhagen was a disaster. That much is agreed. But the truth about what actually happened is in danger of being lost
amid the spin and inevitable mutual recriminations. The truth is this: Chrs.a wrecked the talks, intentionally humiliated
Barack Obama, and insisted on an awful "dear so western leaders would walk away carrying the blame. How do I know
this? Because I was in the room and saw it happen.
China's strategy was simple: block the open negotiations for two weeks, and then ensure that the closed-door deal made
It look as if the west had failed the world's poor once again. And sure enough, the aid agencies, civil society movements
and environmental groups all took the bait. The failure was "the inevitable result of rich countries refusing adequately and
fairly to shoulder their overwhelming responsibility", said Christian Aid. "Rich countries have bullied developing nations,"
fumed Friends of the Earth International.
All very predictable, but the complete opposite of the truth. Even George IVIonbiot, writing in yesterday's Guardian, made
the mistake of singly blaming Obama. But I saw Obama fighting desperately to salvage a deal, and the Chinese delegate
saying "no", over and over again. Monbiot even approvingly quoted the Sudanese delegate Lumumba Di-Aping, who
denounced the Copenhagen accord as "a suicide pact, an incineration pact, in order to maintain the economic dominance
of a few countries".
Sudan behaves at the talks as a puppet of China; one of a number of countries that relieves the Chinese delegation of
having to fight its battles in open sessions. It was a perfect stitch-up. China gutted the deal behind the scenes, and then
left its proxies to savage it in public.
Here's what actually went on late last Friday night, as heads of state from two dozen countries met behind closed doors.
Obama was at the table for several hours, sitting between Gordon Brown and the Ethiopian prime minister, Males Zenawi.
The Danish prime minister chaired, and on his right sat Ban Ki-moon, secretary-general of the UN. Probably only about 50
or 60 people, including the heads of state, were in the room. I was attached to one of the delegations, whose head of
state was also present for most of the time.
What I saw was profoundly shocking. The Chinese premier, Wen Jinbao, did not deign to attend the meetings personally,
instead sending a second-tier official in the country's foreign ministry to sit opposite Obama himself. The diplomatic snub
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766567 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766567 Date: 08/31/2015
was obvious and brutal, as was the practical implication: several times during the session, the world's most powerful
heads of state were forced to wait around as the Chinese delegate went off to make telephone calls to his "superiors".
Shifting the blame
To those who would blame Obama and rich countries in general, know this: it was China's representative who insisted
that industrialised country targets, previously agreed as an 80% cut by 2050, be taken out of the deal. "Why can't we even
mention our own targets?" demanded a furious Angela Merkel. Australia's prime minister, Kevin Rudd, was annoyed
enough to bang his microphone. Brazil's representative too pointed out the illogicality of China's position. Why should rich
countries not announce even this unilateral cut? The Chinese delegate said no, and I watched, aghast, as Merkel threw
up her hands in despair and conceded the point. Now we know why — because China bet, correctly, that Obama would
get the blame for the Copenhagen accord's lack of ambition.
China, backed at times by India, then proceeded to take out all the numbers that mattered. A 2020 peaking year in global
emissions, essential to restrain temperatures to 2C, was removed and replaced by woolly language suggesting that
emissions should peak "as soon as possible". The long-term target, of global 50% cuts by 2050, was also excised. No one
else, perhaps with the exceptions of India and Saudi Arabia, wanted this to happen. I am certain that had the Chinese not
been in the room, we would have left Copenhagen with a deal that had environmentalists popping champagne corks
popping in every corner of the world.
Strong position
So how did China manage to pull off this coup? First, it was in an extremely strong negotiating position. China didn't need
a deal. As one developing country foreign minister said to me: "The Athenians had nothing to offer to the Spartans." On
the other hand, western leaders in particular — but also presidents Lula of Brazil, Zuma of South Africa, Calderon of
Mexico and many others — were desperate for a positive outcome. Obama needed a strong deal perhaps more than
anyone. The US had confirmed the offer of $100bn to developing countries for adaptation, put serious cuts on the table for
the first time (17% below 2005 levels by 2020), and was obviously prepared to up its offer.
Above all, Obama needed to be able to demonstrate to the Senate that he could deliver China in any global climate
regulation framework, so conservative senators could not argue that US carbon cuts would further advantage Chinese
industry. With midterm elections looming, Obama and his staff also knew that Copenhagen would be probably their only
opportunity to go to cjinT3t?j..chanQE-3. talks with a strong mandate. This further strengthened China's negotiating hand, as
did the complete lack of civil society political pressure on either China or India. Campaign groups never blame developing
countries for failure; this is an iron rule that is never broken. The Indians, in particular. have become past masters at ca-
opting the language of equity ("equal rights to the atmosphere") in the service of planetary suicide — and leftish
campaigners and commentators are hoist with their own petard.
With the deal gutted, the heads of state session concluded with a final battle as the Chinese delegate insisted on
removing the 1.5C target so beloved of the small island states and low-lying nations who have most to lose from rising
seas. President Nasheed of the Maldives, supported by Brown, fought valiantly to save this crucial number. "How can you
ask my country to go extinct?" demanded Nasheed. The Chinese delegate feigned great offence — and the number
stayed, but surrounded by language which makes it all but meaningless. The deed was done.
China's game
All this raises the question: what is China's game? Why did China, in the words of a UK-based analyst who also spent
hours in heads of state meetings, "not only reject targets for itself, but also refuse to allow any other country to take on
binding targets?" The analyst, who has attended climate conferences for more than 15 years, concludes that China wants
to weaken the climate regulation regime now "in order to avoid the risk that it might be called on to be more ambitious in a
few years' time".
This does not mean China is not serious about global warming. It is strong in both the wind and solar industries. But
China's growth, and growing global political and economic dominance, is based largely on cheap coal. China knows it is
becoming an uncontested superpower; indeed its newfound muscular confidence was on striking display in Copenhagen.
Its coal-based economy doubles every decade, and its power increases commensurately. Its leadership will not alter this
magic formula unless they absolutely have to.
Copenhagen was much worse than just another bad deal, because it illustrated a profound shift in global geopolitics. This
is fast becoming China's century, yet its leadership has displayed that multilateral environmental governance is not only
not a priority, but is viewed as a hindrance to the new superpower's freedom of action. I left Copenhagen more
despondent than I have felt in a long time. After all the hope and all the hype, the mobilisation of thousands, a wave of
optimism crashed against the rock of global power politics, fell back, and drained away.

Civilian, military planners have different views on new
approach to Afghanistan
By Rajiv Chandrasekaran
Washington Post Staff Writer
Saturday, December 26, 2009; A01
Two days before announcing the deployment of additional U.S. troops to 8fg,rianistan, President Obama informed Gen.
Stanley A. McChrystal that he was not granting McChrystal's request to double the size of the Afghan army and police.
Cost was a factor, as were questions about whether the capacity exists to train 400,000 personnel. The president told
McChrystal, the top commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, to focus for now on fielding a little more than
half that number by next October.
Ten days after Obama's speech, the U.S. command responsible for training the Afghans circulated a chart detailing the
combined personnel targets for the army and police. McChrystal's goal of 400,000 remained unchanged.
"It's an open issue," a senior Pentagon official said last week.
Nearly a month after Obama unveiled his revised Afghanistan strategy, military and civilian leaders have come away with
differing views of several fundamental aspects of the president's new approach, according to more than a dozen senior
administration and military officials involved in Afghanistan policy, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to
discuss internal deliberations.
Members of Obama's war cabinet disagree over the meaning of his pledge to begin drawing down forces in July 2011 and
whether the mission has been narrowed from a proposal advanced by McChrystal in his August assessment of the war.
The disagreements have opened a fault line between a desire for an early exit among several senior officials at the White
House and a conviction among military commanders that victory is still achievable on their terms.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766890 Date: 08/31/2015
The differences are complicating implementation of the new strategy. Some officers have responded to the July 2011 date
by seeking to accelerate the pace of operations, instead of narrowing them. At the White House, a senior administration
official said, the National Security Council is discussing ways to increase monitoring of military and State Department
activities in Afghanistan to prevent "overreaching."
The NSC's strategic guidance, a classified document that outlines the president's new approach, was described by the
senior administration official as limiting military operations "in scale and scope to the minimum required to achieve two
goals -- to prevent ai-Qaeda safe havens and to prevent the Taliban from toppling the government." The use of resource-
intensive counterinsurgency tactics -- employing U.S. forces to protect Afghan civilians from the Taliban -- is supposed to
be restricted to key cities and towns in southern and eastern parts of the country, the official said.
"The strategy has fundamentally changed. This is not a COIN strategy," Vice President Biden said on MSNBC last week,
using the military's shorthand for counterinsurgency. "This is not 'go out and occupy the whole country.' "
Setting limits
During a videoconference two days before the speech, Obama made it clear to McChristal and U.S. Ambassador Karl W.
Eikenberry that he did not want the additional troops to fuel a broader mission. Speaking to both men from the White
House Situation Room, the president told them not to deploy the forces to areas they would not be able to transfer to
Afghan security forces by July 2011, according to two senior officials with knowledge of the conversation.
Obama's essential instruction was, according to one of the officials, "Don't bite off more than you can chew."
White House officials said the president opposes using the forces he has authorized to duplicate an expansive, iraq-style
counterinsurgency operation -- in part because he questions whether it will be possible to achieve a similar outcome in
Afghanistan, which is less developed, and because he wants to start reducing troops in 18 months. The White House's
desired end state in Afghanistan, officials said, envisions more informal local security arrangements than in Iraq, a less-
capable national government and a greater tolerance of insurgent violence.
Senior military officials still think they can achieve a better outcome than envisaged by civilian skeptics in the
administration by using the new forces to mount more comprehensive counterinsurgency operations. Although Pentagon
strategists and McChrystal's advisers in Kabul are looking at how they can fulfill the White House desire for a less
extensive mission, military officials said they are reluctant to strip too much away and weaken an approach that has come
to be revered within the ranks as the only way to suppress guerrilla movements.
Military officials contend that McChrystal does not harbor expansionist aims. They note that he has begun removing
troops from remote mountain valleys and concentrating resources on a modest number of key population centers. But the
approach in those areas will involve counterinsurgency tactics: Troops will focus on restoring normal patterns of life by
trying to keep the Taliban at bay, helping the Afghan government provide basic services to the population and training
local security forces.
McChrystal's plan, the senior Pentagon official said, "is still counterinsurgency, regardless of the various agendas people
are trying to spin."
Dissent over drawdown
During strategy discussions at the White House, differences between the White House and the military came into sharp
relief over °baffle's decision to announce his intention to begin drawing down troops in July 2011.
McChrystal argued against it, according to three officials familiar with the process. The head of the U.S. Central
Command, Gen. David H. Petraeus, also expressed concerns. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates urged Obama to
make the drawdoWn "conditions-based."
"There was a lot of push back" from the Defense Department, one of the officials said.
The president received cover from one uniformed general at the table, James E. Cartwright, the vice chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff. Cartwright had adopted a more skeptical view of the mission than many of his military colleagues, one that
resonated with Obama and Biden.
Cartwright effectively endorsed the July 2011 date, arguing that increasing forces and engaging in limited
counterinsurgency made sense, the senior administration official said, "but given the risk factors -- Pakistan, the Karzai
government, the whole notion of sub-national governance and our track record with the [Afghan security forces], which is
not prestigious -- that it made sense to demonstrate that we could actually do this."
It. also helped Obama that the principal troop-increase proposal being discussed at the time -- a recommendation that
McChrystal receive 30,000 forces for 18 to 24 months -- had been developed by Gates. The Defense Department
paperwork detailing the proposal identified the increase as starting in the summer of 2009, when the first troops deployed
by the president this year began conducting operations in Afghanistan, but it did not specify an end date.
"Rather than leaving this indefinite and hypothetical, the president's intervention was to say, 'Okay, if we're starting in July
of '09, then we're really talking about July of '11," said the senior administration official who described the NSC guidance.
Obama eventually told his war cabinet that he would announce the July 2011 deadline but that the pace of withdrawals
would be determined, as Gates had sought, by conditions on the ground. Obama said he would conduct a thorough
review of progress in a year's time. Although he did not endorse McChrystal's request to increase the Afghan security
forces to 400,000, he said he would reevaluate the issue once the 2010 goal of training 230,000 forces is achieved.
The president avoided details in his Dec. 1 address, leaving it up to members of his Cabinet and to his advisers to explain
the specifics. The result has been a wide divergence of expectations. Gates, appearing on NBC's "Meet the Press" the
Sunday after the speech, said that perhaps only "some handful or some small number" would be withdrawn. Biden, during

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766890 Date: 08/31/2015
his MSNBC appearance last week, said a chart showing an increase in U.S. deployments this year would be "coming
down as rapidly over the next two years."
The ambiguity over the meaning of the July 2011 deadline has generated uncertainty over the presidents intent. "Is the
surge a way of helping us leave more quickly, or is the timeline a way to help win support for the surge?" asked a senior
Democratic staff member in Congress. "Which is the strategy and which is the head-fake? Nobody knows."
One senior military officer in Afghanistan said he and his fellow soldiers "don't know if this is all over in 18 months, or
whether this is just a progress report that leads to minor changes."
"Until they tell us otherwise," the officer said, "we're operating as if the latter is the policy."
A 'dramatic change'?
Although senior-level civilians in the administration emerged from the review process thinking the mission had been
circumscribed, senior military officials continue to have a different view. The result, as they see it, is that the White House
has embraced McChrystal's original plan.
"We had already been pretty focused that we wouldn't try to clear and hold things more than we needed to," said a senior
commander involved in the war. "It wasn't a dramatic change by any means."
White House officials have cited a meeting among NSC staff members and McChrystal in which the general displayed a
slide stating that his mission was to "Defeat the Taliban," which some civilians deemed overly ambitious because it
suggested that every last member of the Taliban would have to be killed or captured. The officials said the mission was
redefined to avoid the term.
But to military officers, defeat "doesn't mean wipe everyone out," the commander said. "It means after Waterloo,
Napoleon still had an army but he wasn't going to threaten Europe. We used that view when we worked defeat."
Even before the White House review had finished, the commander in charge of day-to-day operations, Lt. Gen. David M.
Rodriguez, had developed a plan to concentrate U.S. and NATO efforts in 80 of the country's nearly 400 districts.
"They're taking credit for some of the things that McChrystal was already doing and calling it a narrowed focus," a senior
military official said.
White House advisers maintain that the review process did refine the mission beyond what McChrystal had proposed over
the summer.
"There was a real narrowing here," the senior administration official said. "Stan has a big leadership task to adapt his
original concept to the new strategic guidance."
The official said NSC officials recognize it will take time for the new orders to filter through the ranks. "This doesn't turn
around with a speech," the official said. "But I hope we don't see slides a month from now that continue to state that our
goal is 400,000" Afghan security forces.
The challenge, said that official and another senior administration official, is to recalibrate military operations over the next
18 months in accordance with the new goal.
"The guidance they have is that we're not doing everything, and we're not doing it forever," the second official said. "The
hardest intellectual exercise will be settling on how much is enough."
For now, however, top military officers speak more expansively than White House advisers.
"Winning means we hand off to a security force that can secure the country," the senior Pentagon official said. "We've
separated the enemy, we've connected the people to the government, and we're helping them to rebuild their economy.
It's at that point that we begin to transition it over to them."
Terms such as "winning" and "victory" have been eschewed by the White House. Obama did not use either in his Dec. 1
address, and he said in an interview earlier this year that he was uncomfortable using the term "victory" when fighting "a
non-state actor, a shadowy operation like al-Qaeda."
But when Gates visited Kabul a week after Obama's speech, he made a point of telling military personnel there that "we
are in this thing to win."
"From a moral perspective, when you ask soldiers and families to sacrifice, we do that to win," the Pentagon official said.
"We need to be able to articulate winning."

Re: Backdrop to your coming week
Below is a piece published today in The Observer, the Sunday newspaper of The Guardian, on the Chilcot
inquiry, summarizing the testimony so far and what is expected this week while you are drumming up support
for the Afghanistan initiative. Britain and Europe are riveted by Chilcot, especially official circles. The
objective correlative, of course, is trust in any 11.S. administration and deep skepticism about the Afghanistan
project. Yet another undercurrent among the mandarins is disdainful resentment of indifference to Britain, a
sentiment beyond Labour or the Tories but what has emerged as the view of the permanent establishment at
Whitehall and elsewhere.
Mandelson Watch: After Miliband declined to reach for the EU foreign secretaryship (though Sarkozy wanted
him to take it and Brown was not averse, even favorable), Mandelson personally campaigned on his own for it
among the Europeans. Mandelson was eager to Miliband to take the EU post, allowing Mandelson to be
appointed foreign minister. When Miliband refused, Mandelson's ambition was thwarted, and tried to seize the
EU position for himself, but without any backing in Europe or from Gordon. The Europeans thought him mad.
Suddenly, they recalled his bad or strange behavior as UK commissioner to the EU. When Christine Ashton was
named, Mandelson briefed the press on her lack of credentials, etc. Ashton, as it happens, had worked the press
to try to help Mandelson when he had gotten into the mess that led to his first resignation. Those inside the
government who remember this see it as an illustration of the principle that no good deed goes unpunished.
Mandelson, in a snit, is now not speaking to Gordon as 'though his rejection were Gordon's fault.

Chilcot Inquiry: Mandarins take revenge on Tony Blair over Iraq Civil servants and diplomats are lining up to stick a knife
into former PM's reputation
* Toby Helm <http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tobyhelm> and Rajeev Syal
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/rajeev-syal>
* The Observer <http://observerguardian.co.uk> , Sunday 29 November 2009
* Whitehall mandarins are supreme masters of subtle evasion. But they do not rise to the top of their trade without
also knowing how to stick in the knife.
At times the Chilcot inquiry into Britain's involvement in Iraq since 2001, which opened last week, resembled a
gentlemen's club moved to the sanitised surroundings of the Queen Elizabeth fl Conference Centre in Westminster.
Oxbridge-educated pillars of the establishment politely questioned other Oxbridge-educated pillars of the establishment
about who said what to whom in which memo. The inquiry is a peculiar mixture of the old and the new, the open and
closed. It is conducted in the language of Whitehall, yet beamed live by webcam to the world.
Critics are convinced that, for all Sir John Chilcot's promises to the contrary, it will turn out to be another Whitehall
whitewash. For the cognoscenti, little new information has yet emerged, and when the final report is written it will not
seek to apportion blame. Yet beneath the equivocation and mandarin-speak, Whitehall seems, in as much as it knows
how, to be using Chilcot to wield the scalpel. Throughout the first week the pent-up frustrations of diplomats and career
civil servants over the way Tony Blair <http://www.guardian.co.uk/pclitics/tonyblair> and George Bush secretly plotted
to oust Saddam Hussein; bypassing the "official channels" in which they operate, has been there for all to see.
Chilcot is said to have been warned by his Whitehall friends that many witnesses will be ready to unburden themselves -
finally to take revenge. In session after session they have appeared to do that. Blair's reputation has been sliced like
salami day after day.
Sir William Ehrman, the Foreign Office's former director of international security, volunteered last Wednesday that the
threat from Saddam's supposed weapons of mass destruction was known to be limited.
In the gentlest way he drove in the dagger. "We did, I think on 10 March [2003], get a report that chemical weapons
might have remained disassembled and Saddam hadn't yet ordered their assembly. There was a suggestion that Iraq
might lack warheads capable of effective dispersal of agents."
Ever the diplomat, however, Ehrman went on to say that the intelligence warnings had not made any difference to the
case for war. "I don't think it invalidated the point about the programMes he had. It was more about use," he said. But
he had set the tone.
On Thursday, Sir Christopher Meyer, UK ambassador in Washington from 1997 to 2003, who has already criticised the
government over Iraq in his memoirs, went for Blair, mercilessly comparing his qualities as a war leader to those of
Margaret Thatcher. "I'm not trying to make a party political point here whatsoever, but quite often I think about this:
what would Margaret Thatcher have done?" Meyer asked. "I think she would have insisted on a coherent political and
diplomatic strategy and she would have demanded the greatest clarity about what the heck happened if, and when, you
removed Saddam Hussein."

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766974 Date: 07/31/2015
A former press secretary to John Major who can speak like a mandarin but, equally, can talk like a layman, he said Blair
had failed miserably to extract a price from George Bush for his loyalty. "We could have achieved more by playing a
tougher role... if, for example... Tony Blair had said: 'I want to help you, George, on this, but I have to say, in all honesty,
that I will not be able to take part in any military operation unless we have palpable progress on the [Middle East] peace
process and we have absolute clarity on what happens in Iraq if it comes up.' I think that would have changed the nature
— it would not have led to a rupture — it would have changed the nature of American planning. "
Even when defending UK policy, he was on the offensive. Asked if policy had been adapted to stay in line with
Washington's, Meyer added: "I wouldn't say it was as extremely poodle-ish as that."
On Friday, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's former ambassador to the United Nations, told Chilcot he had threatened to
resign in 2002 if at least one security council resolution was not passed. He added: "I regard our participation in the
military action in Iraq in March 2003 as legal but of questionable legitimacy, in that it did not have the democratically
observable backing of the great majority of [UN] member states, or even perhaps of the majority of people inside the
UK."
Today new arguments are raging over whether the inquiry will have access to, and publish, the most sensitive
documents — including legal advice given to the government by the former attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, during the
lead-up to war. Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader, has written to Gordon Brown saying that, unless all such
material is published, the inquiry will be a sham and the public's sense that it has been denied the facts will remain.
But it will still be essential viewing nonetheless. This week will see more key witnesses. The most revealing testimony
could come tomorrow when Sir David Manning, Blair's former foreign policy
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/foreignpolicy> adviser, is certain to be asked about his authorship of a memo
which purportedly revealed details of a secret meeting between Bush and Blair in January 2003. According to reports,
the five pages of secret documents, known as the Manning memo, recorded the White House meeting on 31 January
which allegedly shows that Bush and Blair made a deal to carry cut an invasion regardless of whether weapons of mass
destruction were discovered by UN weapons inspectors. It appears to be in direct contradiction with statements that
Blair made to parliament afterwards that Saddam would be given a final chance to disarm.
The memo also disclosed that Bush floated the idea of painting a U-2 spyplane in UN colours and letting it fly low over
Iraq to provoke Saddam into ordering it to be shot down, providing a pretext for the subsequent invasion by America
and Britain.
Manning, educated at Oriel College, Oxford, and a career diplomat, is fiercely independent. He may choose to say more
than Blair would like, according to one former colleague. He could also be asked to either confirm or deny Meyer's
evidence that Meyer received "new instructions" in early 2005 indicating that it was a "complete waste of time" to
oppose regime change, so strong was the US determination to go down that road.
On Tuesday, Edward Chaplin, the Foreign Office Middle East director at the time of the invasion, and Sir Peter Ricketts,
the top official in the Foreign Office, will appear. Ricketts, a former chairman of Britain's powerful joint intelligence
committee, has already given evidence to the inquiry alleging that officials in London knew even before Bush came to
office in 2001 that there were "voices" in Washington calling for Saddam to be removed from power. Ricketts also told
the inquiry that, until March 2002, Whitehall distanced itself from regime change. Only one month later, Blair told Bush
that he would support military action "to bring about regime change".
According to documents leaked five years ago, Ricketts described the US in 2002 as "scrambling to establish a link
between Iraq and al-Qaida" — a connection that was "so far, frankly unconvincing". On Thursday, Sir Kevin Tebbit, the
Ministry of Defence's permanent secretary during, the invasion, will be asked to give evidence about the military
planning. Chilcot will, most likely, want to know when the government first began to amass resources for the war and
what, if any, preparations were made for the aftermath of an invasion. Tebbit could also be urged to divulge the level of
intelligence he received on the likelihood of an attack with chemical or biological weapons.
After Tebbit, a succession of heavy-hitting military men will give evidence. The former chief of the defence staff, Admiral
the Lord Boyce, could be asked whether he believes that the invasion was legal. On Friday, Lieutenant General Sir
Anthony Pigott, former deputy chief of the defence staff, and Major General David Wilson, senior British military adviser
to the US military's central command between 2002 and 2003, will be questioned about military planning for the
conflict.
The last witness to appear this week will be Dominic Asquith, Britain's ambassador to Iraq between 2006 and 2007, who
will come armed with knowledge of the view from Baghdad.
When Chilcot has made his way through the officials, he will turn in the new year to former ministers, including Jack
Straw, the former foreign secretary, and Blair himself. The panel has said that it will also begin to examine the highly

controversial issue of whether the invasion was legal — which may turn out to be the focal point of the whole inquiry — in
January.
In his final report, which is not expected until late 2010 at the earliest, Chilcot has said he will not seek to attribute
blame. But after only one week it is already clear where much of Whitehall believes that lies.

Afghanistan: The speech you'll miss
By Jim Hoagland
Sunday, November 29, 2009
Dec. 1, 2009:
My fellow Americans,
This is not the speech you expected to hear. But my wordsmiths are tied in knots writing an acceptance speech for the
only Nobel Peace Prize ever awarded for making speeches. So I am going to tell you how I really feel about Afghanistan.
Which is: steamed.
I want to accomplish three goals tonight without naming them.
First, to let those know-it-alls, Generals Petraeus and McChrystal, know one more thing: This is the last big troop
increase you get, so make it work.
I am not going down the incrementalist road that wrecked Lyndon Johnson's presidency. This is not July 1965, when
Westmoreland jumped the shark of escalation in Vietnam and then never stopped asking for more troops. For all the
trouble he has been, Dick Holbrooke helped by recalling that history in the shadowboxing that dominated my long war
council meetings.
Joe Biden has been good in there, too. He's been willing, though not happy, to be characterized in the media as being
ready to bug out now. This helped us push back against McChrystal's effort to box me in at 40,000 additional U.S.
soldiers.
Denis McDonough, my strategic communications man, sold Biden-as-dove brilliantly. Wasn't somebody just saying I
should promote Denis? Maybe it was Denis?
Never mind. That tactic won me room to maneuver toward a more realistic number of, say, 23,000 new combat troops,
5,000 additional trainers and a "NATO surge" of 5,000 foreign troops.
That's my second unspoken goal: to come out of this buildup speech without losing the left of the Democratic Party --
while being able to refute John McCain's charges that I ignored my own generals. Triangulation lives.
Bush put the generals in the limelight to sell the Iraq surge after he lost all credibility, and David Petraeus's performance
was dazzling. Which presents two big problems. Petraeus is the only person who could get the Republican nomination in
2012 and make a serious run against me. (I get paid to think ahead.) And if the generals box me in, civilian control of the
military in this country becomes a mockery. Clinton was afraid of the military; Bush was deep in hock to it. I've got to get
the right balance back.
That's why I need Bob Gates and Jim Jones. Those who scoffed at my keeping on Bush's defense secretary, and then
making a retired Marine four-star I hardly knew my NSC guy, were not thinking that moments like this would come. I
already was.
Gates has maneuvered flawlessly through my waterboarding-by-leaks on Afghanistan. He will sell my final number to the
uniforms as the "floor" for U.S. troops that Petraeus argues we need for three years. But Gates knows I will make it a
ceiiing.
We can't afford an open-ended commitment. I put Peter Orszag, as good a budget overseer as you can find, front and
center for the photographers in that last war council. Many missed it, but NBC's Andrea Mitchell got it right away. No
wonder she's married to Alan Greenspan.
I will bet that Stan McChrystal never drew up a budget in his life.
Jones tells me these Special Operations commanders are used to getting whatever they ask for, especially since
September 11th. Nobody on the Hill will deny them anything.
Jones is also squeezing the Europeans to join the battle and is getting results, even from the Germans. What is it Jones
says? Maybe the worst thing of all would be to be perceived to lose in Afghanistan and then have the Europeans say:
Well, you never asked for more help at the crucial time. Makes sense to me.
We have sent NATO members the numbers we think they can and should provide, country by country. That new
secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, is pulling out the stops, visiting the capitals to get commitments.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766974 Date: 07/31/2015
"Say it now, pay it later," we tell the Europeans. They have until mid-2010 to deploy their new units. But I need pledges
now so I can get across tonight that this is NATO's war, not Obama's war. That's unspoken-goal number three.
So I have frontloaded the speech with allusions to this being about an exit strategy, without boxing myself in on timing,
and am presenting the "civilian surge" as being as essential as the troop buildup. That helps set up my Oslo speech. And
who knows? It may even work out that way. If God blesses us all.

Re: Saudi Arabia
I have been in contact with Chas Freeman, former ambassador to Saudi Arabia, and he has sent me his most
recent public speech on the subject. He says the policy part is toward the end, and that King Abdullah's new
university (KAUST) is an important initiative. He also relates that the atmosphere is near toxic because of
Obama's failure to follow up his Cairo speech and the rebuff from Netanyahu. Cynicism, at best, is pervasive
among the Saudi elite.
Saudi Arabia: The End of Progress without Change
Remarks to the Sarasota Institute for Lifetime Learning
Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.)
Sarasota, Florida, February 11, 2010
I have been asked to speak to you about the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This is a topic I have never before
addressed to an American audience. Why bother?
We Americans reserve the right to have strong opinions on the basis of little or no knowledge. There are few
countries that better exemplify our assertive ignorance of foreign geography, history, and culture than Saudi
Arabia. Most of us are convinced that Saudis are Muslim zealots, control the world's oil prices, and are
absurdly rich, anti-feminist, and undemocratic. They hate our values and want to destroy us. Talk radio
confirms this. What more needs to be said?

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767140 Date: 08/31/2015
On reflection, a lot does. Neither caricature nor a priori reasoning is a sound basis for policy. A distorted view
of foreign realities precludes success at dealing with them. There is much at stake in our relationship with
Saudi Arabia. We can ill afford to get it wrong.
That country is, of course, the heartland of Islam and the custodian of the world's largest oil reserves. It lies
athwart transport routes between Asia, Europe, and A.frica. It is at the center of a. growing concentration of
global capital. tinder any circumstances, the .Kingdom of Saudi Arabia NV cut important. It is all the more
so in an era when we Americans are at war with ever more peoples in the Islamic world, depend on ever greater
amounts of imported energy, and need ever larger foreign loans to Mil our government and sustain our life
style.
Yet Saudi Arabia is little known.. It is the only society on the planet not to have been penetrated by Western
colonialism. No European armies breached its borders; no missionaries; no merchants. Its capital, Riyadh, was
long off limits to infidels; the holy cities of Mecca and Medini. remain so to;:lay. 'When Westeriaers finally came
to Saudi Arabia, we came not as the vindicators of our presumed cultural superiority, but as hired help. As a
result, some say that Saudis secretly see the world's peoples as divided into two basic categories: (1) fellow
Saudis; and (2) potentitA employees. 'Be that as it may, foreigners, Western, Asian, or /krab, who have lived in
SLiudi Arabi.a all see it as a -very strange place — one that is riot easy to itnclerstand and that remains at odds with
many of the values non-Saudis profess.
The Kingdom has long stood apart from global norms. Its system of government draws on tribal and Islamic
traditions rather than Western models. Its king presides rather than rules over the royal family and Saudi
society. His responsibility is less to make decisions than to shape and proclaim consensus, while assuring a
share of the national wealth to all. especially the leas;. 1ri.A.7ilege(. Saudi Arabia levies no taxes 011 t S citizens,
other than the religious tithe known as "zakat" a two-and-a-half percent annual donation of private capital to

pursue these sen, ices at home of abroad.. as they wish. The Kingdom has no parliament. though it does have

"progress without change." But in fact change is a constant in Saudi Arabia. Most of it comes from the top
down.
Not all Saudis are happy with the status quo. Some are angry about the extent to which the Kingdom is opening
up and reforming. Others are impatient to get on with reform. The ranks of the latter clearly include King
Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al-Sa'ud, the current ruler. Now in his late eighties and on the throne only since 2005,
he has surprised everyone with the vigor of his efforts to modernize Saudi society and to reshape its
relationships with the world beyond its borders. Saudi Arabia has plenty of problems to keep the king engaged.
A lot of issues derive from the peculiar religious heritage of the Saudi state, The current Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia (now over a century old) is the third political structure to ally the House of Sa'ud with the family of the
eighteenth century religious reformer Shaykh al Islam Mohammed ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab Al-Tanaimi. Ibn 'Abd
al-Wahhab's writings form the doctrinal basis of so-called Wahliabis-m, a notoriously intolerant and socially
conservative form of Islam -that is often confused with other reactionary religious traditions like that of the
Taliban. Saudi history has Mvolved a sustained efibrt by the Kingdom's rulers to persuade us religious scholars
and their puritanical followers to embrace change and to open up to the outside world. This struggle has mainly
been peaceful and virtually invisible to outsiders. Sometimes, however, it has engendered violence. In 1975,
for example, .the late King Faisal paid with his life for instituting public education for 2fris and for introducing
television to his nation.
Both as -regent (from 1996 to 2005) and more recently as ruler, King Abdullah has been so careful to avoid
drama in his promotion of change that it is truly startling to review the cumulative results of his
leadership. Take women's issues, for example. In 2002, responsibility for girls' education was transferred from
the religious authorities to the ministry of education. Women now make up 58 percent of the enrollment in
Saudi universities. The new Princess Noun ii 'Pint Abduirahmari University for Women, currently Wider
construction in Riyadh, will enroll 40,000 students this fall.
Female participation in the labor force is rising rapidly. Twenty-nine percent of women now work outside the
home. (That is a low figure compared to our own but represents a remarkable advance for the Kingdom.) One-
-third of civil service positions have !peen reserved -for women. The first woman took her seat i.n the Co modof
Ministers hist year. After a bit cilia kerfuffie, the .I',.iingdom's religious scholars ifinally endorsed coeducation at
the new King Abdullah Univershv for Science and Technology. That was big blow to the 'legitimacy of gender
apartheid. A Saudi friend and I are betting that it will not be long before women in the Kingdom can drive. We
plan to clean up by building the separate road system tins may require. (That's a joke, I hope,)
A word about the vision embodied in the King Abdullah University for Science and Technology. Founded by
the king last Septernber with an initial endowment of ten billion dollars. KAUST is an international, graduate-
level research university. It sits in a two-billion-dollar campus on the Red Sea about seventy-five miles
northwest of Mecca. On one level, it is the leading element in an effort to prepare the Kingdom for a
knowledge-based economy that can complement and eventually supercede the current reliance on energy
exports. But on another level, it is a powerful answer to the religious zealotry that terrorist movements like al
Qa'ida espouse. Let me explain.
There is a broad consensus among the world's 1.6 billion Muslims that the modern age is ethically corrupt and
that religious faith needs reinvigoration and renewal. Much like early Christian Protestants, many believe that
the way to achieve this is to rediscover and reaffirm the values of their religion's earliest times. When he
inaugurated KAUST, King Abdullah explained that he envisaged it as a reborn Bayt al-Hikma or "House of
Wisdom." The original "House of Wisdom" was founded in Baghdad around 760 CE., in the second century of
the Muslim era. It was where the Arabs incorporated Greek, Indian and other foreign knowledge into Islam and
conceived much of modern mathematics, astronomy, medicine, chemistry, zoology, and geography. It made
Islamic civilization the global leader in science and technology. The "House of Wisdom" prospered in an age
of tolerance, when Jews and Christians served alongside Muslims as ministers of government. Though

destroyed by the Mongols in 1258, the knowledge it preserved and developed eventually found its way to
Europe, where it sparked the Renaissance.
Today, like mainstream Muslims, the extremists of al Qa'ida and related movements argue that Islam must
return to its roots. But they portray early Islam as puritanical, xenophobic, intolerant, and oppressive of
women.. KAUST is a living rebuttal of this historical fallacy and the ideology of hatred derived from it. It was
conceived as a new "House of Wisdom." It stands for the principle that Islam was founded as and can only be
reborn as the religious guide to a society open to ideas from other traditions. It represents a call for return to an
Islam tolerant of foreign ways, respectful of women, dedicated to the scientific study of God's handiwork, and
committed to the development of new technologies to better the human condition. KAUST is as much an
instrument of religious renaissance and an answer to extremism as it is an academic institution.
This brings me to the issue of religious tolerance. In 2003, King Abdullah inaugurated what he called a
"national forum for intellectual dialogue." This ongoing national dialogue is an unprecedented acceptance of
religious diversity in the Kingdom. It marks an end to longstanding official discrimination against its Shiite
minority. In 2007, King Abdullah made an historic call on the Pope in the Vatican, the first time a Muslim
leader of his stature had done so. In 2008 he organized two unprecedented international interfaith conferences
between Muslims, Jews, Christians. Buddhists, and others at Madrid and New York. He intends this dialogue,
too, to be a continuing process.
There are other major domestic reform initiatives in progress, like a complete revamping of the Saudi
educational system and curriculum, experiments with elections at lower levels of government and civil society,
efforts to shift the Kingdom toward reliance on alternative sources of energy, the development of a huge new
petrochemical industry to complement the production of energy in its primary form. Time will not permit me to
describe these developments. My point is simply that there is a great deal more going on in Saudi Arabia than
our press and pundits seem to realize.
That said, everything is, of course, relative. Sadly, to many Saudis, the history of their nation suggests that the
more religiously uptight they are, the more oil comes out of the ground. The Kingdom continues in many ways
to belie God's admonition in the Holy ()limn that "there can be no compulsion in religion." The open practice
of religions other than Islam remains banned. The status and role of wonien in &tudi society is controversial
and far from settled. Despite efforts at "Saudiization," foreign workers continue to dominate the employment
market, while demanding a premium to compensate for the discomfort and stress that Saudi Arabia's religiously
sanctioned mores impose on them. Methods of political consultation that worked in a more cohesive and less
populous Saudi Arabia can no longer produce consensus. The fiscal basis of the state continues to be oil
exports, and oil is a commodity whose price fluctuates unpredictably. There is, in other words, a very long list
of problems for Saudis to work out in coming years.
Let me turn briefly to Saudi Arabia's foreign relations before reviewing the state of our country's interaction
with it.
In foreign even more than domestic affairs, King Abdullah's impact has been little short of revolutionary. He
has overseen the negotiated settlement of the Kingdom's long-disputed borders with all of its neighbors. He
brought Saudi Arabia into the World Trade Organization, ensuring that its trade arid investment activities for the
first time follow internationally agreed rules. In 1982, at Beirut, he led the Arab League in an historic reversal.
of policy toward the Israel-Palestine issue. Saudi Arabia had long insisted that it would be the last state in the
region to recognize and establish relations with Israel. At Beirut, King Abdullah committed to be the first to
normalize relations with Israel upon its achievement of a mutually acceptable arrangement for coexistence with
the Palestinians. He persuaded all other Arab countries to promise they would do the same. To his great
frustration. Israel did not respond. Since then, hope for a two-state solution that could gain acceptance for Israel
in the region has dimmed.

Many of Saudi Arabia's foreign policy challenges stem from recent American policies in the region. These
policies have had the effect of liberating Israel from all constraints on its settlement activities and belligerent
intervention in its Arab neighbors, installing Iran as the dominant political influence in both Iraq and Lebanon,
consolidating rather than eroding the Syrian-Iranian alliance, pushing Hama.s into the arms of the Iranians, and
raising regional tensions over Tehran's nuclear program while doing nothing effective about it. Then there is
Afghanistan, where the United States now seems to be engaged in a crusade against militant Islam — one that
many in the region now fear may soon extend to Yemen. Saudi counter-terrorism specialists, Who have a well-
deserved international reputation for effectiveness, are convinced that the most efficient way to radicalize
Muslim populations and encourage terrorism against the United States and its foreign policy partners is to
invade, occupy, and humiliate them. They believe that the panick.ed militarism of the U.S. response to 9/11 was
exactly what groups like al Qa'ida, hoped for. They see no sign that the United States is about to abandon
actions and policies that metastasize extremism and stimulate terrorist reprisal against Americans and our
foreign friends.
No longer willing to be publicly associated with U.S. policies in the Holy Land, Iraq, Afghanistan, and
elsewhere that radicalize the region and menace the Kingdom's own security, Saudi Arabia is actively
attempting to reduce its historic dependence on America. To this end, it is building new relationships with
countries like China, India, and. Russia, while strengthening cooperation with longstanding partners in Europe
and Asia like Britain, France, Germany, japan, and south Korea. It is not that the Kingdom has given up on the
United States. As the king's scholarship program for Saudi students in this country evidences., Saudi Arabia
continues to reach out and seek improved relations with America. But Saudis no longer trust us to take their
interests into account or to protect them from their enemies.
In December 2002, as the U.S. prepared to invade Iraq against the forcefully expressed advice of then Crown
Prince Abdullab, Saudi Aramco (the world's largest oil company) quietly abandoned a decades-old subsidy for
the cost of shipping oil to the North American market. Within months, China replaced the United States as the
Kingdom's biggest overseas market for oil. U.S. exports have remained relatively constant as the Saudi
Arabian economy has boomed, dramatically' reducing our market share in our largest Middle Eastern
market. Ironically, the best element of the US-Saudi relationship is now cooperation against terrorists. This is a
task in which the Saudis have perforce learned to excel. American policies ensure an endless supply of angry
young Muslim men in the region, including in Saudi Arabia.
The United States is now said to have entered a "long war." The last time we did so, in 1947 with Soviet
Communism„ the enemy was obvious, George Ketman gave us a strategy, and skillful American diplomacy
gave us the allies we needed to pursue it. Kennan's "long telegram" from Moscow outlined a comprehensive
approach to the political, economic, cultural, and military containment of the threat to our survival and our
values posed by the Soviet Union. We followed his outline. Forty years later, as Kerman forecast, without our
having to go to war with the USSR, ohr Soviet enemy collapsed of its own infirmities.
This time, our "long war" is with various Islamic extremists, tribes, sects, and societies. Were not quite sure
who our enemy is. No K.ennan has emerged to give us a strategy for winning without fighting or, indeed, any
"strategy" at all. Instead, we are flailing about with our superbly lethal military in response to events. Lacking
a strategy, we have been unable to recruit foreign partners to support one. We are now alone in Iraq. We are
isolated internationally on the Israel-Palestine issue. Our NATO allies are with us in Afghanistan out of
consideration for NATO, not because they think we know what we are doing. Many of them have already
announced their intention to withdraw-. Pakistan is with us only because all its alternatives are worse.
Saudi Arabia and America head al Qa•ida'S enemies list. The Kingdom has, however, been successfully vilified
in the eyes of the American elite and public. To deal effectively with Islamic extremism, we need Muslim
allies. There is none more potent that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Yet we have made no effort to seek its
advice about how to address the challenges of Islamic extremism. We have not sought its help to legitimize an

effective political, informational, cultural, and economic strategy for productive engagement with the Islamic
world.
Meanwhile, however, many things now happening in the Kingdom — like the implicit message of the king's
vision for KAUST — suggest that such a partnership with Saudi Arabia and Arab nations of like mind is
possible. Such a partnership could be the basis for a strategy to bring victory- in this latest "long war." The
common interests on which to forge an alliance are clearlY there. Last June in Cairo, President Obama
brilliantly articulated a credible basis for sound relations with the Islamic world. His vision was persuasive, but
it remains a mirage, not a reality. Et is past time to implement it. An intensive effort to reset the relationship
with Saudi Arabia and to craft a common antiterrorist strategy with its king would be a good place to start.

Re: Saudi Arabia
I have been in contact with Chas Freeman, former ambassador to Saudi Arabia, and he has sent
me his most recent public speech on the subject. He says the policy part is toward the end, and
that King Abdullah's new university (KAUST) is an important initiative. He also relates that the
atmosphere is near toxic because of Obama's failure to follow up his Cairo speech and the rebuff
from Netanyahu. Cynicism, at best, is pervasive among the Saudi elite.
Saudi Arabia: The End of Progress without Change
Remarks to the Sarasota Institute for Lifetime Learning
Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.)
Sarasota, Florida, February 11, 2010
I have been asked to speak to you about the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This is a topic I have
never before addressed to an American audience. Why bother?
We Americans reserve the right to have strong opinions on the basis of little or no knowledge.
There are few countries that better exemplify our assertive ignorance of foreign geography,
history, and culture than Saudi Arabia. Most of us are convinced that Saudis are Muslim zealots,
control the world's oil prices, and are absurdly rich, anti-feminist, and undemocratic. They hate
our values and want to destroy us. Talk radio confirms this. What more needs to be said?
On reflection, a lot does. Neither caricature nor a priori reasoning is a sound basis for policy. A
distorted view of foreign realities precludes success at dealing with them. There is much at stake
in our relationship with Saudi Arabia. We can ill afford to get it wrong.

That country is, of course, the heartland of Islam and the custodian of the world's largest oil
reserves. It lies athwart transport routes between Asia, Europe, and Africa. It is at the center of
a growing concentration of global capital. Under any circumstances, the Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia would be important. It is all the more so in an era when we Americans are at war with
ever more peoples in the Islamic world, depend on ever greater amounts of imported energy, and
need ever larger foreign loans to run our government and sustain our life style.
Yet Saudi Arabia is little known. It is the only society on the planet not to have been penetrated
by Western colonialism. No European armies breached its borders; no missionaries; no
merchants. Its capital, Riyadh, was long off limits to infidels; the holy cities of Mecca and
Medina remain so today. When Westerners finally came to Saudi Arabia, we came not as the
vindicators of our presumed cultural superiority, but as hired help. As a result, some say that
Saudis secretly see the world's peoples as divided into two basic categories: (1) fellow Saudis;
and (2) potential employees. Be that as it may, foreigners, Western, Asian, or Arab, who have
lived in Saudi Arabia all see it as a very strange place — one that is not easy to understand and
that remains at odds with many of the values non-Saudis profess.
The Kingdom has long stood apart from global norms. Its system of government draws on tribal
and Islamic traditions rather than Western models. Its king presides rather than rules over the
royal family and Saudi society. His responsibility is less to make decisions than to shape and
proclaim consensus, while assuring a share of the national wealth to all, especially the least
privileged. Saudi Arabia levies no taxes on its citizens, other than the religious tithe known as
"zakat" — a two-and-a-half percent annual donation of private capital to charity and other public
purposes. All Saudis enjoy free education and medical care from birth to death and can pursue
these services at home or abroad, as they wish. The Kingdom has no parliament, though it does
have elaborate informal mechanisms for consultation with its citizens on policy matters. Saudi
Arabia reverses and thereby affirms a basic principle of American political philosophy. "No
representation without taxation."
Unlike some other countries in the Arab Gulf, Saudi Arabia has invested its oil wealth at home,
not abroad, though it has long been generous with foreign aid. (At one point it was donating six
percent of GDP to other, mostly Muslim, nations.) The desperate poverty of the pre-oil period is
now, at most, a dim memory. Over the lifetime of elderly Saudis, the Kingdom's per capita
income has risen about one hundred fold. Sparsely populated mud-walled villages have grown
into huge air-conditioned cities with 21' Century architecture. Today, Saudis are not just
literate; many have university degrees. There are more U.S. Ph.D.'s in the Saudi Cabinet than in
our Cabinet and Congress put together.
Despite rapid development, the strong family structure that characterized traditional Saudi
society has remained largely intact. It is truly moving to see how lovingly children and
grandchildren care for their elders in the Kingdom. Saudi Arabia's unique social stability is
reflected in the fact that almost none of its citizens emigrate, though many have second homes
abroad, and a few, like Osama Binladin, have been exiled for deviant behavior.
For a long time it was easier for journalists and academics to get a visa to Tibet than to Saudi
Arabia. Perhaps this accounts for the near total lack of institutions and scholars that study the

place. In the United States, 9/11 was followed by an avalanche of polemical tracts, but there are
still very few books about the Kingdom that reflect its realities rather than the authors' biases or

A word about the vision embodied in the King Abdullah University for Science and
Technology. Founded by the king last September with an initial endowment of ten billion
dollars, KAUST is an international, graduate-level research university. It sits in a two-billion-
dollar campus on the Red Sea about seventy-five miles northwest of Mecca. On one level, it is
the leading element in an effort to prepare the Kingdom for a knowledge-based economy that can
complement and eventually supercede the current reliance on energy exports. But on another

of energy in its primary form. Time will not permit me to describe these developments. My

Afghanistan, where the United States now seems to be engaged in a crusade against militant
Islam — one that many in the region now fear may soon extend to Yemen. Saudi counter-
terrorism specialists, who have a well-deserved international reputation for effectiveness, are
convinced that the most efficient way to radicalize Muslim populations and encourage terrorism
against the United States and its foreign policy partners is to invade, occupy, and humiliate
them. They believe that the panicked militarism of the U.S. response to 9/11 was exactly what
groups like al Qa'ida hoped for. They see no sign that the United States is about to abandon

actions and policies that metastasize extremism and stimulate terrorist reprisal against Americans
and our foreign friends.
No longer willing to be publicly associated with U.S. policies in the Holy Land, Iraq,
Afghanistan, and elsewhere that radicalize the region and menace the Kingdom's own security,
Saudi Arabia is actively attempting to reduce its historic dependence on America. To this end, it
is building new relationships with counties like China, India, and Russia, while strengthening
cooperation with longstanding partners in Europe and Asia like Britain, France, Germany, Japan,
and south Korea. It is not that the Kingdom has given up on the United States. As the king's
scholarship program for Saudi students in this country evidences, Saudi Arabia continues to
reach out and seek improved relations with America. But Saudis no longer trust us to take their
interests into account or to protect them from their enemies.
In December 2002, as the U.S. prepared to invade Iraq against the forcefully expressed advice of
then Crown Prince Abdullah, Saudi Aramco (the world's largest oil company) quietly abandoned
a decades-old subsidy for the cost of shipping oil to the North American market. Within months,
China replaced the United States as the Kingdom's biggest overseas market for oil. U.S. exports
have remained relatively constant as the Saudi Arabian economy has boomed, dramatically
reducing our market share in our largest Middle Eastern market. Ironically, the best element of
the US-Saudi relationship is now cooperation against terrorists. This is a task in which the
Saudis have perforce learned to excel. American policies ensure an endless supply of angry
young Muslim men in the region, including in Saudi Arabia.
The United States is now said to have entered a "long war." The last time we did so, in 1947
with Soviet Communism, the enemy was obvious, George Kerman gave us a strategy, and
skillful American diplomacy gave us the allies we needed to pursue it. Kennan's "long
telegram" from Moscow outlined a comprehensive approach to the political, economic, cultural,
and military containment of the threat to our survival and our values posed by the Soviet Union.
We followed his outline. Forty years later, as Kennan forecast, without our having to go to war
with the USSR, our Soviet enemy collapsed of its own infirmities.
This time, our "long war" is with various Islamic extremists, tribes, sects, and societies. We're
not quite sure who our enemy is. No Kennan has emerged to give us a strategy for winning
without fighting or, indeed, any "strategy" at all. Instead, we are flailing about with our superbly
lethal military in response to events. Lacking a strategy, we have been unable to recruit foreign
partners to support one. We are now alone in Iraq. We are isolated internationally on the Israel-
Palestine issue. Our NATO allies are with us in Afghanistan out of consideration for NATO, not
because they think we know what we are doing. Many of them have already announced their
intention to withdraw. Pakistan is with us only because all its alternatives are worse.
Saudi Arabia and America head al Qa'ida's enemies list. The Kingdom has, however, been
successfully vilified in the eyes of the American elite and public. To deal effectively with
Islamic extremism, we need Muslim allies. There is none more potent that the Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia. Yet we have made no effort to seek its advice about how to address the challenges
of Islamic extremism. We have not sought its help to legitimize an effective political,

informational, cultural, and economic strategy for productive engagement with the Islamic
world.
Meanwhile, however, many things now happening in the Kingdom — like the implicit message of
the king's vision for KAUST — suggest that such a partnership with Saudi Arabia and Arab
nations of like mind is possible. Such a partnership could be the basis for a strategy to bring
victory in this latest "long war." The common interests on which to forge an alliance are clearly
there. Last June in Cairo, President Obama brilliantly articulated a credible basis for sound
relations with the Islamic world. His vision was persuasive, but it remains a mirage, not a
reality. It is past time to implement it. An intensive effort to reset the relationship with Saudi
Arabia and to craft a common antiterrorist strategy with its king would be a good place to start.

More than a million spectators gathered before the Capitol on a frosty January afternoon to witness the inauguration of
Barad< Obama, who promised in his campaign to change Washington's mercenary culture of lobbyists, special interest
influence and backroom deals. But within a few months of being sworn in, the President and his top aides were sitting
down with leaders from the pharmaceutical industry to hash out a deal that they thought would make health care reform
possible.
Over the following months, pharmaceutical industry lobbyists and executives met with top White House aides dozens of
times to hammer out a deal that would secure industry support for the administration's health care reform agenda in
exchange for the White House abandoning key elements of the president's promises to reform the pharmaceutical
industry. They flooded Congress with campaign contributions, and hired dozens of former Capitol Hill insiders to push
their case. How they did it--pieced together from news accounts, disclosure forms including lobbying reports and Federal
Election Commission records, White House visitor logs and the sghedu! ..S,:::in. Max,Baucus releases yoiun:tarily--is a
testament to how ingrained the grip of special interests remains in Washington.
In the 2008 campaign, Obama declared his intention to include all stakeholders as he sought to reform the nation's health
care system, but also supported key qemocr.atic health reform uok,
sies. Among these were several that targeted the
pharmaceutical industry: Allowing re-importation of drugs from first world countries with lower drug prices and providing
Medicare with negotiating authority over prescription drug prices in the recently enacted Part D program. These weren't
just promises, Obama had already voted for both of them as a senator in 2007. (Rdl Call Vote 132 and Roll call Vo.t.c.-)
150.)
Set to carry out this agenda were two Capitol Hill veterans, schooled in the monied Washington culture, chief of staff
Rahm Emanuel and deputy chief of staff Jim Messina. Emanuel was a former fundraiser, Clinton administration official,
investment banker and member of the Democratic leadership in Congress. Messina was the former campaign manager

and chief of staff to the powerful Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus. Both were known for their
unparalleled legislative abilities.
Because of Obama's decision to develop a plan operating through the legislative process, members of Congress also
played key roles. Early on, the pharmaceutical companies were told to deal directly with Senate Finance Committee
chairman Max Bpuf.
-4:s. Baucus would be the vehicle for the deal worked out behind the scenes by the White House and
PhRMA.
Central to this effort was PhRMA president, CEO and top lobbyist Billy Tauzin, a longtime Democratic member of
Congress who switched party affiliations after Republicans gained control of Congress in 1994. By switching parties
Tauzin was able to maintain his influence and even rose to be Chairman of the House Committee on Energy &
Commerce. Tauzin became the poster child of Washington's mercenary culture. He crafted a bill to provide prescription
drug access to Medicare recipients, one that provided major concessions to the pharmaceutical industry. Medicare would
not be able to negotiate for lower prescription drug costs and reimportation of drugs from first world countries would not be
allowed. A few months after the bill passed, Tauzin announced that he was retiring from Congress and would be taking a
job helming PhRMA for a salary of $2 million.
Tauzin's job change became fodder for a campaign ad that then presidential candidate Barack Obama ran in the spring of
2008 simply titled ".Biliy." It featured the candidate, sleeves rolled up, talking to a salon of gasping Americans about the
ways of Washington. "The pharmaceutical industry wrote into the prescription drug plan that Medicare could not negotiate
with drug companies. And you know what, the chairman of the committee, who pushed the law through, went to work for
the pharmaceutical industry making $2 million a year." The screen fades to black to inform the viewer that, "Barack
Obama is the only candidate who refuses Washington lobbyist money," while the candidate continues his lecture,
"Imagine that. That's an example of the same old game playing in Washington. You know, I don't want to learn how to
play the game better, I want to put an end to the game playing."
Aiding PhRMA in their outreach to Congress would be a squadron of lobbyists to push their health care reform priorities.
Over the course of 2009, the drug industry trade group sdeft:tow::!i: _ 520 tniliion on in house and hired lobbyists. Aside from
PhRMA's massive in-house lobbying operation, the trade group hired 48 outside lobbying firms. The total number of
lobbyists working for PhRMA in 2009 reached 165. Some 137 of those 165 lobbyists representing PhRMA were former
employees of either the legislative or executive branches. Of these dozens were former congressional staffers including
two former chiefs of staff to Max Baucus.
According to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, drug makers coptr.ibu■ed sums to ....:ongressional
ecii-om.lttee.s during the same period--from January to the end of October (4thquarter numbers are still being
totaled), industry political action committees, employees and their family members flooded lawmakers with over $8 million.
Those contributions tilted heavily to Democrats over Republicans by a 57 to 42 percent margin--the first time in any
election cycle going back to 1990, the first year that the Center for Responsive Politics began tracking industry giving, that
Democrats were so favored. Given their majorities on Capitol Hill, and the new President's intention to reform America's
health care system, the new tilt was perhaps not surprising.
On March 5, the White House a Tee.tiilfa....ivitfi.rnnic!r_nealth care induLd.er.s to try to bring them to the table and
see what could be done to gain their support. In attendance were Billy Tauzin, president, CEO and top lobbyist for

Chamber of Commerce and Robert Wood Johnson Foundations' Rise Lavizzomourey. A day before the White House

problems but was glad to have a chance to discuss these. Spme were duri?0,7rognnd,,
,td by this apparent change of
heart on behalf of an industry long adverse to health care reforms.
On April 15, Jim Messina and Jon Selib, chief of staff to Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus, convened a
meeting at the headquarters of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) with leaders of organized labor
and health care groups, including PhRMA. At the meeting, the groups decided to form two nonprofit entities to promote
reform efforts, Healthy Economy Now and Americans for Stable Quality Care, that would be almost entftelv funoed pj
.
PhRMA. The two groups spent $24 million on their advertising campaigns; the contract to produce and place ads went to
White House Senior Advisor David AKPD, which owed Axelrod $2 million.
In the next month, CEO's from pharmaceutical companies would meet with Baucus and administration officials at least
four times. These talks preceded a major public event at the White House, one critical to its strategy to promote health
care reform. On May 11, PhRMA and other trade industry groups piedaed cost ,
..-v_itting_measures to the White House that
would save, they claimed, upwards of $2 trillion over the next decade. President Obama announced the deal in the State
Dining Room, flanked by leaders of the various trade groups; the administration followed up with a media blitz in the press
and on the White House Web site.
The next day, Healthy Economy Now's PhRMA funded ad campaign ran their first advertisement in support of the health
care reform process calling for the government to finally "fix" the nation's health care cost problems. While many elements
of the $2 trillion cost cutting pledge fell apart, the drug industry remained committed to the process in the hopes that they
could ultimately win out and defeat the provisions they most feared in closed-door meetings with the White House:
The first occurred on June 2. White House visitor logs show PhRMA's top executives, including Tauzin, and industry
CEOs met with Sarah Fenn from the White House Office of Health Care Reform. On the same day, the publicly available

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767164 Date: 08/31/2015
schedule of Senator Max Baucus shows Tauzin and the same industry CEOs met the Senate Finance Committee
chairman. What ultimately resulted from these coordinated meetings would be revealed by Baucus on June 20.
In a press release featuring a statement by Tauzin, Baucus revealed that the pharmaceutical industry had accepted $80
billion in cost cutting measures to be included in the Senate Finance Committee version of the bill. According to news
re_gorts, Baucus initially proposed $100 billion in cost cutting measures, but the executives and lobbyists meeting on June
2 were able to win the lower figure.
The terms of the initial cost-cutting deal included $30 billion go directly towards closing the "donut hole" in Medicare
prescription drug coverage. The "donut hole" is a term for the gap in coverage that occurs within the Medicare prescription
drug coverage. For those purchasing prescription drugs through the Medicare program coverage cuts off at $2,700 spent
and does not pick back up again until $6,154 is spent by the participant. The amount proposed in the deal; 50 percent
coverage for drugs within the coverage gap, however, would not completely close the "donut hole."
In Baucus' press release, Tauzin is quoted as saying, "This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and, working together, we
can make this hope for a better tomorrow a reality today." This "once-in-a-lifetime" opportunity also extended to the
pharmaceutical industry's ability to blunt the long-term Democratic agenda of lowering prescription drug prices through
Medicare negotiations, re-importation and quicker release of generics onto the market. After making such a grand
statement of support through cost cutting proposals it was time for the pharmaceutical industry to finally force the White
House and Democrats to take certain chips off the table.
Baucus proceeded with a_pia,n c.c)r
.ivene.a bicartisap rimuo in an effort to craft the bill desired by the White House.
These participants included Democrats Kent Conrad and Jeff Bingaman and Republicans Chuck Grassley, Mike Enzi and
Olympia Snowe. Baucus' decision and the need to solidify deals with groups like the pharmaceutical industry - which were
reliant on Baucus producing a bill - slowed down the legislative process making it impossible for Congress to meet the
White House's announced iltuouet reces§ dee&rie for passing health care reform.
Soon after, PhRMA's big guns and industry lobbyists paid the White House another visit on July 7 and this time met with
Rehm Emanuel and Jim Messina (Baucus' chief of staff Jon Selib is also listed in White House visitor logs for this
meeting). In August, The Huffirytorj. !Dosi',.
--; Ryan Grim reported on an internal memo that was drafted at that meeting that
outlined the policies that would not be allowed into any final version of health care reform. These included Medicare
prescription drug negotiations, drug re-importation, and the lowering of prices for drugs available through Medicare Part D
and Part B. The deal would be $80 billion in cost cutting and absolutely no more.
***
While the $80 billion deal was cut with Baucus' committee, other congressional committees continued to mark-up their
own versions of health care reform without the knowledge that the White House was relying on Baucus to produce the
final product. In the House of Representatives, the House Energy & Commerce Committee leveled a direct threat to the
$80 billion deal. Energy & Commerce Chair Henry Waxman sought to include all of the provisions that PhRMA had gotten
the White House and Baucus to cut out of the reform bill. These included drug reimportation. Medicare negotiating power
and speedier release of generics to the market. According to previous analysis of the measures proposed by the
committee, these measures would have totaled hundreds of billions in cost cuts, far exceeding the $80 billion cap agreed
to by the White House, Baucus and PhRMA.
The cost cutting measures passed in the Energy & Commerce bill spooked the board of PhRMA, which included all of the
CEOs involved in the deal-cutting meetings with the White House and Baucus. The board pressured Tauzin to go public
with the deal to ensure that the White House would recognize it and not renege. On August 4, the Los Ancg•3les•Firrief-
,
-
:, in
an exclusive report, featured quotes from Tauzin claiming that a deal between the White House and PhRMA existed and
that, as Tauzin put it, "The White House blessed it." Tom Hamburger wrote in the article, "For his part, Tauzin said he had
not only received the White House pledge to forswear Medicare drug price bargaining, but also a separate promise not to
pursue another proposal Obama supported during the campaign: importing cheaper drugs from Canada or Europe."
The White House's Jim Messina later confirmed Tauzin's claim, stating, "The president encouraged this approach ... He
wanted to bring all the parties to the table to discuss health insurance reform."
Democratic lawmakers were furious. Rep. Raul Grijaiva, chairman of the Progressive Caucus, asked, "Are industry groups
going to be the ones at the table who get the first big piece of the pie and we just fight over the crust?"
***
On September 7, Baucus' bill made a private circulation on the Hill; pharmaceutical industry cost-cutting did not exceed
$80 billion. Five days later, the New York :limes reported that PhRMA planned to spend up to $150 million in an
advertising blitz in support of Baucus' bill. The Times noted that the ad spending "...would be a follow-up to the deal that
drug makers struck in June with Mr. Baucus and the White House." On September 16, Baucus released the full text of his
les.j
.islation to the public. t
The White House, PhRMA and Baucus still had to fight a few battles to keep the deal intact. The key amendment
targeting the PhRMA deal in committee mark-up came from Sen. Bill Nelson from Florida, which has one of the largest
Medicare participant populations in the nation. The pull of constituent needs clearly put Bill Nelson into a position to push
for further cost cutting in Medicare prescription drug pricing. His target: closing the "donut hole" completely.
Nelson claimed that his amendment would onerate $106 billion in revenue, or from PhRMA's perspective increase their
cost-cutting to $186 billion. That would be unacceptable to PhRMA, to Baucus, to the White House and to the
pharmaceutical industry who had made the deal. Other Senate Democrats, Tom Carper and Robert Menendez voted with
Republicans and Baucus on the committee to defeat the amendment. It is little surprise the Carper's Delaware is home to

AstraZeneca and Menendez' New Jersey is home to Merck and Bristol-Myers-Squibb, all of which lobbied for the $80
billion cap.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid introduced the final bill, with the cap in place, on November 19. Debate began on Dec.
3, and with it come one more attempt by members to change the terms of the deal. Senator Byron Dorgan introduced an
amendment that would allow for drug re-importation, but as the date for voting drew near, the Federal Drug Administration
(FDA) released a letter objecting to the proposal that echoed pharmaceutical industry talking points: "...as currently
written, the resulting structure would be logistically challenging to implement and resource intensive. In addition, there are
significant safety concerns." Dorgan's amendment was defeated with numerous Democrats previously in support of
reimportation switching to "no" votes.
On Christmas Eve, the bill passed the Senate with the PhRMA deal fully intact.
***
New Year's Eve passed with no further action on health care reform. Public opinion regarding the health care reform bill
had been slipping throughout 2009. It reached a fulcrum in the special election to replace the deceased senator Ted
Kennedy in Massachusetts on January 19, 2010. Newly minted senator Scott Brown campaigned that he would be the
senator to provide Republicans with the votes to filibuster the final health care reform bill. Democrats ran for cover.
Despite having the largest majorities of any party since the 1970s, Democrats put the brakes on their agenda, particularly
health care reform.
in the end, the pharmaceutical industry's support for health care reform would be left up in the air. After spending $100
million in advertising in support of legislation that Tauzin and key executives hoped would be a windfall for the
pharmaceutical industry, the legislative process had flat-lined. In February, the board of PhRMA, split over the deal cut by
Tauzin, pushedjauzin to_res
..i
.s., his .post.
In an interview with Diane Sawvqf., President Obama owed up to failures in the process of passing health care reform,
"[The health care debate as it unfolded legitimately raised concerns not just among my opponents, but also amongst
supporters that we just don't know what's going on ... And it's an ugly process and it looks like there are a bunch of back
room deals."

former campaign manager and chief of staff to the powerful Senate Finance
Committee chairman Max Baucus. Both were known for their unparalleled
legislative abilities.
Because of Obama's decision to develop a plan operating through the legislative
process, members of Congress also played key roles. Early on, the pharmaceutical
companies were told to deal directly with Senate Finance Committee chairman Max
Baucus <http.

House and PhRMA.
Central to this effort was PhRMA president, CEO and top lobbyist Billy Tauzin, a
longtime Democratic member of Congress who switched party affiliations after
Republicans gained control of Congress in 1994. By switching parties Tauzin was
able to maintain his influence and even rose to be Chairman of the House
Committee on Energy & Commerce. Tauzin became the poster child of Washington's
mercenary culture. He crafted a bill to provide prescription drug access to
Medicare recipients, one that provided major concessions to the pharmaceutical
industry. Medicare would not be able to negotiate for lower prescription drug
costs and reimportation of drugs from first world countries would not be
allowed. A few months after the bill passed, Tauzin announced that he was
retiring- from Congress and would be taking a job helming PhRMA for a salary of
$2 million.
Tauzin's job change became fodder for a campaign ad that then presidential
candidate Barack Obama ran in the spring of 2008 simply titled "Billy
<htto:J/www.joutdbe. Tii,arcl
-,?v-NCRpOg9CfA> ." It featured the candidate,
sleeves rolled up, talking to a salon of gasping Americans about the ways of
Washington. "The pharmaceutical industry wrote into the prescription drug plan
that Medicare could not negotiate with drug
. companies. And you know what, the
chairman of the committee, who pushed the law through, went to work for the
pharmaceutical industry making $2 million a year." The screen fades to black to
Inform the viewer that, "Barack Obama is the only candidate who refuses
Washington lobbyist money," while the candidate continues his lecture, "Imagine
that. That's an example of the same old game playing in Washington. You know, I
don't want to learn how to play the game better, I want to put an end to the
game playing."
Aiding PhRMA in their outreach to Congress would be a squadron of lobbyists to
push their health care reform priorities. Over the course of 2009, the drug
industry trade group spent over $28 million
<1-7,2://,;

on in house and hired lobbyists. Aside from PhRMA's massive in-house lobbying

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767167 Date: 08/31/2015
operation, the trade group hired 48 outside lobbying firms. The total number of
lobbyists working for PhRMA in 2009 reached 165. Some 137 of those 165 lobbyists
representing PhRMA were former employees of either the legislative or executive
branches. Of these dozens were former congressional staffers including two
former chiefs of staff to Max Baucus.
According to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, drug makers
contributed huge sums to congressional campaign committees
<http://www.opensecrets.orgLindustries/indus.ohp?ind=H04>
during the same period--from January to the end of October (4th quarter numbers
are still being totaled), industry political action committees, employees and
their family members flooded lawmakers with over $8 million. Those contributions
tilted heavily to Democrats over Republicans by a 57 to 42 percent margin--the
first time in any election cycle going back to 1990, the first year that the
Center for Responsive Politics began tracking industry giving, that Democrats
were so favored. Given their majorities on Capitol Hill, and the new President's
intention to reform America's health care system, the new tilt was perhaps not
surprising.

On March 5, the White House held a meeting with major health care industry
leaders <http://www.pbs.org/newsouridodates/health/jan-june09/healthcare_03:105„html>
to try to bring them to the table and see what could be done to gain their
support. In attendance were Billy Tauzin, oresident, CEO and top lobbyist for
PhRMA, Pfizer CEO Jeff Kindler, America's Health Care Plans (AHIP) Chairman
Karen Ignani, Tom Donohue of the Chamber of Commerce and Robert Wood Johnson

by this apparent change of heart on behalf of an industry long adverse to health
care reforms.
On April 15, Jim Messina and Jon Selib, chief of staff to Senate Finance
Committee chairman Max Baucus, convened a meeting at the headquarters of the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) with leaders of organized labor
and health care groups, including PhRMA. At the meeting, the groups decided to
form two nonprofit entities to promote reform efforts, Healthy Economy Now and
Americans for Stable Quality Care, that would be almost entirely funded by PhRMA
<http://www.politico.com/news/storaes/l009/28362.html> . The two groups spent
$24 million on their advertising campaigns; the contract to produce and place
ads went to White House Senior Advisor David Axelrod's former firm
<hrt:t_p ://wy,T.p.b_LI .co.cominews/stories 809/26240 , AKPD, which owed
Axelrod $2 million.
In the next month, CEO's from pharmaceutical companies would meet with Baucus
and administration officials at least four times. These talks preceded a major
public event at the White House, one critical to its strategy to promote health
care reform. On May 11, PhRMA and other trade industry groups pledged cost
cutting measures
<i,ttb://cnnmoney„printth i_t:/.com/pt/cpt?action-cpt&tit Heaith-

to the White House that would save, they claimed, upwards of $2 trillion over
the next decade. President Obama announced the deal in the State Dining Room,
flanked by leaders of the various trade groups; the administration followed up
with a media blitz in the press and on the White House Web site
<http://www.whitehouse.govibloq/Coming-Togethe: rinQing-Down-Costs/> .
The next day, Healthy Economy Now's PhRMA funded ad campaign ran their first
advertisement <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KuoAV6vt0> in support of the
health care reform process calling for the government to finally "fix" the
nation's health care cost problems. While many elements of the $2 trillion cost
cutting pledge fell apart, the drug industry remained committed to the process
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767167 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767167 Date: 08/31/2015
in the hopes that they could ultimately win out and defeat the provisions they
most feared in closed-door meetings with the White House.
The first occurred on June 2. White House visitor logs show PhRMA's top
executives, including Tauzin, and industry CEOs met with Sarah Fenn from the
White House Office of Health Care Reform. On the same day, the publicly
available schedule of Senator Max Baucus shows Tauzin and the same industry CEOs
met the Senate Finance Committee chairman. What ultimately resulted from these
coordinated meetings would be revealed by Baucus on June 20.
In a press release <htt//fil,ance.-enate.ov/oress/3eress/2009press4;rb062009_,pdf>
featuring a statement by Tauzin, Baucus revealed that the pharmaceutical
industry had accepted $80 billion in cost cutting measures to be included in the
Senate Finance Committee version of the bill. According to news reports
<http://dyn.polit co.com/p.
:
rint tony.cfm?uuid-BDi8F267-18FE-70P2-A8P 9b 0?6D2,27DF>
, Baucus initially proposed $100 billion in cost cutting measures, but the
executives and lobbyists meeting on June 2 were able to win the lower figure.
The terms of the initial cost-cutting deal included $30 billion go directly
towards closing the "donut hole" in Medicare prescription drug coverage. The
"donut hole" is a term for the gap in coverage that occurs within the Medicare
prescription drug coverage. For those purchasing prescription drugs through the
Medicare program coverage cuts off at $2,700 spent and does not pick back up
again until $6,154 is spent by the participant. The amount proposed in the deal,
50 percent coverage for drugs within the coverage gap, however, would not
completely close the "donut hole."
In Baucus' press release, Tauzin is quoted as saying, "This is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and, working together, we can make this hope for
a better tomorrow a reality today." This "once-in-a-lifetime" opportunity also
extended to the pharmaceutical industry's ability to blunt the long-term
Democratic agenda of lowering prescription drug prices through Medicare
negotiations, re-importation and quicker release of generics onto the market.
After making such a grand statement of support through cost cutting proposals it
was time for the pharmaceutical industry to finally force the White House and
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767167 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767167 Date: 08/31/2015
Democrats to take certain chips off the table.
Baucus proceeded with a plan to convene a bipartisan group
<htt--//www nvtimes.com/2009/07/28/us/or
,litics/28baucus.html>
in an effort to craft the bill desired by the White House. These participants
included Democrats Kent Conrad and Jeff Bingaman and Republicans Chuck Grassley,
Mike Enzi and Olympia Snowe. Baucus' decision and the need to solidify deals
with groups like the pharmaceutical industry - which were reliant on Baucus
producing a bill - slowed down the legislative process making it impossible for
Congress to meet the White House's announced August recess deadline
<http://www.huffinotonpostzcom/2009L07/2/ bama-defends-auoust-dead n 241755.html>
for passing health care reform.
Soon after, PhRMA's big guns and industry lobbyists paid the White House another
visit on July 7 and this time met with Rahm Emanuel and Jim Messina (Baucus'
chief of staff Jon Selib is also listed in White House visitor logs for this
meeting). In August, The Huffington Post's
<http://www.huffingtonpostcom/2009/08/13/intelnaL-memo-confirms-bi n 258285.html>
Ryan Grim reported on an internal memo that was drafted at that meeting that
outlined the policies that would not be allowed into any final version of health
'care reform. These included Medicare prescription drug negotiations, drug
re-importation, and the lowering of prices for drugs available through Medicare
Part D and Part B. The deal would be $eo billion in cost cutting and absolutely
no more.
***
While the $80 billion deal was cut with Baucus' committee, other congressional
committees continued to mark-up their own versions of health care reform without
the knowledge that the White House was relying on Baucus to produce the final
product. In the House of Representatives, the House Energy & Commerce Committee
leveled a direct threat to the $80 billion deal. Energy & Commerce Chair Henry
Waxman sought to include all of the provisions that PhRMA had gotten the White
House and Baucus to cut out of the reform bill. These included drug
reimportation, Medicare negotiating power and speedier release of generics to
the market. According to previous analysis of the measures proposed by the
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767167 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767167 Date: 08/31/2015
committee, these measures would have totaled hundreds of billions in cost cuts,
far exceeding the $80 billion cap agreed to by the White House, Baucus and
PhRMA.
The cost cutting measures passed in the Energy & Commerce bill spooked the board
of PhRMA, which included all of the CEOs involved in the deal-cutting meetings
with the White House and Baucus. The board pressured Tauzin to go public with
the deal to ensure that the White House would recognize it and not renege. On
August 4, the Los Angeles Times <ht:to.:
hea.Lthr'arg=-oh--m-4>
:es.iatlmes.coa
-1/2009,iaug/04/ iaL.Ion/na:
, in an exclusive report, featured quotes from Tauzin claiming that a deal
between the White House and PhRMA. existed and that as Tauzin put it, "The White
House blessed it." Tom Hamburger wrote in the article, "For his part, Tauzin
said he had not only received the White House pledge to forswear Medicare drug
price bargaining, but also a separate promise not to pursue another proposal
Obama supported during the campaign: importing cheaper drugs from Canada or
Europe."
The White House's Jim Messina later confirmed Tauzin's claim, stating, "The
president encouraged this approach ... He wanted to bring all the parties to the
table to discuss health insurance reform."
Democratic lawmakers were furious. Rep. Raul Grijalva, chairman of the
Progressive Caucus, asked <Ottp://www_lytimes 09/08/06/ heal icy/06insure.
, "Are industry groups going to be the ones at the table who get the first big
piece of the pie and we just fight over the crust?"
***
On September 7, Baucus' bill made a private circulation on the Hill;
pharmaceutical industry cost-cutting did not exceed $80 billion. Five days
later, the New York Times <h ://_prescriptJ_(- s.bloq.utimes.com/20 'drug-makers-
o
plan-to-back-baucus-plan-with-ad-dollars/?
reported that PhRMA planned to spend up to $150 million in an advertising blitz
in support of Baucus' bill. The Times noted that the ad spending "...would be a
follow-up to the deal that drug makers struck in June with Mr. Baucus and the
White House." On September 16, Baucus released the full text of his legislation

<htto://www.huffingtonp2st.com/2009/09/16/health-care-bill-baucus7s .n_288218,hitml>
to the public.
The White House, PhRMA and Baucus still had to fight a few battles to keep the
deal intact. The key amendment targeting the PhRMA deal in committee mark-up
came from Sen. Bill Nelson from Florida, which has one of the largest Medicare
participant populations in the nation. The pull of constituent needs clearly put
Bill Nelson into a position to push for further cost cutting in Medicare
prescription drug pricing. His target: closing the "donut hole" completely.
Nelson claimed that his amendment would generate $106 billion in revenue
<4ttp://www,politioo.comilivepuise/0909Ne:Lson PhRMA amendment_ , or
from PhRMA's perspective increase their cost-cutting to $186 billion. That would
be unacceptable to PhRMA, to Baucus, to the White House and to the
pharmaceutical industry who had made the deal. Other Senate Democrats, Tom
Carper and Robert Menendez voted with Republicans and Baucus on the committee to
defeat the amendment <htto://ww4.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/sep/24/panel-faH.s=
overturn-white-house-deal-drugmakers/>
. It is little surprise the Carper's Delaware is home to AstraZeneca and
•
Menendez' New Jersey is home to Merck and Bristol-Myers-Squibb, all of which
lobbied for the $80 billion cap.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid introduced the final bill, with the cap in
place, on November 19. Debate began on Dec. 3, and with it come one more attempt
by members to change the terms of the deal. Senator Byron Dorgan introduced an
amendment that would allow for drug re-importation, but as the date for voting
drew near, the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) released a letter
<hti-p://thehiil.com/home-ews/senate/r1307-ida-opRoses-senate-drug-importation-amendmen>
objecting to the proposal that echoed pharmaceutical industry talking points:
...as currently written, the resulting structure would be logistically
challenging to implement and resource intensive. In addition, there are
significant safety concerns." Dorgan's amendment was defeated
<http://www.2plitico.com/iivepuise/1209/BREAKING Senate rejects Dorgan amendment.html>
with numerous Democrats previously in support of reimportation switching to "no"
votes.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767167 Date: 08/31/2015
On Christmas Eve, the bill passed the Senate with the PhRMA deal fully intact.
* * *
New Year's Eve passed with no further action on health care reform. Public
opinion regarding the health care reform bill had been slipping throughout 2009.
It reached a fulcrum in the special election to replace the deceased. senator Ted
Kennedy in Massachusetts on January 19, 2010. Newly minted senator Scott Brown
campaigned that he would be the senator to provide Republicans with the votes to
filibuster the final health care reform bill. Democrats ran for cover. Despite
having the largest majorities of any party since the 1970s, Democrats put the
brakes on their agenda, particularly health care reform.
In the end, the pharmaceutical industry's support for health care reform would
be left up in the air . After spending $100 million in advertising in support of
legislation that Tauzin and key executives hoped would be a windfall for the
pharmaceutical industry, the legislative process had flat-lined. In February,
the board of PhRMA, split over the deal cut by Tauzin, pushed Tauzin to resign

I recently had the opportunity to participate in a small dinner with CENTCOM Commander .
General David Petraeus and his wife Holly. These sorts of discussions are nearly always off the record -- but the fact that
they happened is not off limits.
Petraeus was not in uniform but rather wore what looked to me to be a brand new, perfectly tailored dark suit. I joked to
him that if I Twilt.-
-s
,rgc, that out of two dozen or so times I had seen Petraeus that this was the first time I'd seen him out of
uniform, an ice cold shudder of fear would spread quickly through some political circles in DC.
In August of 2007, I wroteoiece, stating that folks should keep an eye out for the possibility that General Petraeus might
run for President in 2012. In April 2008, Steven Lee Myers wrote a solid New York Times follow up titled "The
General" referencing my earlier take.
Recently, legendary newsman Ai:nai4d de 13orchgave resuscitated the topic of an Eisenhoweresque future for the
counterinsurgency guru in his piece, "President ?etraeus7"
Petraeus was recently named as one of Foreign Policy magazine's tip 100 ttzal thinkers, and as U.S. News & World
Reports "Washington Whispers" notes, he is going to be speaking in May 2010 at the annual American Enterprise
Institute dinner receiving the Irving Kristol Award.
In January 2010, Public Policy Pollin.q revealed that while Obama held a ten point lead over a potential wild card race
against Petraeus, the General had some strengths. But the pollsters also noted that many in the American public just
didn't know enough yet about Petraeus to form an opinion:
Finally our blog readers voted for David Petraeus as our wild card Republican this month and his
numbers come out as a mixed bag. He has the largest deficit against Obama, trailing 44-34. But at +13
his net favorability is better than the President or any of the other Republicans we tested. The problem for
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767171 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767171 Date: 08/31/2015
him is that the numbers break down 25/12- 63% of voters in the country don't know enough about him to
have formed an opinion. Who knows if Petraeus would actually have any interest in going into politics, but
if he did he would be introducing himself to many voters for the first time.
President Obama himself, according to what some of his aides have reported to me, is quite taken with David Petraeus
and respects his approach and thinking.
Petraeus has also been respectful of the President -- although when pushed at a recent forum about how he might react
to a Presidential decision on Afghanistan that the General might not have liked, Petraeus offered a cryptic rather than
clear response. (see above video)
At the "First Draft of History" meeting sponsored by the Atlantic Monthly/Atlantic Media Group, the Newseum, and the
Aspen Institute; Petraeus when asked if he would support the President no matter what the result of the strategic review
on Afghanistan responded that he "would continue to give the President the best professional military advice he could."
Contrast that with Defense Secretary Robert Gates resoonOinato_the..saest.ipr
.j., "We will salute and execute [the
President's] decisions faithfully and to the best of our ability."
But after spending an evening with General Petraeus and watching him closely for a number of years, there is no way that
this intelligent leader -- with whom I have some disagreements but respect -- could be comfortable with the Tea Party
takeover of the Republican political machine.
There is always the possibility that a core of reasonable Republicans like Michael Bloomberg, James Baker, Olympia
Snowe, Chuck Hegel, Alan Simpson, John Whitehead, Peter Peterson, Rita Hauser and others will try to rekindle classic
Republican sensibilities by fighting to re-hijack their party back in an Eisenhower-like campaign with Petraeus at the lead.
Remember that Eisenhower clinched the Republican nomination by promising to be the President who though he knew
war would end the Korean War. Petraeus knows Afghanistan and Iraq -- and though it seems hard to envision today could
be the kind of leader promising to end those wars if Obama proves unable to do so.
But there is another option that intrigues me and seems more realistic than imagining the iconic David Petraeus running
for President -- and that is his running for Vice President.
I think Vice President Joe Biden has done an outstanding job and of all the big guns in the Obama White House, Biden
has done the best job of outperforming expectations. He had given President Obama much needed counsel, not always
taken regrettably, but counsel that Obama needed to show the American public he was getting. Biden has been the key
agent behind the scenes in moving Iraq's elections forward. He has scored a lot of wins -- not reported -- in the
nuclear/WMD controls arena. Biden has worked with Gates in stabilizing an awkward and complex relationship with
Russia -- and his counterpoints on the Afghanistan surge, in my view, remain compelling.
But Biden is going to have to find a way to hold his spot in 2012 because others are going to be gunning for it.
As I look at it now, Hillary Clinton who has now said that she will not do more than one term as Secretary of State would
be a natural candidate for the Obama VP slot. Her franchise is not completely in the control of the Obama team yet, but
moving Hillary closer to the White House (although her private home on Whitehaven Street is actually a couple of hundred
feet closer to the White House than the VP residence at the Naval Observatory) would finalize Obarna's takeover of all the
key political franchises in the Democratic Party -- starting with Daley's machine, Deschle's machine, Kennedy's machine,
Edwards' machine, and then the Clintons'.
But General David Petraeus, in his business suit, lurks out there. Obama seems to be concerned about looking like he is
weak on national security. The Republicans -- at Cheney's constant goading (and now Sarah Palin's) -- seem to want to
continue to play politics through fear-mongering.
Obama could neutralize the possibility that he faces a Republican party challenge by David Petraeus by inviting the
General on to the 2012 ticket as a Democrat.
Crazy? Perhaps.
But inviting potential rivals into his tent is becoming a standard Obama trademark -- much as he did by appointing
Republican Governor of Utah and former G.W. Bush administration Deputy US Trade Representative Jon Huntsman, Jr.
to serve as US Ambassador to the People's Republic of China.
And get this, we have just learned that David Petraeus has not voted since 2002 -- not because he doesn't care to vote --
but reportedly because he wants to keep his eventual political options and political loyalties open.
This is a soldier for whom all options are on the table and who is keeping his powder dry.
My hunch is that whether Obama sticks with Vice President Biden or pivots to someone else, Petraeus will be on the short
list of those considered.

H: FYI. The end of Justice Jim. Sid
Supreme Court Justice Jim Johnson, known both for his segregationist political activities in the 1950s and dabbling in
the political campaign against Bill Clinton during his presidency, died yesterday.
A Faulkner County sheriffs office spokesman, Lt. Matt Rice, said Johnson was found dead in his home about 10 a.m.
Saturday with an apparently self-inflicted chest wound from a .30-30 rifle. Johnson had been beset by medical
problems, he said. Roller-McNutt Funeral Home in Conway will be handling arrangements.
He was 85. Here's a standat biographica: hstory. This will end his prolific and pointed letters to the editor (unless some
are still in the pipeline), delivered on stationery marked with his name for his Conway home, "White Haven."
Justice Jim was a courtly man and lively company, gracious in social interaction with friend and political foe. But Mark
Anthony's words in Julius Caesar about men's deeds come, unavoidably, to mind. As recently as 1990, he worked in an
effort to preserve state Amendment 44, the states rights amendment aimed at curbing integration that was his brainchild.
It had long been declared unconstitutional by federal courts and was barely repealed by voters.

Re: H: FYI. The end of Justice Jim. Sid
I thought your designation of Iran as a near military government was very good. Gary Sick has been arguing that it is in
fact a military government. Of course this is predicate for targeted sanctions. There is a consistent thread in the
challenges we face from a host of authoritarian (and totalitarian) military governments, sometimes loosely allied on an ad
hoc basis--Iran, China, Myanmar, Venezuela, Cuba. This is nothing like the Cold War, but it's an idea worth exploring, not
publicly discussing, but thinking about.
On Justice Jim, a couple of thoughts: I wish his tragic end were as politically conclusive as that of Edmund Ruffin, the
Southern fire-eater and secessionist who was given the honor of firing the first shot at Fort Sumter and upon hearing of
Appomattox carefully sat himself down in his grand Charleston house and blew his brains out with a shotgun.
Unfortunately, the evil Justice Jim did lives on--in the wild bigotry against Obama and even through the Supreme Court
decision in the case of Citizens United, a group he helped galvanize to circulate the Whitewater hoax.

Podesta: W.H. 'lost' health
narrative
By: AH!,
February 15, 2010 03:03 PM
EST
John Podesta, the president of the
Center for American Progress who
led Barack Obama's presidential
transition, acknowledges the White
House has been unable to
successfully drive the debate on
health care reform.
"They lost the narrative," Podesta
told the Financial Times. "They lost
the perspective of how all of the
activity they were engaged in was
knit together."
In a video interview posted on the
newspaper's website Monday,
Podesta also bemoaned the
present political climate in
Washington and expressed
frustration with inability of the White
House and Congress to advance
the president's agenda.
"Change is hard in America. We've
all learned that over the last year,"
said the former White House chief
of staff under Bill Clinton. "There is
real frustration amongst
independent voters, and anger
amongst independent voters."
Voters have become discouraged,
Podesta said, by seeing "no spirit in
which people were having a

reasonable conversation" during the
health care debate and from "the
last twist and turns on health care,
the special deals that had to be
made in the Senate to get the 60
votes."
Asked how he would rate the health
of the American political system, he
responded simply: "Sucks."
"It feels like a very frustrated
country, a country frustrated with
the inability of Washington to do
anything to get the economy going
again, to get jobs going again," he
said. "And I think that there is
tremendous anger [and] frustration
about the inability to improve
people's lives."
Republicans also have shown little
ability to raise the level of debate,
Podesta suggested.
Obama's "not dealing with the party
of Lincoln. He's dealing with the
party of Palin," Podesta said,
referring to Sarah Palin, the former
Alaska governor who was the 2008
GOP vice presidential nominee.

H: FYI: Les Gelb. S
Replace Rahm
by Leslie H. Gelb
February 15, 2010 I 10:48pm
I ....7IKristoffer Tripplaar / SPA President Obama desperately needs a sweeping staff shakeup to
save his presidency. Leslie H. Gelb on why he must reassign Rahm, dump Larry Summers, and get rid
of National Security adviser Jim Jones.
The negative, even dismissive, talk about the Obama White House has reached a critical point. The president must
change key personnel now. Unless he speedily sets up a new team, he will be reduced to a speechmaker. It's mostly a
matter of relocating the Chicago and campaign crowd who surround the Oval Office and inserting people with proven
records of getting things done in Washington and the world.
To be fair, it's not clear whether the bad judgments on priorities, practicalities, and steadiness come from Mr. Obama or
his White House team. Maybe he overpowers them in discussions, or maybe he gives them a role in policymaking far
beyond their experience in that realm. Unless you're there, you don't know. But Mr. Obama is the president, and except
for the right-wing crazies, most Americans still recognize his great talents and promise. It is he who's got to be helped. So
it is they who've got to go.
It is he who's got to be helped. So it is they who've got to go.
One may quarrel with my sense of urgency here. But it's hard to have a conversation with opinion leaders anywhere—and
especially in Washington—that doesn't descend into ripping Obama's White House team. The refrain of complaints is
always the same:
• Obama is forever taking strong stances only to backfill and trim. Most recently, he said he did not "begrudge" Wall
Streeters their big earnings because that was part of the market system. This, in the face of his saying only a couple of
weeks ago that such big bonuses were "shameful."
• Obama doesn't know what's really going on. Regarding the Middle East, he recently said that "I think it is absolutely true
that what we did this year didn't produce the kind of breakthrough that we wanted, and if we had anticipated some of
these political problems on both sides earlier, we might not have raised expectations as high." He had to be totally out of it
not to realize that the Palestinians and Israelis were nowhere close to sitting down with each other and dealing.
• Obama wants to get along with everyone so badly he doesn't recognize real opposition when he sees it—let alone know
how to deal with it. He emerges from a meeting with congressional Republican leaders on health-care reform and says he
is "an eternal optimist—when those very same Republican leaders just told the press that they don't see any common
ground and believe the administration has to "scrap the bill and start over."
• It's even hard to follow his latest Afghan policy. He calls Afghanistan a "war of necessity" and orders more than 30,000
new troops there, coupled with an announcement that he'll begin withdrawing some of them in a year plus, only to see
some of his advisers say he will start withdrawals and some say he won't.
I've scribbled similar points in recent months in The Daily Beast. And last week in The Financial Times, Edward Luce
provided a thunderclap on Washington's negative consensus about the incompetence of Obarna's Chicago-laden team.
Luce named names in the White House, and a number of journalists and bloggers strikingly failed to link to the Luce story.
They were said to fear the wrath of the Chicagoans. Steve Clemons, author of The Washington Note, essentially
eridorse.d the Luce finding and slapped his fellow bloggers' wrists for hiding from this issue. The situation is as serious as
it was during the Carter administration. There, two very capable political campaigners--Hamilton Jordan and Jody
Powell—moved into critical White House positions without knowing very much about doing business in Washington. And
they were, quite naturally, too busy to learn. They also added to the "them" versus "us" (Washington insiders and
bureaucrats versus the regular guys from Georgia) mentality that plagues most administrations.
The Chicagoans and others "guarding" the president create their own "us versus them" world. It's hard to imagine a policy
conversation between the president and the Chicago crowd, since none of them, except Rahm Emanuel, has Washington
or policy experience. And there isn't much evidence that they bring in strong-minded outsiders to challenge the president
on a regular basis either. The result is an inexperienced president advised by an inexperienced team.
Here are the personnel changes being bruited about in political and policy circles: First, remove Rahm Emanuel as chief
of staff and move him to a senior political adviser slot. No one I've talked to believes he has the management skills and
discipline to run the White House. But he is a terrific political mind and a fighter and should be given the new job and the

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767202 Date: 08/31/2015
time to do his thing. Proven pros who could step right in include the following: Erskine Bowles, president of the University
of North Carolina and former Clinton chief of staff; Leon Panetta, now CIA director and formerly White House chief as well
under Clinton; Sylvia Mathews, a former deputy chief of staff also under Clinton; and John Podesta, another former
Clinton chief who now heads the Center for American Progress. All four are tough and know how to manage.
Replace Lawrence Summers, director of the White House's National Economic Council, with Paul Volcker, the former
chairman of the Federal Reserve. Summers is brilliant and highly controversial; he's been beaten up and is said to want
out anyway. Volcker has unmatched stature, practical experience, and the courage of a lion. He is the only one now in a
position to get down to step-by-step brass tacks on the economy and stop Mr. Obama's weekly gyrations. Others with
proven track records who can help as inside or outside advisers are: Stephen Robert, formerly head of Oppenheimer,
Vincent Mai, former leader of AEA Investors, and Tom Hill of Blackstone. There are also two economic stars in
Washington who'd improve both policymaking and public combat: Sheila Bair, chairwoman of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, and Elizabeth Warren, chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel. One outside adviser above all
would help the president see the economic hard choices ahead: Peter G. Peterson, accomplished businessman and
policy head.
David Axelrod, the senior political adviser to the president, needs to concentrate on the next presidential campaign,
wherein his expertise lies, and not on domestic and foreign policy, where he is just another smart unknowledgeable voice.
Good replacements who do know the politics of Washington would be the aforementioned Podesta; and Tom Deschle, the
former Democratic Senate Majority Leader. As for David Plouffe, another senior campaign aide, now in unofficial
residence at the White House, he should be lodged in the nearby Executive Office Building. Senior adviser and Chicago
buddy Valerie Jarrett is too much a part of the inner circle to move, but she should be given a more limited role in making
policy.
Mr. Obama's crowd appears to think that getting things done means his giving another speech. It's nice, but not nearly
enough.
Robert Gibbs needs a rest from being press secretary. Let's put it this way: He wasn't born for daily jousts with pithy
Republicans. His job calls for memorable and pointed phrases and attacks, not circle-the-wagon circumlocutions. Possible
successors? Try Doyle McManus of the L.A. Times, Jake Tapper of ABC News, or Helene Cooper of The New York
Times.
Last but not least, James Jones, the National Security Adviser, has to move on. The career Marine was greatly admired
and respected as Commandant of the Corps and as NATO's military chief. He handled those duties with great skill. But by
wide acclamation inside and outside the White House, he has not emerged as a strategist—perhaps the key requirement
of this key position. The person in that job has to pull everything together—laying out achievable objectives and precise
plans to dispense carefully packaged carrots and sticks. One Democrat who could step in now, despite his age, is
Zbigniew Brzezinski, Jimmy Carter's national-security adviser. He has a first-rate strategic mind—a rare quality—and
knows how to deliver results. Obama will need to iron out Zbig's lack of sympathy toward Israel and Russia.
Also available are a boatload of first-class retired diplomats with the judgment and background needed to perform the
National Security Council job effectively. They would be greeted with applause both at home and abroad. Try former
ambassadors Thomas Pickering, Morton Abramowitz, Frank Wisner, Reginald Bartholomew, and Winston Lord. They
have it all. At a minimum, they and others like them should form the core of a group that meets regularly with Obama on
strategy.
Yes, many of the pros suggested above have reached their golden years. But 70 and even 80 are the new 60. They all
possess the necessary energy, experience and rare skill in delivering results. They are also shovel-ready. As a critical
bonus, they could and would mentor the next generation down, a very talented one indeed, to succeed them in two or
three years. To lead America and the world, Obama has to grow far beyond his present propensity to treat problems as
intellectual puzzles—to collect facts and hear the arguments. The great tasks of governing demand proven intuition in
sensing what's achievable, which buttons to push when, how to buy the time for power to take hold, how to make
adjustments without flagrantly foolish rhetoric, how to avoid failures that only diminish power, and how to succeed in small
as well as large ways. With a team versed in such arts and skills, President Obama and America would succeed.

Re: Iran, Saudi
Had dinner last night (Tuesday, February 16) with Joschka Fischer. We had an interesting conversation on Iran
and Saudi Arabia, among other things. (As you know Fischer is now director of the Nabucco pipeline project.)
On Iran, harsh, targeted sanctions are absolutely necessary, but are most effective diplomatically when always
coupled with an offer to negotiate. The iron fist in the velvet glove approach achieves several objectives:
According to Fischer's intelligence, Ahmanijehad wished some negotiated settlement but was blocked. The
regime has splits at the top. Perhaps true, perhaps not. But constantly pushing negotiations alongside sanctions
puts additional pressure on internal divisions, whatever they are. Extending an open hand while brandishing a
stick closes diplomatic and political room to maneuver for Iran: Its refusal to accept the open hand justifies
application of the stick. Even when sanctions are enforced it always remains useful to say another way is open.
The damage done to Iran is therefore the result of its own choice. This approach also aids the opposition. A
purely condign sanctions strategy can contribute to the regime's will to punish and tighten repression. Talking
of regime change, of course, undermines the cause of regime change. It is a gift to the regime. The opposition is
a new factor in the Iran equation that must be taken into account on the political and moral level. Pushed to the
wall, the regime may feel compelled to repress, which might involve thousands or tens of thousands of political
killings. On Saudi Arabia, Fischer points out that if Iran develops nuclear weaponry the Saudis already have
their own bomb. The Saudis invested in Pakistan's nuclear weaponry partly for this eventuality; that's their

ambling Over Rahm
by Leslie H. Gelb
February 22, 2010 I 3:26pm
-
L - Alex Brandon / AP Photo Leslie H. Gelb's call for White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel to
be reassigned spurred a circle-the-wagons reaction from pro- (or perhaps even anti-) Rahm forces.
Gelb sifts the fallout for clues.
When you write that the president of the United States should replace his chief of staff, someone will fire back. So it was
that Rahm Emanuel apparently struck back at my piece last week on the Daily Beast through a column in Sunday's
Washington Post. Only this time, the return fire had a rare twist, one that could produce Washington convulsions. It was
seemingly aimed at me (and others who published suggestions of Emanuel's limitations as chief). But whether it was
intentional or not, the volley actually struck the president himself.
Here is the story, a very Washington tale of stretching permissible criticism of power holders, of pungent media leaks, of
labyrinthine speculation as to who is doing what to whom.
Maybe the leaker thought the way to get rid of Rahm completely was to brand him as a "traitor" to the boss.
With a headline "Replace Rahm," I wrote last Tuesday that Emanuel lacked the managerial skills, discipline, and strategic
ability to get things done as chief of staff. I argued he should be moved over to a political adviser slot, where his
considerable, can-do talents would better serve his boss. I targeted others as well, mostly in Mr. Obama's Chicago crowd.
Several writers also blasted this crowd, mostly with unsigned bullets, but never crossed the red line calling for their
removal. I wrote the piece because it essentially reflected the waves of anti-White House staff critiques breaking over
Washington, but rarely heard outside its drawing rooms. I did it because I believed the president was running out of
chances to succeed and needed better and tougher staffers. I did it because if he failed, the nation failed.
Then came the inevitable blast back, a devastating leak, in a piece by Dana Milbank, a respected Washington journalist.
Interesting that the leaker selected Milbank. He's sort of a half-reporter, half-columnist who roams the entire capital city,
not just the White House. The leaker must have felt safe because Milbank has so many sources all over town, making the
leakers harder to trace.
The Milbank headline read: "Why Obama needs Rahm at the top." It began: "Let us now praise Rahm Emanuel. No,
seriously." Then, he lists me and a couple others who also criticized Rahm. "But," he continued, "sacking Emanuel is the
last thing the president should do."
Then, Milbank (and presumably the leaker) delivered the surprise and wounding blow – to the president himself. "Obama's
first year fell apart in large part because he didn't follow his chief of staffs advice on crucial matters. Arguably, Emanuel is
the only person keeping Obama from becoming Jimmy Carter."
Then, Milbank (and the leaker) took his first shot, not at me, but at congressional liberals and everyone in the Chicago
crowd except Rahm. "Obama's problem," Milbank continued, "is that his other confidants—particularly Valerie Jarrett and
Robert Gibbs, and, to a lesser extent, David Axelrod—are part of the Cult of Obama. In love with the president, they
believe he is a transformational figure who needn't dirty his hands in politics."
So, it was "their" fault—until you see the real blow landed beyond them and on the President himself. "The president
would have been better off heeding Emanuel's counsel," but instead "overruled" him on several key Rahm
recommendations: not rushing to close Guantanamo and bringing terrorists to U.S. prisons, not trying Khalid Sheikh
Mohammed in New York, and going for a smaller health care bill focused on popular items with Republican support. "The
result was," Milbank wrote, "as the world now knows, disastrous." In other words, Mr. Obama could have thrived and
saved himself on key issues had he only listened to Rahm.
It sure looks like Rahm (or someone near and dear to him) trying to save himself at the president's expense. This is an
incredibly unusual leak, seemingly a chief of staff undermining his own boss, the president. Worse, it details specific
advice Rahm personally gave Mr. Obama in the absolute privacy of the Oval Office. Presidents go crazy at such breaches
of confidence.
Which is why another possibility has to be considered: that Rahm was not the leaker. The leak was so egregious, so anti-
Chicago crowd minus Rahm, so devastating to the president, that Emanuel couldn't have been stupid enough to leak a
story where he was the sole, surviving hero. Remember, too, that my piece did not recommend kicking Rahm out of the
White House, just sliding him over into a political adviser job where he could practice small-bite pragmatism. Maybe

someone didn't want Rahm around the White House at all, in any position. Maybe the leaker thought the way to get rid of
Rahm completely was to brand him as a "traitor" to the boss. Maybe the leaker belonged to that contingent of self-
mutilating liberal Democrats who have always viewed Rahm as too centrist and pragmatic.
Of course, I don't know what's afoot. And of course, Milbank put his own views into his own article. But someone gave him
the specifics, the precious ammunition about Rahm's private advice to Mr. Obama. The story is not over.

Car bomb explodes in Northern Ireland
Republican dissidents suspected after blast outside courthouse in Newry as evacuation was taking place
• Buzz up!

• quardian.co.uk, Tuesday 23 February 2010
• Article history
A car bomb exploded last night outside the courthouse in Newry, Northern Ireland, police said. There were no initial
reports of any injuries in the blast.
Police said the vehicle was abandoned at the front of the building in the Co Down town at around lOpm. Officers were in
the process of evacuating the area when the car exploded.
Suspicion is bound to fall on republican dissidents opposed to the peace process. The incident comes only days after a
mortar bomb failed to detonate outside a police station in the nearby Co Armagh village of Keady.
The chairman of the nationalist SDLP in Newry, Gary McKeown, condemned those responsible. "Lives could have been
lost as a result of this bombing," he said. "It serves absolutely no purpose and does nothing for the community, or the
cause of a united Ireland. If people want to advance their beliefs, they should enter the democratic process and debate
with their political opponents, rather than resorting to violence. Planting bombs outside courthouses will achieve nothing."
Earlier this month, police on both sides of the Irish border launched separate operations against dissident republicans.
Police in Northern Ireland arrested two men and a woman in connection with the murder of Constable Stephen Carroll, the
first PSNI officer killed by terrorists in the province.
The Continuity IRA shot the 48-year-old policeman dead on a housing estate in Craigavon, County Armagh, on 9 March
last year. His murder came just 48 hours after the Real IRA killed two British soldiers outside the Massereene barracks in
Antrim. In September police discovered a massive 600lb bomb in the south Armagh village of Forkhill.
On Sunday, Republican Sinn Fein, political allies of the Continuity IRA, claimed masked undercover soldiers carried out
surveillance on two housing estates in Lurgan, Co Armagh, in recent weeks. They claimed the men were scouting the
areas in white civilian vans. Republican Sinn Fein said the soldiers belonged to the Special Reconnaissance Regiment.
The alleged presence of SRR soldiers — formerly known as the 14th Intelligence Unit — is controversial because British
troops are meant to have been pulled off the streets, especially in nationalist areas.
Britain heading for hung parliament
Guardian/ICM poll
Tories might not win election outright, suggests new survey

The Conservatives should no longer count on winning the election outright, according to a Guardian/ICM poll published
today.
The new survey suggests Britain is on course for a hung parliament amid faltering public support for David Cameron's
party.
The opposition have also lost ground on key policy issues, including the economy, and in particular may be losing their
campaign against Labour's so-called "death tax". Labour leads the Tories by eight points as the party with the best policy
on care for the elderly.
The two parties are neck and neck on their ability to sort out the economic crisis, against a nine-point Tory lead when the
question was last asked in August 2009.
With no more than three months to go until polling day, the Conservatives have fallen to 37%, down three on last month's
Guardian/ICM poll and down two on another ICM poll earlier this month.
The party has not fallen so low in an ICM poll since the tail end of the banking crisis, last falling to 37% in February 2008.
As recently as last October the Tories hit 45% in an ICM poll and the party will be alarmed by this latest evidence that the
race is tightening, which confirms the findings of some other recent polls.
Meanwhile Labour's support, at 30%, is eight points up on its absolute ICM bottom last May, and slightly above its
average for the second part of last year. However, there is no sign of either a boost for the party following Gordon Brown's
Piers Morgan interview or a fall after this weekend's reports about Brown bullying his staff.
Labour's support is up one point on the last Guardian/ICM poll and unchanged from the most recent ICM poll. Research
began last Friday and most was carried out before the serialisation of Andrew Rawnsley's book in yesterday's Observer,
which may have affected Labour support. Around a fifth of responses were collected on Sunday.
Nick Clegg's hopes of a powerful place in a hung parliament are also boosted by today's poll, which puts the Liberal
Democrats on 20%, unchanged from the most recent ICM and down one on last month's Guardian poll.
All this suggests that Labour and the Lib Dems are holding steady while the Conservatives lose some ground to smaller
parties, which are on a total of 13%. Nationalists are on 5%, Ukip and the Greens on 3% each and the BNP on 2%.
Estimates of what these shares would mean for the parties on polling day vary, but a 7% lead is at the margins of what
the Tories think they need to win a majority. One academic calculation suggests the result would leave Labour only 25
seats behind the Tories in a hung parliament, although any improved Tory performance in marginal seats would offset
that.

Northern Ireland agrees power-sharing deal
Gordon Brown hails historic deal which will see justice and policing powers be devolved to Stormont from 12 April

Justice and policing powers will be devolved to Northern Ireland's power-sharing government from 12 April in a historic
deal agreed by the main parties that "opens a new chapter" after decades of violence, Gordon Brown said today.
Standing alongside his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, at a press conference at Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast, the
prime minister said the "inspirational" agreement between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) was a
foundation for lasting peace.
The deal — finally agreed to by the DUP last night and described as a final piece in the jigsaw after a long search for
peace — comes after two weeks of round-the-clock negotiations and brings an end to fears that the power-sharing
government might collapse.
It will see policing and justice powers devolved from Westminster to the assembly within weeks and includes new plans
on overseeing parades.
Brown, who travelled to Belfast this morning, said the agreement had been possible because of "a new spirit of mutual co-
operation and respect".
The deal meets a key Sinn Fein demand and prevents the republican party from walking out of the power-sharing
executive. In return, the DUP has secured reforms to the way loyalist marches are handled in Northern Ireland, including
the abolition of the Parades Commission, a body most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists.
A cross-community vote will now be held in the Stormont assembly on 9 March before the policing and justice powers are
devolved from London on 12 April.
Brown told reporters: "The achievements have been as great as they are inspirational. This moment and this agreement
belongs to the people of Northern Ireland, all of the people, and now more than ever before so does their future ... This is
the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years of talks,
weeks of stalemate."
Cowen praised both unionists and nationalists for making "fair and balanced compromises" to bridge the divisions and
said the quality of the negotiations meant that the "devolved institutions can and will work".
The Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, said the deal would further isolate republican dissidents who have
launched three separate gun and bomb attacks against police stations in the province over the last 10 days. The deal
would "absolutely" make Northern Ireland a safer place, he said.
The DUP leader, Peter Robinson, said the agreement "will be more enduring because of the time spent" in forming it.

Referring back to the Belfast Agreement of 1998 when negotiations bore fruit at the 11th hour, the Sinn Fein president,
Gerry Adams, described the current deal and the rescue of power-sharing as "yet another very good Friday".
Jeffrey Donaldson told the Guardian the DUP's 36-strong assembly team was now unanimously in favour of the deal.
But the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) has yet to officially back the package which will allow the assembly to set up
legislation to change the way parades are judged.
A UUP spokeswoman said members wanted to see the proposed agreement before giving their response to the two
governments. "We have not had sight of this agreement and until we do we will not be signing up to it," she said.
The talks, which centred on Hillsborough Castle, outside Belfast, are the longest set of continuous negotiations held in the
near 20-year peace process. Sinn Fein had accused the DUP of stalling on the transfer of policing powers for the last
three years and it was feared that failure to find agreement could see the collapse of the power-sharing government led by
the two parties.
The agreement finally came near midnight at Stormont's parliament building. Earlier in the evening Sinn Fein had said the
basis of a deal was on the table and it was giving the DUP leadership the time to persuade its party to accept it. Robinson
emerged from a meeting of party colleagues to confirm that he had secured unanimous support for the proposals. Earlier
in the week up to 14 DUP assembly members had opposed a proposed deal because it did not give unionists enough
concessions.
Robinson said he would now look to gain the support of the community and the smaller assembly parties for the deal. "We
have a basis upon which we can go forward and recommend it [the deal] to our party, to the other parties in Northern
Ireland and to the community.
"An essential element of the Democratic Unionist Party's manifesto is the requirement for community confidence; we
believe this can be the basis for gaining that confidence."
However the leader of the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), Jim Allister, questioned why the 14 DUP rebels had
changed their minds.
"The deal hasn't changed, only the snowmen of the DUP, who melted once the heat came on," Allister said.
The DUP now faces a struggle to ward off the TUV threat in the forthcoming general election: Allister will portray the deal
as a sell-out of unionist principles and a sop to republicanism.

Justice and policing powers will be devolved to Northern Ireland <http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/northernireland> 's
power-sharing government from 12 April in a historic deal agreed by the main parties that "opens a new chapter" after
decades of violence, Gordon Brown said today.
Standing alongside his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, at a press conference at Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast, the
prime minister said the "inspirational" agreement between Sinn Fein <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/sinn-fein>
and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/dup> was a foundation for lasting peace.

The deal — finally agreed to by the DUP <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/feb/05/northern-ireland-dup-ulster-
deal> last night and described as a final piece in the jigsaw after a long search for peace — comes after two weeks of
round-the-clock negotiations and brings an end to fears that the power-sharing government might collapse.
It will see policing and justice powers devolved from Westminster to the assembly within weeks and includes new plans
on overseeing parades.
Brown, who travelled to Belfast this morning, said the agreement had been possible because of "a new spirit of mutual
co-operation and respect".
The deal meets a key Sinn Fein demand and prevents the republican party from walking out of the power-sharing
executive. In return, the DUP has secured reforms to the way loyalist marches are handled in Northern Ireland, including
the abolition of the Parades Commission, a body most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists.
A cross-community vote will now be held in the Stormont assembly on 9 March before the policing and justice powers
are devolved from London on 12 April.
Brown told reporters: "The achievements have been as great as they are inspirational. This moment and this agreement
belongs to the people of Northern Ireland, all of the people, and now more than ever before so does their future ... This
is the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years of
talks, weeks of stalemate."
Cowen praised both unionists and nationalists for making "fair and balanced compromises" to bridge the divisions and
said the quality of the negotiations meant that the "devolved institutions can and will work".
The Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, said the deal would further isolate republican dissidents who have
launched three separate gun and bomb attacks against police stations in the province over the last 10 days. The deal
would "absolutely" make Northern Ireland a safer place, he said.
The DUP leader, Peter Robinson, said the agreement "will be more enduring because of the time spent" in forming it.

Obama Advisers to Aid Tories' Election TV
Battle
By IAIN MARTIN
Advisers close to U.S. President Barack Obama have been drafted by David Cameron to help the Conservatives in their
election campaign against Gordon Brown and Labour.
The Tories have signed a contract with Squier, Knapp, Dunn Communications—a Washington-based Democrat-leaning
political consultancy— to help them prepare for the first-ever television debates between leaders during a British election
camialin.
David Cameron
The firm also is expected to offer some advice more broadly to the Tory leader on the Conservative campaign in the lead-
up to voting, likely to take place on May 6.
Opinion polls have suggested a narrowing of the gap between the two main parties—with the Conservative lead cut to six
to seven points in the two most recent polls earlier this week.
A Conservative spokesman confirmed Wednesday night that Squier, Knapp, Dunn will act as consultants for the television
debates.
Anita Dunn, one of the firm's senior partners, was hired by Mr. Obama in 2006 ahead of his run for president and was the
communications director at the White House until November. Bill Knapp, another senior partner and veteran of the
successful Obama campaign, is a close adviser to the mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg.
Tory campaign insiders say they have been talking to the firm for several months after a recommendation from Mayor
Bloomberg, who retains close links with the British Tory leadership.
He was a lifelong Democrat who switched to the Republicans when he first ran for mayor.
The British general election is taking on a particularly American flavor, with the prime minister also understood to be
seeking advice from a consultant based in the U.S. The Times of London reported that Joel Benenson, a polling and
strategy adviser who worked on the team that readied Mr. Obama for the American TV debates, is helping Mr. Brown.
None of the British parties has experience of leaders' debates and as a consequence are looking outside for help.
However, it is the decision of the Tories to reach out across the traditional ideological divide to senior Democrats that is
surprising. Their party usually has looked to Republican strategists for advice, with Labour and the Democrats retaining
close links.
Ms. Dunn is a veteran of Democrat politics, beginning her career in Jimmy Carter's administration and subsequently
working as a consultant on many election campaigns. She returned to the White House with President Obama but left late

last year when her husband, Robert Bauer, the president's personal attorney, was unveiled as the incoming White House
counsel.
Mr. Knapp made television ads for the Obama campaign, has worked on five presidential campaigns and played a leading
role in Mayor Bloomberg's three election wins.
The pre-election atmosphere in the U.K. has become increasingly fraught, with the parties trading blows on allegations of
bullying inside No. 10 Downing Street made in a new book on the Labour government by journalist Andrew Rawnsley.
In the latest developments, the prime minister Wednesday in a GMTV breakfast television interview denied that he had
known about briefings by some of his aides against Alistair Darling, his chancellor of the exchequer.
In a remarkably frank interview Tuesday with Jeff Randall of Sky News, Mr. Darling said that when he remarked in the
summer of 2008 that the worst global recession in 60 years was underway, No. 10 had "unleashed the forces of hell."
Mr Brown said on GMTV: "I was never part of anything to do with this. Look, this was the most amazing time.. .and lots of
things were happening in this time. But I would never instruct anybody to do anything other than support my chancellor,
and I think Alistair will confirm that."
At a rowdy Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons Wednesday, Mr. Cameron questioned Mr. Brown on the
row.

Re: Backdrop to your coming week
Below is a piece published today in The Observer, the Sunday newspaper of The Guardian, on the Chilcot inquiry,
summarizing the testimony so far and what is expected this week while you are drumming up support for the
Afghanistan initiative. Britain and Europe are riveted by Chilcot, especially official circles. The objective correlative, of
course, is trust in any U.S. administration and deep skepticism about the Afghanistan project. Yet another undercurrent
among the mandarins is disdainful resentment of indifference to Britain, a sentiment beyond Labour or the Tories but
what has emerged as the view of the permanent establishment at Whitehall and elsewhere.
Mendelson Watch: After Miliband declined to reach for the EU foreign secretaryship (though Sarkozy wanted him to
take it and Brown was not averse, even favorable), Mendelson personally campaigned on his own for it among the
Europeans. !Mendelson was eager to Miliband to take the EU post, allowing Mendelson to be appointed foreign
minister. When Miliband refused, Mendelson's ambition was thwarted, and tried to seize the EU position for himself,
but without any backing in Europe or from Gordon. The Europeans thought him mad. Suddenly, they recalled his bad or
strange behavior as UK commissioner to the EU. When Christine Ashton was named, Mendelson briefed the press on her
lack of credentials, etc. Ashton, as it happens, had worked the press to try to help Mendelson when he had gotten into
the mess that led to his first resignation. Those inside the government who remember this see it as an illustration of the
principle that no good deed goes unpunished. Mendelson, in a snit, is now not speaking to Gordon as though his
rejection were Gordon's fault.
One more item: Did you read Jim Hoagland in the Washington Post today? He nails McDonough for trashing Biden,
among other things. Enclosed below story on Chilcot:
http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/nov/29/iraq-war-inquiry-chilcot-blair
Chilcot Inquiry: Mandarins take revenge on Tony Blair over Iraq Civil servants and diplomats are lining up to stick a knife
into former PM's reputation
* Toby Helm <http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tobyhelm> and Rajeev Syal
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/rajeev-syal>
* The Observer <http://observer.guardian.co.uk> , Sunday 29 November 2009
* Whitehall mandarins are supreme masters of subtle evasion. But they do not rise to the top of their trade without
also knowing how to stick in the knife.
At times the Chilcot inquiry into Britain's involvement in Iraq since 2001, which opened last week, resembled a
gentlemen's club moved to the sanitised surroundings of the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in Westminster.
Oxbridge-educated pillars of the establishment politely questioned other Oxbridge-educated pillars of the establishment
about who said what to whom in which memo. The inquiry is a peculiar mixture of the old and the new, the open and
closed. It is conducted in the language of Whitehall, yet beamed live by webcam to the world.
Critics are convinced that, for all Sir John Chilcot's promises to the contrary, it will turn out to be another Whitehall
whitewash. For the cognoscenti, little new information has yet emerged, and when the final report is written it will not
seek to apportion blame. Yet beneath the equivocation and mandarin-speak, Whitehall seems, in as much as it knows
how, to be using Chilcot to wield the scalpel. Throughout the first week the pent-up frustrations of diplomats and career
civil servants over the way Tony Blair <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/tonyblair> and George Bush secretly plotted
to oust Saddam Hussein, bypassing the "official channels" in which they operate, has been there for all to see.

Chilcot is said to have been warned by his Whitehall friends that many witnesses will be ready to unburden themselves -
finally to take revenge. In session after session they have appeared to do that. Blair's reputation has been sliced like
salami day after day.
Sir William Ehrman, the Foreign Office's former director of international security, volunteered last Wednesday that the
threat from Saddam's supposed weapons of mass destruction was known to be limited.
In the gentlest way he drove in the dagger. "We did, I think on 10 March [2003], get a report that chemical weapons
might have remained disassembled and Saddam hadn't yet ordered their assembly. There was a suggestion that Iraq
might lack warheads capable of effective dispersal of agents."
Ever the diplomat, however, Ehrman went on to say that the intelligence warnings had not made any difference to the
case for war. "I don't think it invalidated the point about the programmes he had. It was more about use," he said. But
he had set the tone.
On Thursday, Sir Christopher Meyer, UK ambassador in Washington from 1997 to 2003, who has already criticised the
government over Iraq in his memoirs, went for Blair, mercilessly comparing his qualities as a war leader to those of
Margaret Thatcher. "I'm not trying to make a party political point here whatsoever, but quite often I think about this:
what would Margaret Thatcher have done?" Meyer asked. "I think she would have insisted on a coherent political and
diplomatic strategy and she would have demanded the greatest clarity about what the heck happened if, and when, you
removed Saddam Hussein."
A former press secretary to John Major who can speak like a mandarin but, equally, can talk like a layman, he said Blair
had failed miserably to extract a price from George Bush for his loyalty. "We could have achieved more by playing a
tougher role... if, for example... Tony Blair had said: 'I want to help you, George, on this, but I have to say, in all honesty,
that I will not be able to take part in any military operation unless we have palpable progress on the [Middle East] peace
process and we have absolute clarity on what happens in Iraq if it comes up.' I think that would have changed the nature
— it would not have led to a rupture — it would have changed the nature of American planning. "
Even when defending UK policy, he was on the offensive. Asked if policy had been adapted to stay in line with
Washington's, Meyer added: "I wouldn't say it was as extremely poodle-ish as that."
On Friday, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's former ambassador to the United Nations, told Chilcot he had threatened to
resign in 2002 if at least one security council resolution was not passed. He added: "I regard our participation in the
military action in Iraq in March 2003 as legal but of questionable legitimacy, in that it did not have the democratically
observable backing of the great majority of [UN] member states, or even perhaps of the majority of people inside the
UK."
Today new arguments are raging over whether the inquiry will have access to, and publish, the most sensitive
documents — including legal advice given to the government by the former attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, during the
lead-up to war. Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader, has written to Gordon Brown saying that, unless all such
material is published, the inquiry will be a sham and the public's sense that it has been denied the facts will remain.
But it will still be essential viewing nonetheless. This week will see more key witnesses. The most revealing testimony
could come tomorrow when Sir David Manning, Blair's former foreign policy
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/foreignpolicy> adviser, is certain to be asked about his authorship of a memo
which purportedly revealed details of a secret meeting between Bush and Blair in January 2003. According to reports,
the five pages of secret documents, known as the Manning memo, recorded the White House meeting on 31 January
which allegedly shows that Bush and Blair made a deal to carry out an invasion regardless of whether weapons of mass
destruction were discovered by UN weapons inspectors. It appears to be in direct contradiction with statements that
Blair made to parliament afterwards that Saddam would be given a final chance to disarm.
The memo also disclosed that Bush floated the idea of painting a U-2 spyplane in UN colours and letting it fly low over
Iraq to provoke Saddam into ordering it to be shot down, providing a pretext for the subsequent invasion by America
and Britain.
Manning, educated at Oriel College, Oxford, and a career diplomat, is fiercely independent. He may choose to say more
than Blair would like, according to one former colleague. He could also be asked to either confirm or deny Meyer's
evidence that Meyer received "new instructions" in early 2005 indicating that it was a "complete waste of time" to
oppose regime change, so strong was the US determination to go down that road.
On Tuesday, Edward Chaplin, the Foreign Office Middle East director at the time of the invasion, and Sir Peter Ricketts,
the top official in the Foreign Office, will appear. Ricketts, a former chairman of Britain's powerful joint intelligence
committee, has already given evidence to the inquiry alleging that officials in London knew even before Bush came to
office in 2001 that there were "voices" in Washington calling for Saddam to be removed from power. Ricketts also told
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767432 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767432 Date: 07/31/2015
the inquiry that, until March 2002, Whitehall distanced itself from regime change. Only one month later, Blair told Bush
that he would support military action "to bring about regime change".
According to documents leaked five years ago, Ricketts described the US in 2002 as "scrambling to establish a link
between Iraq and al-Qaida" — a connection that was "so far, frankly unconvincing". On Thursday, Sir Kevin Tebbit, the
Ministry of Defence's permanent secretary during the invasion, will be asked to give evidence about the military
planning. Chilcot will, most likely, want to know when the government first began to amass resources for the war and
what, if any, preparations were made for the aftermath of an invasion. Tebbit could also be urged to divulge the level of
intelligence he received on the likelihood of an attack with chemical or biological weapons.
After Tebbit, a succession of heavy-hitting military men will give evidence. The former chief of the defence staff, Admiral
the Lord Boyce, could be asked whether he believes that the invasion was legal. On Friday, Lieutenant General Sir
Anthony Pigott, former deputy chief of the defence staff, and Major General David Wilson, senior British military adviser
to the US military's central command between 2002 and 2003, will be questioned about military planning for the
conflict.
The last witness to appear this week will be Dominic Asquith, Britain's ambassador to Iraq between 2006 and 2007, who
will come armed with knowledge of the view from Baghdad.
When Chilcot has made his way through the officials, he will turn in the new year to former ministers, including Jack
Straw, the former foreign secretary, and Blair himself. The panel has said that it will also begin to examine the highly
controversial issue of whether the invasion was legal — which may turn out to be the focal point of the whole inquiry — in
January.
In his final report, which is not expected until late 2010 at the earliest, Chilcot has said he will not seek to attribute
blame. But after only one week it is already clear where much of Whitehall believes that lies.
The Washington Post
Afghanistan: The speech you'll miss
By Jim Hoagland
Sunday, November 29, 2009
Dec. 1, 2009:
My fellow Americans,
This is not the speech you expected to hear. But my wordsmiths are tied in knots writing an acceptance speech for the
only Nobel Peace Prize ever awarded for making speeches. So I am going to tell you how I really feel about Afghanistan.
Which is: steamed.
I want to accomplish three goals tonight without naming them.
First, to let those know-it-alls, Generals Petraeus and McChrystal, know one more thing: This is the last big troop
increase you get, so make it work.
I am not going down the incrementalist road that wrecked Lyndon Johnson's presidency. This is not July 1965, when
Westmoreland jumped the shark of escalation in Vietnam and then never stopped asking for more troops. For all the
trouble he has been, Dick Holbrooke helped by recalling that history in the shadowboxing that dominated my long war
council meetings.
Joe Biden has been good in there, too. He's been willing, though not happy, to be characterized in the media as being
ready to bug out now. This helped us push back against McChrystal's effort to box me in at 40,000 additional U.S.
soldiers.
Denis McDonough, my strategic communications man, sold Biden-as-dove brilliantly. Wasn't somebody just saying I
should promote Denis? Maybe it was Denis?
Never mind. That tactic won me room to maneuver toward a more realistic number of, say, 23,000 new combat troops,
5,000 additional trainers and a "NATO surge" of 5,000 foreign troops.
That's my second unspoken goal: to come out of this buildup speech without losing the left of the Democratic Party--
while being able to refute John McCain's charges that I ignored my own generals. Triangulation lives.
Bush put the generals in the limelight to sell the Iraq surge after he lost all credibility, and David Petraeus's performance
was dazzling. Which presents two big problems. Petraeus is the only person who could get the Republican nomination in
2012 and make a serious run against me. (I get paid to think ahead.) And if the generals box me in, civilian control of the
military in this country becomes a mockery. Clinton was afraid of the military; Bush was deep in hock to it. I've got to get
the right balance back.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767432 Date: 07/31/2015
That's why I need Bob Gates and Jim Jones. Those who scoffed at my keeping on Bush's defense secretary, and then
making a retired Marine four-star I hardly knew my NSC guy, were not thinking that moments like this would come. I
already was.
Gates has maneuvered flawlessly through my waterboarding-by-leaks on Afghanistan. He will sell my final number to the
uniforms as the "floor" for U.S. troops that Petraeus argues we need for three years. But Gates knows I will make it a
ceiling.
We can't afford an open-ended commitment. I put Peter Orszag, as good a budget overseer as you can find, front and
center for the photographers in that last war council. Many missed it, but NBC's Andrea Mitchell got it right away. No
wonder she's married to Alan Greenspan.
I will bet that Stan McChrystal never drew up a budget in his life.
Jones tells me these Special Operations commanders are used to getting whatever they ask for, especially since
September 11th. Nobody on the Hill will deny them anything.
Jones is also squeezing the Europeans to join the battle and is getting results, even from the Germans. What is it Jones
says? Maybe the worst thing of all would be to be perceived to lose in Afghanistan and then have the Europeans say:
Well, you never asked for more help at the crucial time. Makes sense to me.
We have sent NATO members the numbers we think they can and should provide, country by country. That new
secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, is pulling out the stops, visiting the capitals to get commitments.
"Say it now, pay it later," we tell the Europeans. They have until mid-2010 to deploy their new units. But I need pledges
now so I can get across tonight that this is NATO's war, not Obama's war. That's' unspoken-goal number three.
So I have frontloaded the speech with allusions to this being about an exit strategy, without boxing myself in on timing,
and am presenting the "civilian surge" as being as essential as the troop buildup. That helps set up my Oslo speech. And
who knows? It may even work out that way. If God blesses us all.

Never mind. That tactic won me room to maneuver toward a more realistic number of, say, 23,000 new combat troops,
5,000 additional trainers and a "NATO surge" of 5,000 foreign troops.
That's my second unspoken goal: to come out of this buildup speech without losing the left of the Democratic Party --
while being able to refute John McCain's charges that I ignored my own generals. Triangulation lives.
Bush put the generals in the limelight to sell the Iraq surge after he lost all credibility, and David Petraeus's performance
was dazzling. Which presents two big problems. Petraeus is the only person who could get the Republican nomination in
2012 and make a serious run against me. (I get paid to think ahead.) And if the generals box me in, civilian control of the
military in this country becomes a mockery. Clinton was afraid of the military; Bush was deep in hock to it. I've got to get
the right balance back.

That's why I need Bob Gates and Jim Jones. Those who scoffed at my keeping on Bush's defense secretary, and then
making a retired Marine four-star I hardly knew my NSC guy, were not thinking that moments like this would come. I
already was.
Gates has maneuvered flawlessly through my waterboarding-by-leaks on Afghanistan. He will sell my final number to the
uniforms as the "floor" for U.S. troops that Petraeus argues we need for three years. But Gates knows I will make it a
ceiling.
We can't afford an open-ended commitment. I put Peter Orszag, as good a budget overseer as you can find, front and
center for the photographers in that last war council. Many missed it, but NBC's Andrea Mitchell got it right away. No
wonder she's married to Alan Greenspan.
I will bet that Stan McChrystal never drew up a budget in his life.
Jones tells me these Special Operations commanders are used to getting whatever they ask for, especially since
September 11th. Nobody on the Hill will deny them anything.
Jones is also squeezing the Europeans to join the battle and is getting results, even from the Germans. What is it Jones
says? Maybe the worst thing of all would be to be perceived to lose in Afghanistan and then have the Europeans say:
Well, you never asked for more help at the crucial time. Makes sense to me.
We have sent NATO members the numbers we think they can and should provide, country by country. That new
secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, is pulling out the stops, visiting the capitals to get commitments.
"Say it now, pay it later," we tell the Europeans. They have until mid-2010 to deploy their new units. But I need pledges
now so I can get across tonight that this is NATO's war, not Obarna's war. That's unspoken-goal number three.
So I have frontloaded the speech with allusions to this being about an exit strategy, without boxing myself in on timing,
and am presenting the "civilian surge" as being as essential as the troop buildup. That helps set up my Oslo speech. And
who knows? It may even work out that way. If God blesses us all.

Tony is somewhat downcast on his chances. (He met with Jim Hoagland of the Washington Post yesterday; his

becoming EU foreign secretary if Tony does not become EU president. Miliband denied he was interested and
endorsed Tony. This is part of the anti-Blair campaign ginned up by the Tories, extended to hurt Miliband if

Brown hails 'new chapter' in Northern Ireland
as end to years of violence
Promise of US investment follows 'momentous' agreement that seals power-sharing framework
• Henry McDonald, Ireland correspondent
• quardian.co.uk, Friday 5 February 2010 19.11 GMT

British and Irish PMs endorse power-sharing deal Link to this video
Northern Ireland's leaders have been rewarded with the promise of a new US investment programme after securing a
historic deal today which saved power sharing.
Gordon Brown and his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, flew into Northern Ireland to put their seal of approval on the deal,
which will create a Department of Justice, gives unionists concessions on the issue of Protestant parades and saves the
power-sharing executive from collapse.
Brown said the achievements over the longest period of unbroken negotiations since the peace process began 16 years
ago were inspirational.
"This is the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years
of talks, weeks of stalemate."
Tonight the White House said Barack Obama saw the deal as "an important step to greater peace and prosperity for all
communities on the island."
Obama would also meet Cowen, the DUP leader and first minister Peter Robinson and the deputy first minister, Sinn
Fein's Martin McGuinness, in Washington on St Patrick's Day next month.
Earlier, Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, said the agreement between the DUP and Sinn Fein was a "shining
example to other parts of the world locked in religious and ethnic conflicts".
As a result of the deal, she said: "The people of Northern Ireland are poised to build a thriving society on this stronger
foundation.
Our economic envoy, DecIan Kelly, will continue to help Northern Ireland reap the dividends of peace, including economic
growth, international investment and new opportunities. -
In the near future, Declan and I will host first minister Robinson and deputy first minister McGuinness in Washington."
The Irish prime minister said the agreement reached "presents a real opportunity to renew the partnership which is the life
blood of the devolved institutions. The people of Northern Ireland yearn for this constructive partnership to deliver tangible
outcomes that improve their lives."
Referring back to the Belfast agreement of 1998, Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, described today's agreement as
"yet another good Friday." After reaching an agreement just before midnight on Thursday, the parties in the Northern
Ireland assembly must now vote to put the compromise package in place. They will vote on 9 March to devolve policing
and justice powers, which will then create a justice ministry on 12 April — a key Sinn Fein demand throughout these
negotiations.
Under the agreement, a six-member working group, appointed by Robinson and McGuinness, will formulate a framework
for handling contentious marches and the phasing out of the Parades Commission.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767452 Date: 08/31/2015
The new body will encourage local people to find solutions to parading problems, with the rights of marchers and
residents taken into account. It will complete its work within three weeks, when the Northern Ireland executive will transfer
responsibilities for parading legislation from Westminster and table a new bill based on the group's proposals.
An executive working group will be set up, in the hands of the SDLP and Ulster Unionists, to improve the way the power-
sharing cabinet is run. Robinson and McGuinness will address issues still outstanding from the 2006 St Andrews
agreement that led to the DUP-Sinn Fein deals. These include legislative measures to protect the rights of Irish language
speakers.
Ian Paisley Jr, the North Antrim assembly member and son of the DUP's founder, described the agreement as a "win for
unionism".
Paisley said his party had negotiated the end of the Parades Commission, which most unionists regard as biased in
favour of nationalists. He added that unionist critics of the deal had "no alternative except the imposition of joint authority
from London and Dublin".
Mindful of attacks on the DUP by the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice, Robinson said: "There are some who will play
politics with this agreement, but the real focus in the months to come must be on building an administration at Stormont
that our whole community identifies with and supports."
Jim Allister, the TUV leader and a former DUP MEP, said he was "relishing the prospect" of a general election contest
with his former party. Allister will stand for the TUV in Ian Paisley Sr's North Antrim constituency.
"In football terms I see this result as a five to one win for Sinn Fein. They get their date for policing and justice. Secondly,
their veto can be exercised over the justice ministry. They now have working party on Irish language. North/South bodies
are strengthened. And finally there is a stronger north-south parliamentary forum. The DUP only get a view of parading
issues.
"Sinn Fein are laughing all the way to the next staging post," he said.
Shaun Woodward, the Northern Ireland secretary, said the deal was bad news for republican dissidents determined to
destabilise the power-sharing government.
He said a powerful message was being sent out to the dissidents that there are now "two groups of people who were once
terrible rivals [who] have found a way through a very big challenge".
But the Real IRA, Continuity IRA and Oglaigh na hEireann are unlikely to be moved by the accord at Hillsborough. In the
past seven days the republican dissidents have carried out three gun and bomb attacks on police stations across
Northern Ireland.
Republican sources have told the Guardian that the groups are likely to intensify their armed campaigns when policing
and justice powers are transferred to Belfast.

EU leaders to debate Blair presidency on
summit sidelines
Climate talks overshadowed by divisive subject of Tony Blair's candidacy to be Europe's first president
European government chiefs gather in Brussels this evening for a summit likely to be the first occasion to broach the
divisive subject of Tony Blair's candidacy to be Europe's first president.
The topic is not formally on the agenda of a meeting that will be dominated by wrangling over climate change funding and
how to get the Czech president, Vaclav Klaus, to add the final signature to the reformist Lisbon treaty. But senior
diplomats predicted there would be intense private discussion on the fringes of the summit over the question: who will get
the plum job of first sitting president of the European council, the pre-eminent EU forum that brings leaders together for
summits at least four times a year.
David Miliband, the foreign secretary, said today that Blair would give Europe a "strong voice" on the global stage, but his
comments were seized on by his Conservative shadow, William Hague, who said the debate over the presidency proved
that the UK should have held a referendum on the Lisbon treaty.
Officially, the job does not exist until Klaus finalises Czech ratification of the treaty, expected within weeks. While Blair
personally has kept quiet about his ambitions, the British government is campaigning increasingly assertively on the
former prime minister's behalf.
"We will be making the case for a strong, internationally known figure who can open doors in [foreign] capitals," said an
official. "There is only one candidate."
That was not a reference to Jean-Claude Juncker, the veteran Luxembourg prime minister and European fixer, who is the
only contender so far to have openly declared his candidacy. He emerged this week as the anti-Blair.
Juncker looks certain to fail in his bid for the top job. But he may well succeed in destroying Blair's chances, being viewed
as a stalking horse who will vanish to make way for a third unknown contender.
While the Blair debate rages on the sidelines of the summit, the big priority for the Swedish government chairing the
meeting is to try to break a deadlock on EU funding of climate change programmes in the developing world ahead of the
Copenhagen conference in December.
Berlin and Warsaw are the keys to a deal, but the prospects for a breakthrough look dim. Fredrik Reinfeldt, the Swedish
prime minister, warned that Europe's credibility on global warming was at stake.
In recent weeks European governments have locked horns over the financing package and have been unable to reach
agreement. The aim is to come up with pledges of an EU fund of up to €15bn (£13.4bn) a year by 2020 for transfers to the
developing countries to combat global warming. The overall package is central to a Copenhagen deal.
But with the other big players, especially the US, which is reluctant to commit to a figure, Germany believes Europe
should not show its hand until the Copenhagen negotiations. The European commission and others such as the UK and
the Scandinavians believe agreeing on a figure in advance would strengthen Europe's global leadership role on climate
change and send a strong signal to other potential signatories.
The Poles and other eastern Europeans are unhappy at being asked to stump up for developing countries such as Brazil,
which is wealthier than the poorer EU members. The Poles are refusing to agree a package and figures for Copenhagen
unless it is first decided how the bill will be split among the EU's 27 governments. In the midst of a financial crisis, the
eastern Europeans say they cannot afford the climate change fund.
Angela Merkel, sworn in yesterday for a second term as German chancellor, will be pivotal to any climate change
financing deal and her answer to the Blair question may also be decisive. So far, she has been hedging her bets.

While Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, is known to support Blair with reservations, there are no German candidates
for the two big new jobs being created under Lisbon — the European president and a European foreign minister or high
representative for foreign and security policy.
In Paris last night the French and German leaders discussed the posts, although there was little information on whether
they reached a pact. Sarkozy said the two leaders agreed on "almost everything".
Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg — all said to nurse ambitions to secure the presidential post
themselves — have come out publicly against Blair on the grounds that he would neglect the interests of smaller EU
member states — 19 out of the total 27.
Adding his voice to the argument, Demitris Christofias, the president of Cyprus, said a council president "from a small
country would be more objective and more consensual. The European Union is a family of compromises."
The Dutch centre-right prime minister and possible contender, Jan-Peter Balkenende, has come under pressure this week
to renounce European presidential ambitions since his move to Brussels could trigger early elections and the fall of his
government.
Christofias emphasised that tonight the priority would be to get the Klaus blocking of the Lisbon treaty lifted rather than
focusing on who gets what under Lisbon.
Senior diplomats agreed it was too early to discuss names. If Klaus signs thetreaty soon, a special summit would be
convened next month to decide on the president and foreign minister, also leaving the European commission chief, Jose
Manuel Barroso, to put together a new team.

Re: Backdrop to your coming week
Below is a piece published today in The Observer, the Sunday newspaper of The Guardian, on the Chilcot inquiry,
summarizing the testimony so far and what is expected this week while you are drumming up support for the
Afghanistan initiative. Britain and Europe are riveted by Chilcot, especially official circles. The objective correlative, of
course, is trust in any U.S. administration and deep skepticism about the Afghanistan project. Yet another undercurrent
among the mandarins is disdainful resentment of indifference to Britain, a sentiment beyond Labour or the Tories but
what has emerged as the view of the permanent establishment at Whitehall and elsewhere.
Mandelson Watch: After Miliband declined to reach for the EU foreign secretaryship (though Sarkozy wanted him to
take it and Brown was not averse, even favorable), Mandelson personally campaigned on his own for it among the
Europeans. Mandelson was eager to Miliband to take the EU post, allowing Mandelson to be appointed foreign
minister. When Miliband refused, Mandelson's ambition was thwarted, and tried to seize the EU position for himself,
but without any backing in Europe or from Gordon. The Europeans thought him mad. Suddenly, they recalled his bad or
strange behavior as UK commissioner to the EU. When Christine Ashton was named, Mandelson briefed the press on her
lack of credentials, etc. Ashton, as it happens, had worked the press to try to help Mandelson when he had gotten into
the mess that led to his first resignation. Those inside the government who remember this see it as an illustration of the
principle that no good deed goes unpunished. Mandelson, in a snit, is now not speaking to Gordon as though his
rejection were Gordon's fault.
One more item: Did you read Jim Hoagland in the Washington Post today? He nails McDonough for trashing Biden,
among other things. Enclosed below story on Chilcot:
http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/nov/29/iraq-war-inquiry-chilcot-blair
Chilcot Inquiry: Mandarins take revenge on Tony Blair over Iraq Civil servants and diplomats are lining up to stick a knife
into former PM's reputation
* Toby Helm <http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tobyhelm> and Rajeev Syal
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/rajeev-syal>
* The Observer <http://observerguardian.co.uk> , Sunday 29 November 2009
* Whitehall mandarins are supreme masters of subtle evasion. But they do not rise to the top of their trade without
also knowing how to stick in the knife.
At times the Chilcot inquiry into Britain's involvement in Iraq since 2001, which opened last week, resembled a
gentlemen's club moved to the sanitised surroundings of the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in Westminster.
Oxbridge-educated pillars of the establishment politely questioned other Oxbridge-educated pillars of the establishment
about who said what to whom in which memo. The inquiry is a peculiar mixture of the old and the new, the open and
closed. It is conducted in the language of Whitehall, yet beamed live by webcam to the world.
Critics are convinced that, for all Sir John Chilcot's promises to the contrary, it will turn out to be another Whitehall
whitewash. For the cognoscenti, little new information has yet emerged, and when the final report is written it will not
seek to apportion blame. Yet beneath the equivocation and mandarin-speak, Whitehall seems, in as much as it knows
how, to be using Chilcot to wield the scalpel. Throughout the first week the pent-up frustrations of diplomats and career
civil servants over the way Tony Blair <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/tonyblair> and George Bush secretly plotted
to oust Saddam Hussein, bypassing the "official channels" in which they operate, has been there for all to see.

Chilcot is said to have been warned by his Whitehall friends that many witnesses will be ready to unburden themselves -
finally to take revenge. In session after session they have appeared to do that. Blair's reputation has been sliced like
salami day after day.
Sir William Ehrman, the Foreign Office's former director of international security, volunteered last Wednesday that the
threat from Saddam's supposed weapons of mass destruction was known to be limited.
In the gentlest way he drove in the dagger. "We did, I think on 10 March [2003], get a report that chemical weapons
might have remained disassembled and Saddam hadn't yet ordered their assembly. There was a suggestion that Iraq
might lack warheads capable of effective dispersal of agents."
Ever the diplomat, however, Ehrman went on to say that the intelligence warnings had not made any difference to the
case for war. "I don't think it invalidated the point about the programmes he had. It was more about use," he said. But
he had set the tone.
On Thursday, Sir Christopher Meyer, UK ambassador in Washington from 1997 to 2003, who has already criticised the
government over Iraq in his memoirs, went for Blair, mercilessly comparing his qualities as a war leader to those of
Margaret Thatcher. "I'm not trying to make a party political point here whatsoever, but quite often I think about this:
what would Margaret Thatcher have done?" Meyer asked. "I think she would have insisted on a coherent political and
diplomatic strategy and she would have demanded the greatest clarity about what the heck happened if, and when, you
removed Saddam Hussein."
A former press secretary to John Major who can speak like a mandarin but, equally, can talk like a layman, he said Blair
had failed miserably to extract a price from George Bush for his loyalty. "We could have achieved more by playing a
tougher role... if, for example... Tony Blair had said: 'I want to help you, George, on this, but I have to say, in all honesty,
that I will not be able to take part in any military operation unless we have palpable progress on the [Middle East] peace
process and we have absolute clarity on what happens in Iraq if it comes up.' I think that would have changed the nature
-- it would not have led to a rupture — it would have changed the nature of American planning. "
Even when defending UK policy, he was on the offensive. Asked if policy had been adapted to stay in line with
Washington's, Meyer added: "I wouldn't say it was as extremely poodle-ish as that."
On Friday, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's former ambassador to the United Nations, told Chilcot he had threatened to
resign in 2002 if at least one security council resolution was not passed. He added: "I regard our participation in the
military action in Iraq in March 2003 as legal but of questionable legitimacy, in that it did not have the democratically
observable backing of the great majority of [UN] member states, or even perhaps of the majority of people inside the
UK."
Today new arguments are raging over whether the inquiry will have access to, and publish, the most sensitive
documents — including legal advice given to the government by the former attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, during the
lead-up to war. Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader, has written to Gordon Brown saying that, unless all such
material is published, the inquiry will be a sham and the public's sense that it has been denied the facts will remain.
But it will still be essential viewing nonetheless. This week will see more key witnesses. The most revealing testimony
could come tomorrow when Sir David Manning, Blair's former foreign policy
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/foreignpolicy> adviser, is certain to be asked about his authorship of a memo
which purportedly revealed details of a secret meeting between Bush and Blair in January 2003. According to reports,
the five pages of secret documents, known as the Manning memo, recorded the White House meeting on 31 January
which allegedly shows that Bush and Blair made a deal to carry out an invasion regardless of whether weapons of mass
destruction were discovered by UN weapons inspectors. It appears to be in direct contradiction with statements that
Blair made to parliament afterwards that Saddam would be given a final chance to disarm.
The memo also disclosed that Bush floated the idea of painting a U-2 spyplane in UN colours and letting it fly low over
Iraq to provoke Saddam into ordering it to be shot down, providing a pretext for the subsequent invasion by America
and Britain.
Manning, educated at Oriel College, Oxford, and a career diplomat, is fiercely independent. He may choose to say more
than Blair would like, according to one former colleague. He could also be asked to either confirm or deny Meyer's
evidence that Meyer received "new instructions" in early 2005 indicating that it was a "complete waste of time" to
oppose regime change, so strong was the US determination to go down that road.
On Tuesday, Edward Chaplin, the Foreign Office Middle East director at the time of the invasion, and Sir Peter Ricketts,
the top official in the Foreign Office, will appear. Ricketts, a former chairman of Britain's powerful joint intelligence
committee, has already given evidence to the inquiry alleging that officials in London knew even before Bush came to
office in 2001 that there were "voices" in Washington calling for Saddam to be removed from power. Ricketts also told
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767479 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767479 Date: 07/31/2015
the inquiry that, until March 2002, Whitehall distanced itself from regime change. Only one month later, Blair told Bush
that he would support military action "to bring about regime change".
According to documents leaked five years ago, Ricketts described the US in 2002 as "scrambling to establish a link
between Iraq and al-Qaida" — a connection that was "so far, frankly unconvincing". On Thursday, Sir Kevin Tebbit, the
Ministry of Defence's permanent secretary during the invasion, will be asked to give evidence about the military
planning. Chilcot will, most likely, want to know when the government first began to amass resources for the war and
what, if any, preparations were made for the aftermath of an invasion. Tebbit could also be urged to divulge the level of
intelligence he received on the likelihood of an attack with chemical or biological weapons.
After Tebbit, a succession of heavy-hitting military men will give evidence. The former chief of the defence staff, Admiral
the Lord Boyce, could be asked whether he believes that the invasion was legal. On Friday, Lieutenant General Sir
Anthony Pigott, former deputy chief of the defence staff, and Major General David Wilson, senior British military adviser
to the US military's central command between 2002 and 2003, will be questioned about military planning for the
conflict.
The last witness to appear this week will be Dominic Asquith, Britain's ambassador to Iraq between 2006 and 2007, who
will come armed with knowledge of the view from Baghdad.
When Chilcot has made his way through the officials, he will turn in the new year to former ministers, including Jack
Straw, the former foreign secretary, and Blair himself. The panel has said that it will also begin to examine the highly
controversial issue of whether the invasion was legal — which may turn out to be the focal point of the whole inquiry — in
January.
In his final report, which is not expected until late 2010 at the earliest, Chilcot has said he will not seek to attribute
blame. But after only one week it is already clear where much of Whitehall believes that lies.

Afghanistan: The speech you'll miss
By Jim Hoagland
Sunday, November 29, 2009
Dec. 1, 2009:
My fellow Americans,
This is not the speech you expected to hear. But my wordsmiths are tied in knots writing an acceptance speech for the
only Nobel Peace Prize ever awarded for making speeches. So I am going to tell you how I really feel about Afghanistan.
Which is: steamed.
I want to accomplish three goals tonight without naming them.
First, to let those know-it-alls, Generals Petraeus and McChrystal, know one more thing: This is the last big troop
increase you get, so make it work.
am not going down the incrementalist road that wrecked Lyndon Johnson's presidency. This is not July 1965, when
Westmoreland jumped the shark of escalation in Vietnam and then never stopped asking for more troops. For all the
trouble he has been, Dick Holbrooke helped by recalling that history in the shadowboxing that dominated my long war
council meetings.
Joe Biden has been good in there, too. He's been willing, though not happy, to be characterized in the media as being
ready to bug out now. This helped us push back against McChrystal's effort to box me in at 40,000 additional U.S.
soldiers.
Denis McDonough, my strategic communications man, sold Biden-as-dove brilliantly. Wasn't somebody just saying I
should promote Denis? Maybe it was Denis?
Never mind. That tactic won me room to maneuver toward a more realistic number of, say, 23,000 new combat troops,
5,000 additional trainers and a "NATO surge" of 5,000 foreign troops.
That's my second unspoken goal: to come out of this buildup speech without losing the left of the Democratic Party --
while being able to refute John McCain's charges that I ignored my own generals. Triangulation lives.
Bush put the generals in the limelight to sell the Iraq surge after he lost all credibility, and David Petraeus's performance
was dazzling. Which presents two big problems. Petraeus is the only person who could get the Republican nomination in
2012 and make a serious run against me. (I get paid to think ahead.) And if the generals box me in, civilian control of the
military in this country becomes a mockery. Clinton was afraid of the military; Bush was deep in hock to it. I've got to get
the right balance back.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767479 Date: 07/31/2015
That's why I need Bob Gates and Jim Jones. Those who scoffed at my keeping on Bush's defense secretary, and then
making a retired Marine four-star I hardly knew my NSC guy, were not thinking that moments like this would come. I
already was.
Gates has maneuvered flawlessly through my waterboarding-by-leaks on Afghanistan. He will sell my final number to the
uniforms as the "floor" for U.S. troops that Petraeus argues we need for three years. But Gates knows I will make it a
ceiling.
We can't afford an open-ended commitment. I put Peter Orszag, as good a budget overseer as you can find, front and
center for the photographers in that last war council. Many missed it, but NBC's Andrea Mitchell got it right away. No
wonder she's married to Alan Greenspan.
I will bet that Stan McChrystal never drew up a budget in his life.
Jones tells me these Special Operations commanders are used to getting whatever they ask for, especially since
September 11th. Nobody on the Hill will deny them anything.
Jones is also squeezing the Europeans to join the battle and is getting results, even from the Germans. What is it Jones
says? Maybe the worst thing of all would be to be perceived to lose in Afghanistan and then have the Europeans say:
Well, you never asked for more help at the crucial time. Makes sense to me.
We have sent NATO members the numbers we think they can and should provide, country by country. That new
secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, is pulling out the stops, visiting the capitals to get commitments.
"Say it now, pay it later," we tell the Europeans. They have until mid-2010 to deploy their new units. But I need pledges
now so I can get across tonight that this is NATO's war, not Obama's war. That's unspoken-goal number three.
So I have frontloaded the speech with allusions to this being about an exit strategy, without boxing myself in on timing,
and am presenting the "civilian surge" as being as essential as the troop buildup. That helps set up my Oslo speech. And
who knows? It may even work out that way. If God blesses us all.

Re: Backdrop to your coming week
Below is a piece published today in The Observer, the Sunday newspaper of The Guardian, on the Chilcot inquiry,
summarizing the testimony so far and what is expected this week while you are drumming up support for the
Afghanistan initiative. Britain and Europe are riveted by Chilcot, especially official circles. The objective correlative, of
course, is trust in any U.S. administration and deep skepticism about the Afghanistan project. Yet another undercurrent
among the mandarins is disdainful resentment of indifference to Britain, a sentiment beyond Labour or the Tories but
what has emerged as the view of the permanent establishment at Whitehall and elsewhere.
Mandelson Watch: After Miliband declined to reach for the EU foreign secretaryship (though Sarkozy wanted him to
take it and Brown was not averse, even favorable), Mandelson personally campaigned on his own for it among the
Europeans. Mandelson was eager to Miliband to take the EU post, allowing Mandelson to be appointed foreign
minister. When Miliband refused, Mandelson's ambition was thwarted, and tried to seize the EU position for himself,
but without any backing in Europe or from Gordon. The Europeans thought him mad. Suddenly, they recalled his bad or
strange behavior as UK commissioner to the EU. When Christine Ashton was named, IVIandelson briefed the press on her
lack of credentials, etc. Ashton, as it happens, had worked the press to try to help Mandelson when he had gotten into
the mess that led to his first resignation. Those inside the government who remember this see it as an illustration of the
principle that no good deed goes unpunished. Mandelson, in a snit, is now not speaking to Gordon as though his
rejection were Gordon's fault.
One more item: Did you read Jim Hoagland in the Washington Post today? He nails McDonough for trashing Biden,
among other things. Enclosed below story on Chilcot:

Chilcot Inquiry: Mandarins take revenge on Tony Blair over Iraq Civil servants and diplomats are lining up to stick a knife
into former PM's reputation

<http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/rajeev-syal>
* The Observer <http://observerguardian.co.uk> , Sunday 29 November 2009
* Whitehall mandarins are supreme masters of subtle evasion. But they do not rise to the top of their trade without
also knowing how to stick in the knife.
At times the Chilcot inquiry into Britain's involvement in Iraq since 2001, which opened last week, resembled a
gentlemen's club moved to the sanitised surroundings of the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in Westminster.
Oxbridge-educated pillars of the establishment politely questioned other Oxbridge-educated pillars of the establishment
about who said what to whom in which memo. The inquiry is a peculiar mixture of the old and the new, the open and
closed. It is conducted in the language of Whitehall, yet beamed live by webcam to the world.
Critics are convinced that, for all Sir John Chilcot's promises to the contrary, it will turn out to be another Whitehall
whitewash. For the cognoscenti, little new information has yet emerged, and when the final report is written it will not
seek to apportion blame. Yet beneath the equivocation and mandarin-speak, Whitehall seems, in as much as it knows
how, to be using Chilcot to wield the scalpel. Throughout the first week the pent-up frustrations of diplomats and career
civil servants over the way Tony Blair <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/tonyblair> and George Bush secretly plotted
to oust Saddam Hussein, bypassing the "official channels" in which they operate, has been there for all to see.
Chilcot is said to have been warned by his Whitehall friends that many witnesses will be ready to unburden themselves -
finally to take revenge. In session after session they have appeared to do that. Blair's reputation has been sliced like
salami day after day.
Sir William Ehrman, the Foreign Office's former director of international security, volunteered last Wednesday that the
threat from Saddam's supposed weapons of mass destruction was known to be limited.
In the gentlest way he drove in the dagger. "We did, I think on 10 March [2003], get a report that chemical weapons
might have remained disassembled and Saddam hadn't yet ordered their assembly. There was a suggestion that Iraq
might lack warheads capable of effective dispersal of agents."
Ever the diplomat, however, Ehrman went on to say that the intelligence warnings had not made any difference to the
case for war. "I don't think it invalidated the point about the programmes he had. It was more about use," he said. But
he had set the tone.
On Thursday, Sir Christopher Meyer, UK ambassador in Washington from 1997 to 2003, who has already criticised the
government over Iraq in his memoirs, went for Blair, mercilessly comparing his qualities as a war leader to those of
Margaret Thatcher. "I'm not trying to make a party political point here whatsoever, but quite often I think about this:
what would Margaret Thatcher have done?" Meyer asked. "I think she would have insisted on a coherent political and
diplomatic strategy and she would have demanded the greatest clarity about what the heck happened if, and when, you
removed Saddam Hussein."
A former press secretary to John Major who can speak like a mandarin but, equally, can talk like a layman, he said Blair
had failed miserably to extract a price from George Bush for his loyalty. "We could have achieved more by playing a
tougher role... if, for example... Tony Blair had said: 'I want to help you, George, on this, but I have to say, in all honesty,
that I will not be able to take part in any military operation unless we have palpable progress on the [Middle East] peace
process and we have absolute clarity on what happens in Iraq if it comes up.' I think that would have changed the nature
— it would not have led to a rupture — it would have changed the nature of American planning. "
Even when defending UK policy, he was on the offensive. Asked if policy had been adapted to stay in line with
Washington's, Meyer added: "I wouldn't say it was as extremely poodle-ish as that."
On Friday, Sir Jeremy Greenstbck, Britain's former ambassador to the United Nations, told Chilcot he had threatened to
resign in 2002 if at least one security council resolution was not passed. He added: "I regard our participation in the
military action in Iraq in March 2003 as legal but of questionable legitimacy, in that it did not have the democratically
observable backing of the great majority of [UN] member states, or even perhaps of the majority of people inside the
UK."
Today new arguments are raging over whether the inquiry will have access to, and publish, the most sensitive
documents — including legal advice given to the government by the former attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, during the
lead-up to war. Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader, has written to Gordon Brown saying that, unless ail such
material is published, the inquiry will be a sham and the public's sense that it has been denied the facts will remain.
But it will still be essential viewing nonetheless. This week will see more key witnesses. The most revealing testimony
could come tomorrow when Sir David Manning, Blair's former foreign policy

<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politicsfforeignpolicy> adviser, is certain to be asked about his authorship of a memo
which purportedly revealed details of a secret meeting between Bush and Blair in January 2003. According to reports,
the five pages of secret documents, known as the Manning memo, recorded the White House meeting on 31 January
which allegedly shows that Bush and Blair made a deal to carry out an invasion regardless of whether weapons of mass
destruction were discovered by UN weapons inspectors. It appears to be in direct contradiction with statements that
Blair made to parliament afterwards that Saddam would be given a final chance to disarm.
The memo also disclosed that Bush floated the idea of painting a U-2 spyplane in UN colours and letting it fly low over
Iraq to provoke Saddam into ordering it to be shot down, providing a pretext for the subsequent invasion by America
and Britain.
Manning, educated at Oriel College, Oxford, and a career diplomat, is fiercely independent. He may choose to say more
than Blair would like, according to one former colleague. He could also be asked to either confirm or deny Meyer's
evidence that Meyer received "new instructions" in early 2005 indicating that it was a "complete waste of time to
oppose regime change, so strong was the US determination to go down that road.
On Tuesday, Edward Chaplin, the Foreign Office Middle East director at the time of the invasion, and Sir Peter Ricketts,
the top official in the Foreign Office, will appear. Ricketts, a former chairman of Britain's powerful joint intelligence
committee, has already given evidence to the inquiry alleging that officials in London knew even before Bush came to
office in 2001 that there were "voices" in Washington calling for Saddam to be removed from power. Ricketts also told
the inquiry that, until March 2002, Whitehall distanced itself from regime change. Only one month later, Blair told Bush
that he would support military action "to bring about regime change".
According to documents leaked five years ago, Ricketts described the US in 2002 as "scrambling to establish a link
between Iraq and al-Qaida" — a connection that was "so far, frankly unconvincing". Or. Thursday, Sir Kevin Tebbit, the
Ministry of Defence's permanent secretary during the invasion, will be asked to give evidence about the military
planning. Chilcot will, most likely, want to know when the government first began to amass resources for the war and
what, if any, preparations were made for the aftermath of an invasion. Tebbit could also be urged to divulge the level of
intelligence he received on the likelihood of an attack with chemical or biological weapons.
After Tebbit, a succession of heavy-hitting military men will give evidence. The former chief of the defence staff, Admiral
the Lord Boyce, could be asked whether he believes that the invasion was legal. On Friday, Lieutenant Genera! Sir
Anthony Pigott, former deputy chief of the defence staff, and Major General David Wilson, senior British military adviser
to the US military's central command between 2002 and 2003, will be questioned about military planning for the
conflict.
The last witness to appear this week will be Dominic Asquith, Britain's ambassador to Iraq between 2006 and 2007, who

controversial issue of whether the invasion was legal — which may turn out to be the focal point of the whole inquiry — in

Re: Another memo on backdrop to this week. Sid

Editorial
Diplomacy 101
We were thrilled when President Obama decided to plunge fully into the Middle East peace effort. He appointed a skilled
special envoy, George Mitchell, and demanded that Israel freeze settlements, Palestinians crack down on anti-Israel
violence and Arab leaders demonstrate their readiness to reach out to Israel.
Nine months later, the president's promising peace initiative has unraveled.
The Israelis have refused to stop ail building. The Palestinians say that they won't talk to the Israelis until they do, and
President Mahmoud Abbas is so despondent he has threatened to quit. Arab states are refusing to do anything.
Mr. Obama's own credibility is so diminished (his approval rating in Israel is 4 percent) that serious negotiations may be
farther off than ever.
Peacemaking takes strategic skill. But we see no sign that President Obama and Mr. Mitchell were thinking more than one
move down the board. The president went public with his demand for a full freeze on settlements before securing Israel's
commitment. And he and his aides apparently had no plan for what they would do if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said no.
Most important, they allowed the controversy to obscure the real goal: nudging Israel and the Palestinians into peace
talks. (We don't know exactly what happened but we are told that Mr. Obama relied more on the judgment of his political
advisers — specifically his chief of staff, Rehm Emanuel -- than of his Mideast specialists.)
The idea made sense: have each side do something tangible to prove it was serious about peace and then start
negotiations. But when Mr. Netanyahu refused the total freeze, President Obama backed down.
Mr. Netanyahu has since offered a compromise 10-month freeze that exempts Jerusalem, schools and synagogues and
permits Israel to complete 3,000 housing units already under construction. The irony is that while this offer goes beyond
what past Israeli governments accepted, Mr. Obama had called for more. And the Palestinians promptly rejected the
compromise.
Washington isn't the only one to blow it. After pushing President Obama to lead the peace effort, Arab states, especially
Saudi Arabia, refused to make any concessions until settlements were halted. Mr. Mitchell was asking them to allow Israel
to fly commercial planes through Arab airspace or open a trade office. They have also done far too little to strengthen Mr.
Abbas, who is a weak leader but is still the best hope for negotiating a peace deal. Ditto for Washington and Israel.
All this raises two questions: What has President Obama learned from the experience so he can improve his diplomatic
performance generally? And does he plan to revive the peace talks?
The president has no choice but to keep trying. At some point extremists will try to provoke another war. and the absence
of a dialogue will only make things worse. Advancing his own final-status plan for a two-state solution is one high-risk way
forward that we think is worth the gamble. Stalemate is unsustainable.

secretaryship (though Sarkozy wanted him to take it and Brown was not averse,
even favorable), Mandelson personally campaigned on his own for it among the
Europeans. Mandelson was eager to Miliband to take the EU post, allowing
Mandelson to be appointed foreign minister. When Miliband refused, Mandelson's
ambition was thwarted, and tried to seize the EU position for himself, but
without any backing in Europe or from Gordon. The Europeans thought him mad.
Suddenly, they recalled his had or strange behavior as UK commissioner to the
EU. When Christine Ashton was named, Mandelson briefed the press on her lack of
credentials, etc. Ashton, as it happens, had worked the press to try to help
Mandelson when he had gotten into the mess that led to his first resignation.
Those inside the government who remember this see it as an illustration of the
principle that no good deed goes unpunished. Mandelson, in a snit, is now not
speaking to Gordon as though his rejection were Gordon's fault.

Chilcot Inquiry: Mandarins take revenge on Tony Blair over Iraq
Civil servants and diplomats are lining up to stick a knife into former PM's
reputation

The Observer <httQ://observar.guardianco.uk> , Sunday 29 November 2009
Whitehall mandarins are supreme masters of subtle evasion. But they do
not rise to the top of their trade without also knowing how to stick in the
knife.
At times the Chilcot inquiry into Britain's involvement in Iraq since 2001,
which opened last week, resembled a gentlemen's club moved to the_ sanitised
surroundings of the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in Westminster.
Oxbridge-educated pillars of the establishment politely questioned other
Oxbridge-educated pillars of the establishment about who said what to whom in
which memo. The inquiry is a peculiar mixture of the old and the new, the open
and closed. It is conducted in the language of Whitehall, yet beamed live by
webcam to the world.
Critics are convinced that, for all Sir John Chilcot's promises to the contrary,
it will turn out to be another Whitehall whitewash. For the cognoscenti, little
new information has yet emerged, and when the final report is written it will
not seek to apportion blame. Yet beneath the equivocation and mandarin-speak,
Whitehall seems, in as much as it knows how, to be using Chilcot to wield the
scalpel. Throughout the first week the pent-up frustrations of diplomats and
career civil servants over the way Tony Blair
<htn.//www civardLan.so.ukl/politics/tonybiair>
and George Bush secretly plotted to oust Saddam Hussein, bypassing the "official
channels" in which they operate, has been there for all to see.
Chilcot is said to have been warned by his Whitehall friends that many witnesses

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767482 Date: 07/31/2015
will be ready to unburden themselves - finally to take revenge. In session after
session they have appeared to do that. Blair's reputation has been sliced like
salami day after day.
Sir William Ehrman, the Foreign Office's forMer director of international
security, volunteered last Wednesday that the threat from Saddam's supposed
weapons of mass destruction was known to be limited.
In the gentlest way he drove in the dagger. "We did, I think on 10 March [2003],
get a report that chemical weapons might have remained disassembled and Saddam
hadn't yet ordered their assembly. There was a suggestion that Iraq might lack
warheads capable of effective dispersal of agents."
Ever the diplomat, however, Ehrman went on to say that the intelligence warnings
had not made any difference to the case for war. "I don't think it invalidated
the point about the programmes he had. It was more about use," he said. But he
had set the tone.
On Thursday, Sir Christopher Meyer, UK ambassador in Washington from 1997 to
2003, who has already criticised the government over Iraq in his memoirs, went
for Blair, mercilessly comparing his qualities as a war leader to those of
Margaret Thatcher. "I'm not trying to make a party political point here
whatsoever, but quite often I think about this: what would Margaret Thatcher
have done?" Meyer asked. "I think she would have insisted on a coherent
political and diplomatic strategy and she would have demanded the greatest
clarity about what the heck happened if, and when, you removed Saddam Hussein."
A former press secretary to John Major who can speak like a mandarin but,
equally, can talk like a layman, he said Blair had failed miserably to extract a
price from George Bush for his loyalty. "We could have achieved more by playing
a tougher role... if, for example... Tony Blair had said: 'I want to help you,
George, on this, but I have to say, in all honesty, that I will not be able to
take part in any military operation unless we have palpable progress on the
[Middle East] peace process and we have absolute clarity on what happens in Iraq
if it comes up.' I think that would have changed the nature - it would not have
led to a rupture - it would have changed. the nature of American planning. "

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767482 Date: 07/31/2015
Even when defending UK policy, he was on the offensive. Asked if policy had been
adapted to stay in line with Washington's, Meyer added: "I wouldn't say it was
as extremely poodle-ish as that."
On Friday, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's former ambassador to the United
Nations, told Chilcot he had threatened to resign in 2002 if at least one
security council resolution was not passed. He added: "I regard our
participation in the military action in Iraq in March 2003 as legal but of
questionable legitimacy, in that it did not have the democratically observable
backing of the great majority of [UN] member states, or even perhaps of the
majority of people inside the UK."
Today new arguments are raging over whether the inquiry will have access to, and
publish, the most sensitive documents - including legal advice given to the
government by the former attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, during the lead-up to
war. Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader, has written to Gordon Brown saying
that, unless all such material is published, the inquiry will be a sham and the
public's sense that it has been denied the facts will remain.
But it will still be essential viewing nonetheless. This week will see more key
witnesses. The most revealing testimony could come tomorrow when Sir David
Manning, Blair's former foreign policy <hl:t37)://www.guardia. .uk/oo.Litics/ oreignpolioy>
adviser, is certain to be asked about his authorship of a memo which purportedly
revealed details of a secret meeting between Bush and Blair in January 2003.
According to reports, the five pages of secret documents, known as the Manning
memo, recorded the White House meeting on 31 January which allegedly shows that
Bush and Blair made a deal to carry out an invasion regardless of whether
weapons of mass destruction were discovered by UN weapons inspectors. It appears
to be in direct contradiction with statements that Blair made to parliament
afterwards that Saddam would be given a final chance to disarm.
The memo also disclosed that Bush floated the idea of painting a U-2 spyplane in
UN colours and letting it fly low over Iraq to provoke Saddam into ordering it
to be shot down, providing a pretext for the subsequent invasion by America and
Britain.

Manning, educated at Oriel College, Oxford, and a career diplomat, is fiercely
independent. He may choose to say more than Blair would like, according to one
former colleague. He could also be asked to either confirm or deny Meyer's
evidence that Meyer received "new instructions" in early 2005 indicating that it
was a "complete waste of time" to oppose regime change, so strong was the US
determination to go down that road.
On Tuesday, Edward Chaplin, the Foreign Office Middle East director at the time
of the invasion, and Sir Peter Ricketts, the top official in the Foreign Office,
will appear. Ricketts, a former chairman of Britain's powerful joint
intelligence committee, has already given evidence to the inquiry alleging that
officials in London knew even before Bush came to office in 2001 that there were
"voices" in Washington calling for Saddam to be removed from power. Ricketts
also told the inquiry that, until March 2002, Whitehall distanced itself from
regime change. Only one month later, Blair told Bush that he would support
military action "to bring about regime change".
According to documents leaked five years ago, Ricketts described the US in 2002
as "scrambling to establish a link between Iraq and al-Qaida" - a connection
that was "so far, frankly unconvincing". On Thursday, Sir Kevin Tebbit, the
Ministry of Defence's permanent secretary during the invasion, will be asked to
give evidence about the military planning. Chilcot will, most likely, want to
know when the government first began to amass resources for the war and what, if
any, preparations were made for the aftermath of an invasion. Tebbit could also
be urged to divulge the level of intelligence he received on the likelihood of
an attack with chemical or biological weapons.
After Tebbit, a succession of heavy-hitting military men will give evidence. The
former chief of the defence staff, Admiral the Lord Boyce, could be asked
whether he believes that the invasion was legal. On Friday, Lieutenant General
Sir Anthony Pigott, former deputy chief of the defence staff, and Major General
David Wilson, senior British military adviser to the US military's central
command between 2002 and 2003, will be questioned about military planning for
the conflict.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767482 Date: 07/31/2015
The last witness to appear this week will be Dominic Asquith, Britain's
ambassador to Iraq between 2006 and 2007, who will come armed with knowledge of
the view from Baghdad.
When Chilcot has made his way through the officials, he will turn in the new
year to former ministers, including Jack Straw, the former foreign secretary,
and Blair himself. The panel has said that it will also begin to examine the
highly controversial issue of whether the invasion was legal - which may turn
out to be the focal point of the whole inquiry - in January.
In his final report, which is not expected until late 2010 at the earliest,
Chilcot has said he will not seek to attribute blame. But after only one week it
is already clear where much of Whitehall believes that lies.

Afghanistan: The speech you'll miss
By Jim Hoagland
Sunday, November 29, 2009
Dec. 1, 2009:
My fellow Americans,
This is not the speech you expected to hear. But my wordsmiths are tied in knots
writing an acceptance speech for the only Nobel Peace Prize- ever awarded for
making speeches. So I am going to tell you how I really feel about Afghanistan.
Which is: steamed.
I want to accomplish three goals tonight without naming them.
First, to let those know-it-alls, Generals Petraeus and McChrystal, know one
more thing: This is the last big troop increase you get, so make it work.
I am not going down the incrementalist road that wrecked Lyndon Johnson's
presidency. This is not July 1965, when Westmoreland jumped the shark of
escalation in Vietnam and then never stopped asking for more troops. For all the
trouble he has been, Dick Holbrooke helped by recalling that history in the
shadowboxing that dominated my long war council meetings.
Joe Biden has been good in there, too. He's been willing, though not happy, to
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767482 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767482 Date: 07/31/2015
be characterized in the media as being ready to bug out now. This helped us push
back against McChrystal's effort to box me in at 40,000 additional U.S.
soldiers.
Denis McDonough, my strategic communications man, sold Biden-as-dove
brilliantly. Wasn't somebody just saying I should promote Denis? Maybe it was
Denis?
Never mind. That tactic won me room to maneuver toward a more realistic number
of, say, 23,000 new combat troops, 5,000 additional trainers and a "NATO surge"
of 5,000 foreign troops.
That's my second unspoken goal: to come out of this buildup speech Without
losing the left of the Democratic Party -- while being able to refute John
McCain's charges that I ignored my own generals. Triangulation lives.
Bush put the generals in the limelight to sell the Iraq surge after he lost all
credibility, and David Petraeus's performance was dazzling. Which presents two
big problems. Petraeus is the only person who could aet the Republican
nomination in 2012 and make a serious run against me. (I get paid to think
ahead.)
And if the generals box me in, civilian control. of the military in this country
becomes a mockery. Clinton was afraid of the military; Bush was deep in hock to
it. I've got to get the right balance back.
That's why I need Bob Gates and Jim Jones. Those who scoffed at my keeping on
Bush's defense secretary, and then making a retired Marine four-star I hardly
knew my NSC guy, were not thinking that moments like this would come. I already
was.
Gates has maneuvered flawlessly through my waterboarding-by-leaks on
Afghanistan. He will sell my final number to the uniforms as the "floor" for
U.S. troops that Petraeus argues we need for three years. But Gates knows I will
make it a ceiling.
We can't afford an open-ended commitment. I put Peter Orszag, as good a budget
overseer as you can find, front and center for the photographers in that last
war council. Many missed it, but NBC's Andrea Mitchell got it right away. No

wonder she's married to Alan Greenspan.
I will bet that Stan McChrystal never drew up a budget in his life.
Jones tells me these Special Operations commanders are used to getting whatever
they ask for, especially since September 11th. Nobody on the Hill will deny them
anything.
Jones is also squeezing the Europeans to join the battle and is getting results,
even from the Germans. What is it Jones says? Maybe the worst thing of all would
be to be perceived to lose in Afghanistan and then have the Europeans say: Well,
you never asked for more help at the crucial time. Makes sense to me.
We have sent NATO members the numbers we think they can and should provide,
country by country. That new secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, is
pulling out the stops, visiting the capitals to get commitments.
"Say it now, pay it later," we tell the Europeans. They have until mid-2010 to
deploy their new units. But I need pledges now so I can get across tonight that
this is NATO's war, not Obama's war. That's unspoken-goal number three.
So I have frontloaded the speech with allusions to this being about an exit
strategy, without boxing myself in on timing, and am presenting the "civilian
surge" as being as essential as the troop buildup. That helps set up my Oslo
speech. And who knows? It may even work out that way. If God blesses us all.

You should read this. This piece is prominently featured today in the Telegraph. It is a Tory paper. But it

Sarkozy's unleashed id is the barometer. You are still perceived as separate and even increasingly as
compensatory. The more coverage of your NI role, the better, if it can be done. (Let me discuss with Shaun on a
strategy on how to brief.) The China/Google stand was critical. What can be done in Middle East, esp Syria,
push back against Avigdor Lieberman's recent unpleasant noises, with new US ambo going? Just a thought.
And: the attitude that the president's cancellation of attendance at US-EU summit is simply a merited position is
self-defeating. First, the Europeans learned from the press, not through diplomatic channels beforehand, treated
as second class. Second, of course the EU is what it is, esp after the new nonentities named at its head at Merkel
and Sarko's behest. But to dismiss the EU because of that is smug and complacent. If the EU has no agenda, it's
really up to the US, as it was for 50 years before. It's up to the US to organize around a new agenda on the crisis
of global economy, including a common approach to China's mercantilism and climate change, etc, nuclear
proliferation, etc. Otherwise, petty trade wars will begin to dominate US-EU relations.

They swooned when the candidate took his stump skills to Berlin, where he spoke of "the burdens of global
citizenship" and promised to "remake the world".
He had lived in Indonesia as a boy, travelled to Pakistan and Africa in his youth and came from a family that
looked, as he liked to quip, "like the United Nations". Then, in his first year in office, he made 10 trips abroad to
21 countries, making him the most travelled of all United States presidents in their first 12 months.
So it came as a rude shock to Europeans last week when Obama decided not to bother with the European Union
knees up Madrid in May - particularly miffing Prime Minister Jose Luis Zapatero of Spain, who, like the
American president, campaigned on his opposition to the Iraq war.
American officials intimated that they were unimpressed by European bickering over who would sit next to the
Obamas at the summit dinner and even over who would be the first leader to shake the hand of the person that
Oprah Winfrey anointed as "the One" in Iowa back in 2008.
Perhaps Obama himself was a touch irritated by Nicolas Sarkozy's new habit of mocking him. "Obama has been
in power for a year, and he has already lost three special elections," the French president said last week. "Me, I
have won two legislative elections and the EU election. What can one say I've lost?"
The discomfort of Europe's elites indicates growing a realisation that perhaps he's just not that into them. The
fact that Hillary Clinton, Obama's Secretary of State, felt the need to point out that "European security remains
an anchor of US foreign and security policy" spoke volumes.
There is little sign that Obama feels the kind of instinctive belief in transatlantic alliances that, for instance,
President George W Bush felt. In Washington, the much-ballyhooed "special relationship" - a phrase that Team
Obama views as betraying a British inferiority complex and cloying neediness - has never felt less special.
That's partly because Gordon Brown is viewed as so toxic by the Obama administration that dealings with
Downing Street are in a state of virtual suspended animation. But there are no indications yet that a Prime
Minister David Cameron will have the red carpet rolled out for him.
One of Obama's conceits was that he would be the "Pacific president", looking west from his native Hawaii to
China, India and Japan rather than east to America's traditional allies. It's as if Obama has embraced Donald
Rumsfeld's much-maligned concept of "old Europe" - and broadened it.
The Czech Republic and Poland were told in late-night phone calls that planned missile defence sites on their
territory were being abandoned.
Mid-level American officials often produce plans and papers about Helmand that overlook the fact that British
troops have been fighting and dying there since 2006.
Obama's foreign policy sometimes seems like it does not go much further than the concept of"le monde, c'est
moi". The limits of his transcendental personality in terms of results are becoming as apparent abroad as they
are at home.
Relations with China sunk to a new low last week after the Obama decided to sell $6.4 billion in arms to
Taiwan and to meet the Dalai Lama. After kowtowing to China by avoiding discussion of human rights in a
humiliatingly ineffectual trip last November and failing to see the Tibetan monk, Obama's decided to get tough
- though to what end is unclear.
Having offered an "unclenched fist" to Iran, Obama has been almost casually rebuffed. As Sarkozy put it:
"What have these proposals for dialogue produced for the international community? Nothing but more enriched
uranium and more centrifuges."
In the Middle East, Obama's popularity is sliding among both Israelis and Arabs and the prospects of
meaningful peace talks are dire. Requests to Nato for more troops to train Afghan security forces have fallen
largely on deaf ears. Suddenly, the US no longer feels like the indispensable nation.
For all his talk of reaching out to the world and his apologies on behalf of America, there is little that Obama
has achieved. He is liked but not respected - and there are growing doubts about whether he has the backbone or
the domestic political capital to deliver.
Obama is finding that foreign policy is about more than just talk and turning up to take a bow. For its part, the
world is realising that the man it championed as one of its own is stumbling towards isolationism.

Obama's foreign policy sometimes seems like it does not go much further than the concept of "le
monde, c'est moi". The limits of his transcendental personality in terms of results are becoming
as apparent abroad as they are at home.
Relations with China sunk to a new low last week after the Obama decided to sell $6.4 billion in
arms to Taiwan and to meet the Dalai Lama. After kowtowing to China by avoiding discussion
of human rights in a humiliatingly ineffectual trip last November and failing to see the Tibetan
monk, Obama's decided to get tough - though to what end is unclear.
Having offered an "unclenched fist" to Iran, Obama has been almost casually rebuffed. As
Sarkozy put it: "What have these proposals for dialogue produced for the international
community? Nothing but more enriched uranium and more centrifuges."
In the Middle East, Obama's popularity is sliding among both Israelis and Arabs and the
prospects of meaningful peace talks are dire. Requests to Nato for more troops to train Afghan
security forces have fallen largely on deaf ears. Suddenly, the US no longer feels like the
indispensable nation.
For all his talk of reaching out to the world and his apologies on behalf of America, there is little
that Obama has achieved. He is liked but not respected - and there are growing doubts about
whether he has the backbone or the domestic political capital to deliver.
Obama is finding that foreign policy is about more than just talk and turning up to take a bow.
For its part, the world is realising that the man it championed as one of its own is stumbling
towards isolationism.

Shaun regrets he cannot come here tomorrow. Here's the problem and the plan:
Cameron is still quietly giving encouragement to the Ulster Unionists, which,
led by Reg Empey, are trying to scuttle the agreement somehow. So the plan is
for Shaunn to announce he will deliver a speech on Monday in the House of
Commons presenting the agreement—except that at the last second Gordon will step
in on the floor for Shaun, requiring Cameron to respond, theoretically forcing
him to support the agreement. In his speech, Gordon will explicitly cite your
role and support of the US—among other things further cornering Cameron (and
Empey). Shaun would like to speak with you soon depending on how things are
working out there, perhaps tomorrow (Sunday) or perhaps Monday (perhaps after
Commons). Dinner will be on a rain-check.

January 9,2010
The First Lady, her young lover, and a scandal
that could hand power to Sinn Fein
David McKittrick reports on the far-reaching consequences of
Iris Robinson's infidelity
The mesmerising saga of the toyboy, the Northern Ireland First Minister and his straying wife threatened to engulf
Belfast's frail political settlement last night.
Following a day closeted with advisers Peter Robinson, head of the Northern Ireland government, broke his silence to
insist defiantly that he would not step down after a day of turmoil. His move is unlikely to stem the clamour for an inquiry
into an affair which has fused the political and the sexual. First indications are that members of his party, the Democratic
Unionists (DUP), are reacting to the disclosures with strong disapproval. The party is highly religious and lays heavy
emphasis on Christian family values. It is also currently highly nervous that the revelations could cost it seats in the
coming Westminster election. If the DUP were to fracture as a result of the scandal it could lead the way to Sinn Fein
becoming the largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly - allowing it to nominate its own first minister and putting the
peace process in jeopardy.
Disclosures in a BBC television programme on the activities of his wife, Iris, who has exited from public life, led to a day-
long flurry of political calls for inquiries into the Robinson family.
Mr Robinson stands accused of failing to notify the authorities that his wife had been involved in financial transactions
without declaring an interest. She helped a 19-year-old "toyboy" lover to set up a business.
Mr Robinson said he had asked for the appointment of a senior counsel "to ask me any questions he or she wishes to
ask, and to give an opinion as to what I should have disclosed or whether I have breached an obligation".
Insisting he had done nothing wrong, Mr Robinson accused the BBC of broadcasting "smears and innuendo". Saying that
he did not rule out a defamation action, he declared: "I am being tried in the court of public opinion."
Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness, who is Deputy First Minister, said he was shocked at the BBC revelations and is seeking
talks with both Mr Robinson and Gordon Brown. Mr McGuinness was publicly sympathetic when news of the scandal
broke, but his veering towards a tougher line is taken as indicating a calculation that Mr Robinson may not survive the
storm.
Mr Robinson, who has been First Minister for 18 months, is regarded as a pivotal figure in the peace process since he
was prepared to follow the Rev Ian Paisley into government with Sinn Fein.
But the state of the political settlement has appeared increasingly rocky as Mr Robinson has resisted pressure from
almost all points of the political compass to complete devolution by accepting a transfer of responsibility for policing from
London to Belfast.
His reluctance to move on the policing issue was attributed to nervousness about challenges from hardline opponents in
the Westminster general election. Now opponents are speculating that it might instead have at least partly been due to the
family scandal which has just become public but which he knew of for months.
In recent days Mrs Robinson dramatically announced that she was leaving politics. She is currently Westminster MP for
east Belfast, a councillor and a member of the Belfast Assembly. Yesterday there were calls for her to depart immediately
and stop drawing her salaries.
These reflected the fact that, while her husband might have a faint chance of political survival, her behaviour is regarded
as inexcusable.

She had been a friend of Kirk McCambley's father, Billy. Before he died, he asked Mrs Robinson to look after his son. The
BBC programme, Spotlight, revealed that her relationship with Kirk had developed into a sexual one. It said she
suggested to him that he go into a business venture which was partly organised by Castlereagh council, where she is an
alderman.
She is said to have obtained £50,000 from two property developers, to be used to set up the business. She is also said to
have helped approve the McCambley proposal without declaring a financial interest. The council said yesterday it was
investigating.
The young man was interviewed for the programme. So too was Mrs Robinson's one-time political adviser Selwyn Black,
a former Methodist minister, who gave the BBC access to 150 text messages allegedly sent to him by Mrs Robinson.
Among those calling for a public inquiry yesterday were Jim Allister of Traditional Unionist Voice, a hardline critic of Mr
Robinson. He said the issues in the programme must be addressed "with utter transparency and candour".
Ulster Unionist leader Sir Reg Empey called for Mrs Robinson's immediate resignation, saying: "It is clear that Iris
Robinson's continuing position as an MP, Assembly member and councillor is utterly untenable. She should resign all her
positions with immediate effect."
He added: "It is also unfortunately the case that the office of the First Minister is embroiled in these matters. My party will
study the events outlined by the BBC and the very serious allegations that have been made with regards to the conduct of
the First Minister. Inevitably the appropriate authorities will be required to investigate the allegations made against the
First Minister."
* Northern Ireland Secretary Shaun Woodward refused to speculate about Mr Robinson's future.
But he said: "It is a responsibility on everyone in the Assembly to understand that the consequences of allowing the
political process to slide would undoubtedly have an impact on the broader canvas.
"And that if anybody were to be selfish enough to think this is a moment when that can be allowed to be put in the deep
freeze, even some may wish to unpick, they would be extremely irresponsible, foolish and would be playing very, very
dangerous games."
Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Woodward said that the First Minister had to be allowed the opportunity
to clear his name.
But he went on: "I'm very conscious of the fact that while all that is happening, he is First Minister and the business of
devolution, the business of the Executive must go on.
"I hope he will be able to resume the responsibilities as First Minister to ensure that the work of the Executive continues
and that includes the talks on policing and justice devolution." PA

Fear of the poor is hampering Haiti rescue
American views rule among the rubble of Port-au-Prince.
That's one reason aid is taking so long to get to those in need
Linda Polman
Aid workers have already baptised the earthquake in Haiti a "historical disaster". It will rate high in the annals of the
humanitarian aid world because of the number of victims and scale of the destruction. But the rescue operation is also
becoming notorious for the slowness with which aid is reaching the victims. Five days after the quake hit, many places are
still largely bereft of international aid.
Not through lack of funds, supplies or emergency experts. Those are all pouring in from dozens of countries. But most of
the aid — and aid workers — seems stuck at the airport.
Rescue teams have pulled survivors from five-star hotels, university buildings, a supermarket and the UN headquarters,
all in Port-au-Prince's better neighbourhoods. In poor areas, where the damage appears much greater, apparently
forgotten victims report on Twitter that they have yet to encounter the first foreign rescuer.
Many aid workers are reported to have orders not to venture out without armed guards — which are not there at all, or
only after long debates with the UN military command. The UN has lost a number of staff in the quake, and is not keen to
risk more lives.
But the Haitian people seem to scare aid workers more than Somali warlords, Darfuri Janjawid or Afghan Taleban.
Frightened Dutch aid workers abandoned a mission without•reaching the collapsed building where people were trapped,
and frightened doctors have left their patients unattended.
The experience of CNN's medical reporter, Dr Sanjay Gupta, is telling. In a makeshift clinic he encountered a Belgian
medical team being evacuated in a UN bus. UN "rules of engagement" apparently stopped them providing security for the
doctors. The Belgians took most of their medical supplies with them, to keep them out of the claws of robbers.
Dr Gupta and his camera team stayed the night, monitored the abandoned patients' vital signs and continued intravenous
drips — and they were not robbed. Some rescuers are leaning so much toward security that they will allow people to die.
The media are not helping. CNN rules in the rubble. "Outside of a military conflict, this is our biggest international
deployment since the tsunami in 2004," according to Tony Maddox, the managing director of CNN International. So the
image of the aid operation being beamed back is primarily Ameridan — and one of the big problems is the American view
of Haiti.
CNN won't stop telling aid workers and the outside world about pillaging (the incidence of which — for the first four
frustrating days at least — did not compare with what happened after Hurricane Katrina) and about how dangerous it is to
distribute food, because of the likelihood of "stampedes".
Nor is the US Government, the biggest player in the aid operation, doing anything to help to relax the atmosphere. On the
contrary. When President Obama said that the US aid effort would be "aggressive" he meant it. The humanitarian
operation is not led by civilian agencies, but by the Pentagon.
Mr Obama ordered 9,000 troops and a fleet of nuclear-powered ships to move in. Victims of the war in Congo (which has
cost five million lives in the past years) and of the genocide in Darfur would love so much American attention — but it is
Haiti's fate to lay in America's backyard and to have been a sore to American eyes for decades already.
One, perhaps even two million Haitians already live in the United States, but more try to come. Every day dead Haitian
refugees wash up on Miami's sunny beaches. Haiti is a constant pain for US taxpayers who feel that the billions of dollars

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767623 Date: 08/31/2015
that have been poured in should have at least lifted the country out of its position as one of the poorest places on Earth.
Even when the earthquake struck, investigations were taking place into the fate of several million dollars of aid funds, sent
to victims of a hurricane that hit Haiti in 2008, that have disappeared.
Furthermore, to the horror of many godfearing Americans, voodoo is an officially recognised religion in Haiti. And, perhaps
above all, Haitians are poor and black. In the view of some Americans those two add up to ... murderous gangs.
The invasion of soldiers and humanitarian workers at the airport of Port-au-Prince reminds me of the American military
invasion of Haiti authorised by President Clinton in 1994. I'd lived and worked there for almost two years as a
correspondent for Dutch radio. There were 20,000 soldiers but they were surprisingly nervous about what reception the
unarmed Haitians might have in store for them.
It turned out to be a wave of slum dwellers streaming to the air and sea port to greet the American guests. In abundant
conga lines they snaked through the city, tea cosies on their heads to express just how happy they were. "Liberte! Merci
Beel Cling Dong!" they shouted. A terrified American GI, still a teenager, saw the mass of pitiful creatures approaching
him, and asked me if the tea cosies were "some kinda voodoo?". He calmed down only when a line of BMWs and
Mitsubishis appeared and filed past to watch the invasion.
Where the soldier came from, the owners of vehicles like these are respectable citizens. In Haiti, they are likely to be the
ones smuggling drugs and making US aid dollars disappear. The good guys in Haiti are the defenceless people in the
slums. For Western city dwellers, this is the world turned upside down. "Back! Back!" the soldier shouted, aiming his
weapons at the good guys.
The rescue teams that stay put at the airport are one reason why we still don't really know what is going on. Seventy
survivors had been pulled from the rubble so far, the International Red Cross said on Sunday. That's 14 rescues per day
as a joint result of the 1,739 international specialised rescue workers that are there. That number would surely jump if
some of the professional equipment that they brought was made available to the countless groups of local people
desperately digging for victims with their bare hands, day and night.
Let's hope that the food distributors worrying about their safety know that yesterday hundreds of people in Port-au-Prince
dropped to their knees praying outside a warehouse where workers for the agency Food for the Poor had announced that
they would be distributing rice and beans. The crowd allowed children and the elderly to go first in line without having
guns aimed at them first.

fyi: Blair's chances seem to be cratering in EU. Sid
Tony lair's bid for EU residency sinks
Ex-PM's chances of winning role slide as Sarkozy and Merkel fail to back him
• Nicholas s‘tv'at.i. and )an,..Trajf.pf in Brussels
• u!,-„ Thursday 29 October 2009 21.26 GMT
T20.,.:31::.3.1:7's hopes of becoming Europe's first sitting president were receding fast tonight as Britain admitted his chances
of success were "fading" after the continent's centre-right leaders made it clear one of their own must have the post.
Hours after G
.nr.4,
,efl Srov.,,h delivered his strongest statement of support for Blair — disclosing that he had spoken to him
earl;er this week — British sources indicated that the former prime minister was unlikely to assume the high-profile. job.
"it would be right to describe Tony's c,hances as fading," one British source said."..slcgles. t.
..aa'r.sa; and are
not terribly enthusiastic. Silvio Berlust.-,oni remains his strongest backer."
Bialr's expected failure to secure the post of president of the European Council meant that ca,•,-,'et.,
.."it;ity.n-te was emerging
as a serious contender to assume the new post of high representative for foreign policy. The foreign secretary insisted,
however, that.he was "not available".
Miliband spoke out as British sources said it had become clear in recent days that Blair would struggle to become
president. The post is likely to be filled in the next month amid signs that the Czech Republic will become the last EU
country to ratify the Lisbon treaty.
Sarkozy, the French president, and Merkel, the German chancellor, are understood to have agreed at a dinner at the
Elysee Palace last night that the new president should be appointed from the main centre-right EPP grouping, which
brings together the parties currently ruling most EU countries.
Brown gave a hint at a press conference that Blair's candidacy was fading when he qualified his strong backing for his
predecessor by stating that there were also other candidates for the job. "Of course it may not happen and there are other
candidates as well," he said.
The prime minister's remarks came after he attended an acrimonious meeting of the European centre-left leaders this
afternoon, shortly before the EU summit in Brussels began.
Brown was understood to have had a tense exchange with Martin Schulz, the German leader of the Socialists in the
European parliament, who wants the left to assume the new foreign policy post, leaving the presidency to the centre right.
Brown told the meeting: "You need to get real. This is a unique opportunity to get a progressive politician to be the
president of the council."
But it soon became clear that Blair has no support on the left, let alone on the centre right. Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero,
Spain's centre-left prime minister, for the first time publicly queried the Blair candidacy by announcing that the centre left
across the EU was more concerned with securing the other post of European foreign minister. Zapatero, who will have to
work with the new European figureheads when Spain assumes the Eti's six-month rotating presidency on 1 January, said
the European socialists were clear that they want the post of the high representative. "There is a preference for the high
representative," he said. "That is rather reasonable."
A senior Spanish official said this was the first time that Zapatero had "dropped Blair" and that the centre-left in the EU
was seeking a deal with the centre-right, led by Merkel. The centre-right would get the job coveted by Blair, while the
centre left would take the foreign minister post. The lack of support for Blair became clear when Jean Asselborn,
Luxembourg's foreign minister, launched a strong attack on him as be emerged from the meeting of Socialist leaders. "lt is
not about the person of Tony Blair. Now in the United States, Obama is the president, it is no more Mr Bush. We have a
new treaty, we have to reset Europe and we need to start with some new ideas. There is and will remain a link for the next
generation between Iraq, Bush and Tony Blair."

Downing Street wiil resist criticism that it was wrong to mount such a strong campaign in favour of Blair when it had
become clear earlier this week that his chances were fading.
Brown believes it was right — and in the national interest — to argue strongly for Blair when there was a chance to secure
such a senior post for Britain. Blair, who had a tense relationship with Brown during his decade as prime minister, will be
pleased by the strength of his successor's support.
Brown said today: "Let me say very clear that we, the British government, believe that Tony Blair would be an excellent
candidate and an excellent person to hold the job of president of the council.
"His international experience is well known, his expertise on environmental, economic and security issues is well known to
everybody throughout Europe as well as known throughout the world If you have the chance for that to happen it is in
Britain's national interest."

Re: Cameron Blowup in Europe .
Without: passing "Go," David Cameron has seriously damaged his relations with the European leaders. Sending
a letter to Czech leader Vaclav Klaus encouraging him not to sign the Lisbon Treaty, as though Cameron were
already Prime Minister, he has offended Sarkozy, Merkel and Zapatero. Within the Conservative Party the
Shadow Foreign Minister William Hague has arduously pressured for an anti-EU stance, despite his assurances
to you that Tory policy toward Europe would be marked by continuity. Cameron has attempted to straddle
factions, fending off calls for a national referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. But this letter is proof positive of his
tilt to the Tory right on Europe. The European leaders understand that the letter signals his future policy and are
reacting accordingly. Cameron's presumptive strike has accelerated the predicted Tory-European split from
post-election to pre-election. Whether this affects Merkel's attitude on Blair and the EU presidency remains
unclear, but Cameron's high-handed behavior is precisely the sort of thing that provokes her. See the Guardian
report below:

Europe leaders incensed by David Cameron's letter
Sarkozy, Merkel and Zapatero criticise Tories for attempt to-delay treaty
Niche: Watt and 1 anTi-aynor
Friday 30 October 2009 22.21 GMT
Leaders of three of the most powerful countries in Europe have strongly criticised David Cameron at the EU
summit over Conservative plans to scupper the Lisbon treaty.
Nicolas Sarkozy, Angela Merkel and Jose Luiz Rodriguez Zapatero are understood to have privately criticised
the Tory leader after he sent a handwritten letter to the Czech president Vaclav Klaus, who is refusing to sign
the treaty. The letter was seen as an attempt to influence the Czech Republic, the only country not to have
ratified the treaty.

Senior British sources familiar with thinking at the highest levels of the EU say that the leaders of France,
Germany and 5-_,ain all raised questions about the Cameron letter.
It is understood that Cameron encouraged Klaus to delay the ratification of the treaty by setting out Tory policy
to hold a referendum in Britain on the treaty if it has not been ratified by all member states.
The sources have told the Guardian that:
•Sarkozy was overheard telling Gordon Brown that he was incensed by Cameron's letter, which the French saw
as an attempt to wreck the Lisbon treaty.
•Merkel was also said to be upset by Cameron's letter. The German chancellor is understood to have echoed.
concerns of senior figures in her CDU party, such as the former European parliament president Hans Gert
Poettering, that Cameron's behaviour had been untrustworthy.
•Zapatero - who addressed the recent Labour party conference and will have to negotiate directly with
Cameron if he wins the election because Spain holds the EU's rotating presidency until July 2010 - made clear

group consisting mainly of fringe parties from the hard right in eastern Europe, the prime minister said: "The

standing on the fringes of Europe. That is a huge mistake for British interests."

Re: Cameron Blowup in Europe
Without passing "Go," David Cameron has seriously damaged his relations with the European
leaders. Sending a letter to Czech leader Vaclav Klaus encouraging him not to sign the Lisbon
Treaty, as though Cameron were already Prime Minister, he has offended Sarkozy, Merkel and
Zapatero. Within the Conservative Party the Shadow Foreign Minister William Hague has
arduously pressured for an anti-EU stance, despite his assurances to you that Tory policy toward
Europe would be marked by continuity. Cameron has attempted to straddle factions, fending off
calls for a national referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. But this letter is proof positive of his tilt to
the Tory right on Europe. The European leaders understand that the letter signals his future .
policy and are reacting accordingly. Cameron's presumptive strike has accelerated the predicted
Tory-European split from post-election to pre-election. Whether this affects Merkel's attitude on
Blair and the EU presidency remains unclear, but Cameron's high-handed behavior is precisely
the sort of thing that provokes her. See the Guardian report below:
Guardian
Europe leaders incensed by David Cameron's
letter
Sarkozy, Merkel and Zapatero criticise Tories for attempt to delay treaty
Nicholas Watt and Ian Traynor
guardian.co.uk, Friday 30 October 2009 22.21 GMT
Leaders of three of the most powerful countries in Europe have strongly criticised David
Cameron at the EU summit over Conservative plans to scupper the Lisbon treaty.
Nicolas Sarkozy, Angela Merkel and Jose Luiz Rodriguez Zapatero are understood to have
privately criticised the Tory leader after he sent a handwritten letter to the Czech president
Vaclav Klaus, who is refusing to sign the treaty. The letter was seen as an attempt to influence
the Czech Republic, the only country not to have ratified the treaty.
Senior British sources familiar with thinking at the highest levels of the EU say that the leaders
of France, Germany and Spain all raised questions about the Cameron letter.

It is understood that Cameron encouraged Klaus to delay the ratification of the treaty by setting
out Tory policy to hold a referendum in Britain on the treaty if it has not been ratified by all
member states.
The sources have told the Guardian that:
•Sarkozy was overheard telling Gordon Brown that he was incensed by Cameron's letter, which
the French saw as an attempt to wreck the Lisbon treaty.
•Merkel was also said to be upset by Cameron's letter. The German chancellor is understood to
have echoed concerns of senior figures in her CDU party, such as the former European
parliament president Hans Gert Poettering, that Cameron's behaviour had been untrustworthy.
• Zapatero — who addressed the recent Labour party conference and will have to negotiate
directly with Cameron if he wins the election because Spain holds the EU's rotating presidency
until July 2010 — made clear to diplomats that he regarded Cameron's letter as damaging and an
attempt to scupper the treaty.
The interventions by the EU leaders come as the Tories plan to abandon their two-year campaign
to hold a referendum on the Lisbon treaty. Senior Tories told the Guardian that Cameron will set
out his thinking in the coming weeks if, as expected, the Czech president finally ratifies the
treaty.

Gordon Brown on course to win election
David Smith and Jonathan Oliver
GORDON BROWN is on course to remain prime minister after the general election as a new Sunday Times poll reveals
that Labour is now just two points behind the Tories.
The YouGov survey places David Cameron's Conservatives on 37%, as against 35% for Labour — the closest gap
between the parties in more than two years.
It means Labour is heading for a total of 317 seats, nine short of an overall majority, with the Tories languishing on a total
of just 263 MPs. Such an outcome would mean Brown could stay in office and deny Cameron the keys to No 10.
The poll result presents the Conservative leader with one of the greatest challenges of his leadership today as he makes
the keynote speech to his party's spring forum.
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Cameron defied his right-wing critics who believe the party's modernisation has
gone too far. He said: "Some people say to me, 'Play things safe; try to win by default — the government is in a mess.' I
say, 'No. This is the Conservative party that is offering radical change. I'm doubling up on change'."
With the expected May 6 election now just over two months away, Cameron will seek to reconnect with voters through a
series of pledges, including a plan to restore discipline in schools. In an echo of the speech that won him the Tory
leadership in 2005, he will address the Brighton conference without notes.
"This is very, very clear," he said. "I've made my choice. There is no going back. This election is about change and we will
be offering change."
Cameron insisted he was unconcerned about the collapse in Tory support. "The polls move around a lot," he said. "The
voters tell us that they want change. They want to know the Conservative party itself has changed."
The narrowing of the Conservative lead has been dramatic and rapid. Until January the Tories held close to a 10-point
lead. But a week ago a Sunday Times YouGov poll put the gap at six points, suggesting a hung parliament, with the
Tories still on course to become the largest party.
In the last election, in 2005, support for the parties generally held steady in the run-up to polling day. YouGov polling for
The Sunday Times showed Labour leads of between two and five points from January through to the June election.
Labour's margin of victory was three points.
In today's poll, Labour has risen two points on the previous week, from 33%, while the Conservatives have dropped two
from 39%. The Liberal Democrats are unchanged on 17%.
The collapse in the Tory poll lead will put pressure on the pound in financial markets tomorrow by adding to fears that a
hung parliament will mean insufficient action is taken to cut Britain's budget deficit.
The last time the gap between the two main parties came this close and the Tory support was so low was in autumn 2007.
That was before Brown's honeymoon ended with his failure to call a snap general election. The Conservatives went on to
peak in May 2008 with a 26-point lead.
Today's poll suggests recent claims about Brown's tantrums and his intimidation of staff may have actually helped him.
Just 28% of people believe the prime minister is a bully and 50% agree he has a "strong sense of right and wrong".
The survey disclosed growing concerns about Cameron's elite background and lack of empathy with ordinary families.
Just 25% think that Cameron understands problems faced by "people like me", compared with 35% for Brown.

Furthermore, only 28% think the Conservative leader wants to do the best for "all groups in Britain", against 39% for the
prime minister.
Peter Kellner, president of YouGov, the Sunday Times pollster, said that while individual polls could throw up unexpected
shifts, the recent trend had been for a significant narrowing of the Tory lead.
"Our daily polls should be regarded a bit like the FTSE index: a 100-point rise or fall in a day might be a blip or a trend —
often we can't tell for a few days," he said.
"I am confident the Tory lead is down this weekend but I can't promise whether the latest movement will be sustained,
increased or reversed in the days ahead. One of the reasons for doing daily polls is to monitor these fluctuations."
The Tory lead of 6%, which was first reported in The Sunday Times, was maintained in YouGov's polls in The Sun last
week. The increase in support for Labour on Thursday and Friday, as the latest Sunday Times poll was being conducted,
came as figures showed a strengthening economic recovery.
Under the British parliamentary system, the prime minister remains in office after a general election until he either tenders
his resignation or is defeated in a Commons no confidence vote.
If the election result leaves Labour just short of an overall majority, Brown is likely to battle on, with Labour running the
country as a minority government. The party would seek to do deals with minor parties such as Ulster's Democratic
Unionist party or, if necessary, Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats, to get its legislation through parliament.
If repeated in a general election on the basis of a uniform swing in all constituencies, today's poll would leave Labour just
nine seats short of the 326 needed for an overall majority in the new 650-seat House of Commons.
The Tories would be well behind on 263 seats, with the Liberal Democrats on 41. Kellner calculated that, even allowing for
a larger swing to the Tories in marginal seats, where the party has spent millions of pounds on campaigning, the poll was
consistent with Labour being by far the largest party.
He suggested that in such a scenario Labour might win 300 seats, with the Tories on 270 and the Lib Dems on 50.
Labour will believe it is benefiting from the upturn in the economy. For the first time in a YouGov poll since July 2007,
before the financial crisis, people trust Labour more than the Tories to run the economy.
YouGov, which began polling after the 2001 election, has developed a reputation for accuracy. Its final Sunday Times poll
in 2005 was precisely right, and it accurately predicted Boris Johnson's victory in the 2008 London mayoral election and
the results of last year's Euro elections.

Senate Race Competitive
Raleigh, N.C. — The race to replace Ted Kennedy in the US Senate is looking like a toss
up, with Republican Scott Brown up 48-47 on Martha Coakley.
Brown is benefiting from depressed Democratic interest in the election and a huge lead
among independents for his surprisingly strong standing. Those planning to vote in the
special election only report having voted for Barack Obama in 2008 by a 16 point
margin, in contrast to his actual 26 point victory in the state.
That decline in turnout from Obama voters plagued Democratic candidates for Governor
in Virginia and New Jersey last fall. Beyond that 66% of Republicans say they're 'very
excited' about turning out while only 48% of Democrats express that sentiment.
Brown leads 63-31 with independents and is winning 17% of the Democratic vote while
Coakley receives only 6% support from GOP voters. Both candidates are relatively
popular, with 57% viewing Brown favorably to only 25% unfavorable and 50% with a
positive opinion of Coakley to 42% negative.
Those folks planning to vote in the special election are actually opposed to Obama's
health care plan by a 47/41 margin and only narrowly express approval of the President's
overall job performance 44/43.
"The Massachusetts Senate race is shaping up as a potential disaster for Democrats," said
Dean Debnam, President of Public Policy Polling. "Martha Coakley's complacent
campaign has put Scott Brown in a surprisingly strong position and she will need to step
it up in the final week to win a victory once thought inevitable."
PPP surveyed 744 likely Massachusetts voters from January 7th to 9th. The margin of
error is +/-3.6%. Other factors, such as refusal to be interviewed and weighting, may
introduce additional error that is more difficult to quantify.

Re: Northern Ireland crisis and latest UK coup
The political crisis in Northern Ireland is fast moving and fluid. On Friday, January 7, after reading a lengthy
statement on TV denouncing his wife repeatedly for her affair (with a teenager), Peter Robinson assured Shaun
Woodward privately that no financial irregularity was involved. Then, within hours, it was reported that Iris
Robinson secured 50,000 pounds from government contractors to give to her lover to set up a restaurant. Peter
Robinson in fact knew of the money all along. Robinson had an opportunity to save himself, perhaps, by
declaring himself for engagement on devolution, freeing himself of the DUP hardliners and throwing himself on
public opinion, but was incapable of acting. By accepting his withdrawal as First Minister for six weeks today,
the DUP has maintained a modicum of Robinson's authority, though it is in suspended animation. His
temporary replacement, Arlene Foster, according to Shaun, comes from the modernizing wing of the party.
Shaun does not know if her naming indicates a potetinally positive direction or makes her a prisoner of those
who put her in place. The silence of Sinn Fein is telling. Not reacting in horror, Sinn Fein is unsure whether this
is good or bad news, and it's willing to wait. But the waiting game is untenable without forward movement on
devolution.
Here's why: Without positive steps from Foster and the DUP, the situation will become swiftly unacceptable to
Sinn Fein. It will speak out. Martin McGuinness will have to express his opposition to DUP recalcitrance and
paralysis. Earlier, Shaun sent signals to leaders of the DUP that Robinson's resignation would provoke a series
of events leading rapidly to Shaun calling an election in which they would be tainted by him and suffer a
catastrophic defeat, followed by the general UK election (almost certainly May 6) that would compound their
misery. Shaun was trying to push them not to scuttle the peace process but to embrace it and move forward.
Robinson's six weeks hiatus puts the DUP in a fugue state, a twilight zone of disorientation, that cannot be
sustained even this week. Shaun is also working through the Irish government to communicate to Adams not to
provoke a full-blown crisis, ruining peace prospects in order to advance the dream of a united Ireland.

There's more to come, hour by hour, but the situation remains extremely murky. It should clairfy within days.
On the latest coup attempt against Gordon: The plotters, Patricia Hewitt and Geoffrey Hoon, had no one behind
them. It was a fizzle. This is the third and likely the last attempt. It's the end of the coup season. Ironically, the
coup was announced just as Gordon had had his best week, last week, after David Cameron flip-flopped on a
marriage tax and Gordon walloped him in Question Time. The coup obviously halted that momentum and
shifted the subject to disunity within the Labour Party. Gordon and Labour lost a bit of time and ground it will
have to make up. But various polls show almost no negative movement of Gordon in a matchup with Cameron.
He has pulled to within ten points and remains steady. However, a poll in the Guardian today shows that while
Gordon has actually improved his standing within the party the party itslef has taken a hit.
David Miliband was the loser in this coup attempt. He took seven hours before responding, issuing a tepid
statement saying he expected that labour would win under Gordon's leadership. His vacillation marked him.
Niether willing to strike nor support, he seems unsure, wobbly. His performance has made people wonder if
he's the man to be leader after Gordon. David's brother, Ed, the environment minister, meanwhile, reacting
swiftly in his backing of Gordon, and has emerged as a sterling fellow. Mandelson, for his part, waited to go on
TV to express his public support. No one trusts him, yet he's indispensable. If somehow Gordon wins, he would
likely be the first one defenestrated. More to come soon...

Obama's Approval Rating Dips to New Low
(CBS)
President Obama's job approval rating has fallen to 46 percent, according to a new CBS News poll.
That rating is Mr. Obama's lowest yet in CBS News polling, and the poll marks the first time his approval rating has fallen
below the 50 percent mark. Forty-one percent now say they disapprove of Mr. Obama's performance as president.
In last month's CBS News poll, 50 percent of Americans approved of how the president was handling his job, while thirty-
nine percent disapproved.
Analysis: The Irony Behind Obama's Poll Numbers
Mr. Obama still receives strong support from Democrats (eight in ten approve of his performance), but his approval rating
among Republicans is only 13 percent. More importantly, Mr. Obama's approval rating among independents has declined
10 points in recent months — and it now stands at just 42 percent.
Domestic issues — and not his response to terrorist threats - appear to be driving the president's approval rating
downward.
Just 41 percent now approve of his handling of the economy, which Americans say is the nation's most pressing issue.
Forty-seven percent disapprove. The president's marks on handling health care, with reforms still under debate in
Congress, are even lower — just 36 percent approve, while 54 percent disapprove. Both of these approval ratings are the
lowest of Mr. Obama's presidency.
Meanwhile, both parties in Congress receive even lower marks than the president on handling health care. Few
Americans think the reforms in Congress hit the right note on expanding coverage, lowering costs and regulating the
health insurance industry. (Read more on the health care poll results)
(CBS)
The president receives slightly higher ratings for his handling of the war in Afghanistan and the threat of terrorism than on
domestic issues. Forty-six percent approve of Mr. Obama's handling of Afghanistan, and 52 percent approve of how he is
handling the threat of terrorism.
While some Republicans have criticized the president and Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano's responses
to the attempted Christmas Day terror attack, most Americans don't share their opinion.
In the poll, 57 percent of Americans approve of the way the Obama administration has responded to the attempted attack,
and 29 percent disapprove. Views are highly partisan — 75 percent of Democrats approve, while just 41 percent of
Republicans and 55 percent of independents do.

•Fear of another terrorist attack has increased since the attempted attack on a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam
on Christmas Day. Now, 26 percent think another attack on the United States within the next few months is very likely, up
from 12 percent just before the latest incident. This is the highest percentage that has felt an attack was very likely since
March 2003, just after the U.S. invasion of Iraq.
•While most Americans (56 percent) have at least a fair amount of confidence that the government will protect its citizens
from future attacks, just 15 percent are very confident. In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, more expressed confidence.
•Few Americans —just 19 percent - think U.S. intelligence agencies are doing all they could to monitor the actions of
suspected terrorists. Seventy-six think they could be doing more.
•Most Americans support conducting full body scans on travelers using a digital x-ray machine, a device some airports
are now using. Seventy-four percent agree these machines should be used because they provide a detailed check for
hidden weapons and explosives and reduce the need for physical searches. Just 20 percent think these machines should
not be used because they would produce an image of a passenger's naked body and are an invasion of privacy.
•Over half of Americans think the U.S. should continue to keep the Guantanamo Bay prison open. Thirty-two percent
think it ought to be closed and the prisoners there transferred somewhere else.
•The American public continues to volunteer the economy and jobs as the most important problem facing the country (44
percent), with health care a distant second (14 percent). In the wake of the attempted terror attack on Christmas Day, the
percentage that cites terrorism as the most pressing issue has risen to seven percent from zero percent early last month.
•The public's overall assessment of the condition of the national economy remains grim — 82 percent of Americans say
the economy is in bad shape. Looking ahead, 31 percent of Americans think the economy is getting better, while 19
percent think it is getting worse. Forty-nine percent now say the economy is staying the same.

New blow for Tories as lead slips in marginals
By Nigel Morris and Michael Savage
Poll shows crumbling support in target seats as David
Cameron is drawn into Ashcroft non-dom row
The Conservative lead is crumbling in the crucial marginal seats that David Cameron is relying on to deliver general
election victory for the party, a poll last night disclosed.
The result was a fresh setback for the Tory leader after a torrid day in which he was drawn deeper into the row over the
billionaire peer Lord Ashcroft, when it emerged that he had known for less than a month that Lord Ashcroft had
maintained his non-dom tax status for 10 years.
The chances of the party drawing a line under the controversy were also wrecked by the announcement that Lord
Ashcroft will be summoned to the Commons to explain why he negotiated a secret deal to enter the House of Lords
without paying tax in this country on his overseas fortune.
With Gordon Brown expected to announce the election date this month, senior Tories have put a brave face on their
sliding support in national opinion polls since the turn of the year.
They insisted they were performing much more strongly in marginal constituencies where the drive for votes has been
masterminded and substantially funded by Lord Ashcroft.
The YouGov poll for Channel 4 News found the Tory lead in 60 Labour-held marginals had shrunk from seven to just two
points over the past year.
The slide in Conservative support is further evidence Britain could be heading for a hung parliament after the election
expected on 6 May. The survey put the Tories on 39 per cent (down four points since last year) and Labour on 37 per cent
(up one). YouGov calculated that the results would leave the Tories the largest party after the election, but 11 seats short
of an overall Commons majority.
An investigation by The Independent last week found the Tories spent £6m over two years in the marginal battlegrounds,
in most cases far outspending Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
The party faces the daunting challenge of capturing 117 seats to achieve a majority of just one - a task described by a
shadow cabinet member as a "mountain to climb".
The Conservatives received some good news yesterday when an 18-month inquiry by the Electoral Commission
concluded that the £5.1m they received in donations from Bearwood Corporate Services, controlled by Lord Ashcroft,
were legal. The party would have faced having to pay the money back had the electoral watchdog reached the opposite
conclusion.
However, the commission added its regret that the Tories refused to agree to interviews and that Lord Ashcroft had
destroyed documents relating to the ownership of the company.

Taking On China
By PAUL KRUGMAN
Tensions are rising over Chinese economic policy, and rightly so: China's policy of keeping its currency, the renminbi,
undervalued has become a significant drag on global economic recovery. Something must be done.
To give you a sense of the problem: Widespread complaints that China was manipulating its currency — selling renminbi
and buying foreign currencies, so as to keep the renminbi weak and China's exports artificially competitive — began
around 2003. At that point China was adding about $10 billion a month to its reserves, and in 2003 it ran an overall
surplus on its current account — a broad measure of the trade balance — of $46 billion.
Today, China is adding more than $30 billion a month to its $2.4 trillion hoard of reserves. The International Monetary
Fund expects China to have a 2010 current surplus of more than $450 billion — 10 times the 2003 figure. This is the most
distortionary exchange rate policy any major nation has ever followed.
And it's a policy that seriously damages the rest of the world. Most of the world's large economies are stuck in a liquidity
trap — deeply depressed, but unable to generate a recovery by cutting interest rates because the relevant rates are
already near zero. China, by engineering an unwarranted trade surplus, is in effect imposing an anti-stimulus on these
economies, which they can't offset.
So how should we respond? First of all, the U.S. Treasury Department must stop fudging and obfuscating.
Twice a year, by law, Treasury must issue a report identifying nations that "manipulate the rate of exchange between their
currency and the United States dollar for purposes of preventing effective balance of payments adjustments or gaining
unfair competitive advantage in international trade." The law's intent is clear: the report should be a factual determination,
not a policy statement. In practice, however, Treasury has been both unwilling to take action on the renminbi and unwilling
to do what the law requires, namely explain to Congress why it isn't taking action. Instead, it has spent the past six or
seven years pretending not to see the obvious.
Will the next report, due April 15, continue this tradition? Stay tuned.
If Treasury does find Chinese currency manipulation, then what? Here, we have to get past a common misunderstanding:
the view that the Chinese have us over a barrel, because we don't dare provoke China into dumping its dollar assets.
What you have to ask is, What would happen if China tried to sell a large share of its U.S. assets? Would interest rates
soar? Short-term U.S. interest rates wouldn't change: they're being kept near zero by the Fed, which won't raise rates
until the unemployment rate comes down. Long-term rates might rise slightly, but they're mainly determined by market
expectations of future short-term rates. Also, the Fed could offset any interest-rate impact of a Chinese pullback by
expanding its own purchases of long-term bonds.
It's true that if China dumped its U.S. assets the value of the dollar would fall against other major currencies, such as the
euro. But that would be a good thing for the United States, since it would make our goods more competitive and reduce
our trade deficit. On the other hand, it would be a bad thing for China, which would suffer large losses on its dollar
holdings. In short, right now America has China over a barrel, not the other way around.
So we have no reason to fear China. But what should we do?
Some still argue that we must reason gently with China, not confront it. But we've been reasoning with China for years, as
its surplus ballooned, and gotten nowhere: on Sunday Wen Jiabao, the Chinese prime minister, declared — absurdly —
that his nation's currency is not undervalued. (The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that the
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767994 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767994 Date: 08/31/2015
renminbi is undervalued by between 20 and 40 percent.) And Mr. Wen accused other nations of doing what China actually
does, seeking to weaken their currencies "just for the purposes of increasing their own exports."
But if sweet reason won't work, what's the alternative? In 1971 the United States dealt with a similar but much less severe
problem of foreign undervaluation by imposing a temporary 10 percent surcharge on imports, which was removed a few
months later after Germany, Japan and other nations raised the dollar value of their currencies. At this point, it's hard to
see China changing its policies unless faced with the threat of similar action — except that this time the surcharge would
have to be much larger, say 25 percent.
I don't propose this turn to policy hardball lightly. But Chinese currency policy is adding materially to the world's economic
problems at a time when those problems are already very severe. It's time to take a stand.

Was Obama's confrontation with Israel premeditated'?

JERUSALEM—Suddenly, my city feels again like a war zone..Since the suicide bombings ended in 2005, life in
Jerusalem has been for the most part relatively calm. The worst disruptions have been the traffic jams resulting from
construction of a light rail. jUst like in a normal city. But navy, again, there are clusters of helmeted border nOtiCe near the
gates of the Old City. black smoke from burning tires in the Arab village across from my porch, young men marching with
green Islamist flags toward my neighborhood, ambulances parked at strategic places ready for this city's ultimate
nightmare.
The return of menace to Jerusalem is not because a mid-level bureaucrat announced stage four of a seven-stage process
in the eventual construction oft,600 apartments in Ramat Shiomo. a Jewish neighborhood in northeast Jerusalem. Such
announcements and building projects have become so routine over the years that Paestinians have scarcely responded,
let alone violently. In negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis, the permanence of Ramat Shiomo, and other Jewish
neighborhoods in East Jerusalem, has been a given. Ramat Shlomo, located between the Jewish neighborhoods of
French Hill and Rarrot, will remain within the boundaries of Israeli Jerusalem accord ng to every peace plan. Unlike the
Snail Jewish enclaves inserted into Arab neighbochoocis, on which Israelis are strongly buliding in the established
Jewish neighborhoods of East Jerusalem defines the national consensus.
Why, then, the outbreak of violence now? Why Harness "day of rage" over Jerusalem and the Palestinian Authority's call
to gather on the Temple Mount to "save" the Dome of the Rock from non-existent plans to build the Third Temple? Why

the sudden outrage over rebuilding a synagogue, destroyed by the Jordanians in 1948, in the Old City's Jewish Quarter,
when dozens of synagogues and yeshivas have been built in the quarter without incident?
The answer lies not in Jerusalem but in Washington. By placing the issue of building in Jewish neighborhoods in East
Jerusalem at the center of the peace process, President Obama has inadvertently challenged the Palestinians to do no
less.
Astonishingly. Obama is repeating the key tactical mistake of his failed efforts to restart Middle East peace talks over the
last year. Though Oben-la's insistence on a settlement freeze to help restart negotiations was legitimate, he went a step
too far by including building in East Jerusalem. Every Israeli government over the last four decades has built in the Jewish
neighborhoods of East Jerusalem; no government, let alone one headed by the Likud, could possibly agree to a freeze
there. Obama made resumption of negotiations hostage to a demand that could not be met. The result was that
Palestinian leaders were forced to adjust their demands accordingly.
Obama is directly responsible for one of the most absurd turns in the history of Middle East negotiations. Though
Palestinian leaders negotiated with Israeli governments that built extensively in the West Bank, they now refused to sit
down with the first Israeli government to actually agree to a suspension of building. Obama's demand for a building freeze
in Jerusalem led to a freeze in negotiations.
Finally, after intensive efforts, the administration produced the pathetic achievement of "proximity talks"—setting
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations back a generation, to the time when Palestinian leaders refused to sit at the same table
with Israelis.
That Obama could be guilty of such amateurishness was perhaps forgivable because he was, after ail, an amateur. But
he has now taken his failed policy and intensified it. By demanding that Israel stop building in Ramat Shlomo and
elsewhere in East Jerusalem—and placing that demand at the center of American-Israeli relations—he's ensured that the
Palestinians won't show up even to proximity talks. This is no longer amateurishness; it is pique disguised as policy.
Initially, when the announcement about building in Ramat Shlomo was made, Israelis shared Vice President Biden's
humiliation and were outraged at their government's incompetence. The widespread sense here was that Netanyahu
deserved the administration's condemnation, not because of what he did but because of what he didn't do: He failed to
convey to all parts of his government the need for caution during Biden's visit, symptomatic of his chaotic style of
governing generally.
But not even the opposition accused Netanyahu of a deliberate provocation. These are not the days of Yitzhak Shamir,
the former Israeli prime minister who used to greet a visit from Secretary of State James Baker with an announcement of
the creation of another West Bank settlement. Netanyahu has placed the need for strategic cooperation with the U.S. on
the Iranian threat ahead of the right-wing political agenda. That's why he included the Labor Party into his coalition, and
why he accepted a two-state solution—an historic achievement that set the Likud, however reluctantly, within the
mainstream consensus supporting Palestinian statehood. The last thing Netanyahu wanted was to embarrass Biden
during his goodwill visit and trigger a clash with Obama over an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood.
Nor is it likely that there was a deliberate provocation from the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, which runs the interior ministry
that oversees building procedures. Shas, which supports peace talks and territorial compromise, is not a nationalist party.
Its interest is providing housing for its constituents, like the future residents of Ramat Shlomo; provoking international
incidents is not its style.
Finally, the very ordinariness of the building procedure—the fact that construction in Jewish East Jerusalem is considered
by Israelis routine—is perhaps the best proof that there was no intentional ambush of Biden. Apparently no one in the
interior ministry could imagine that a long-term plan over Ramat Shiomo would sabotage a state visit.
In turning an incident into a crisis, Obama has convinced many Israelis that he was merely seeking, a pretext to pick a fight
with Israel. Netanyahu was inadvertently shabby; Obama, deliberately so.
Ac.t,cording to a banner headline in the newspaper Ma'ariv, senior Likud officials believe that Obama's goal is to topple the
Netanyahu government, by encouraging those in the Labor Party who want to quit the coalition.
The popular assumption is that Obama is seeking to prove his resolve as a leader by getting tough with Israel. Given his
ineffectiveness against Iran and his tendency to violate his own self-imposed deadlines for sanctions, the Israeli public is
not likely to be impressed. Indeed, Israelis' initial anger at Netanyahu has turned to anger against Obama. According to an
Israel Radio poll on March 16, 62 percent of Israelis blame the Obama administration for the crisis, while 20 percent
blame Netanyahu. (Another 17 percent blame Shas leader Eli Yishai.) •
In the last year, the administration has not once publicly condemned the Palestinians for lack of good faith—even though
the Palestinian Authority media has, for example, been waging a months-long campaign denying the Jews' historic roots
in Jerusalem. Just after Biden left Ramailah, Palestinian officials held a ceremony naming a square in the city after a
terrorist responsible for the massacre of 38 Israeli civilians. That too didn't merit an administration rebuke.
Obama's one-sided public pressure against Israel could intensify the atmosphere of "open season" against Israel
internationally. Indeed, the European Union has reaffirmed it is linking improved economic relations with Israel to the
resumption of the peace process—as if it's Israel rather than the Palestinians that has refused to come to the table.

If the administration's main tactical error in Middle East negotiating was emphasizing building in Jerusalem, its main
strategic error was assuming that a two-state solution was within easy reach. Shortly after Obama took office, Rehm
Emanuel vvas quoted in the Israeli press insisting that a Palestinian state would be created within Obama's first tent.
instead, a year later, we are in the era of suspended proximity talks. Now the administration is demanding that Israel
negotiate over final status issues in proximity talks as a way of convincing the Palestinians to agree to those talks--as if
Israelis would agree to discuss the future of Jerusalem when Palestinian leaders refuse to even sit with them.
To insist on the imminent possibility of a two-state solution requires amnesia. Biden's plea to Israelis to consider a
withdrawal to an approximation of the 1967 borders in exchange for peace ignored the fact that Israel made that offer
twice in the last decade: first, when Prime Minister Ehud Barak accepted the Clinton Proposals of December 2000, and
then more recently when Prime Minister Ehud Olmert renewed the offer to Mahrnoud Abbas. Abbas, says Olmert, never
replied.
The reason for Palestinian rejection of a two-state solution is because a deal would require Palestinians to confine the
return of the descendants of the 1948 refugees to Palestine rather than to Israel. That would prevent a two-state solution
from devolving into a bi-national, one-state solution. Israel's insistence on survival remains the obstacle to peace.
To achieve eventual peace, the international community needs to pressure Palestinian leaders to forgo their claim to Haifa
and Jaffa and confine their people's right of return to a future Palestinian state--just as the Jews will need to forgo their
claim to Hebron and Bethlehem and confine their people's right of return to the state of Israel. That is the only possible
deal: conceding my right of return to Greater Israel in exchange for your right of return to Greater Palestine. A majority of
Israelis—along with the political system—has accepted that principle. On the Palestinian side, the political system has
rejected it.
In the absence of Palestinian willingness to compromise on the right of return, negotiations should not focus on a two-
state solution but on more limited goals.
There have been positive signs of change on the Palestinian side in the last few years. The rise of Hamas has created
panic within Fatah, and the result is, for the first time, genuine security cooperation with Israel. Also, the emergence of
Salem Fayyad as Palestinian prime minister marks a shift from ideological to pragmatic leadership (though Fayyad still
lacks a power base). Finally, the West Bank economy is growing, thanks in part to Israel's removal of dozens of
roadblocks. The goal of negotiations at this point in the conflict should be to encourage those trends.
But by focusing on building in Jerusalem, Obama has undermined that possibility too. To the fictitious notion of a peace
process, Obama has now added the fiction of an intransigent Israel blocking the peace process.
The administration, according to a report in the Israeli ne\Aispaper Yedito Aharonot, is making an even more insidious
accusation against Israel. During his visit, wrote Yediot Aharanot, Bicien told Israeli leaders that their policies are
endangering American lives in Afghanistan and Iraq. The report has been denied in the White House. Whether or not the
remark was made, what is clear today in Jerusalem is that Obama's recklessness is endangering Israeli--and Palestinian--
lives. As I listen to police sirens outside my window, Obama's political Intifada against Netanyahu seems to be turning into
a third intifada over Jerusalem.

Why Axelrod, however? Sure, the Sunday morning talk shows wanted to talk health care as well. And it's true that
Axelrod, thought of as pro-Israel, could send a tough signal. Still, couldn't the administration have sent Hillary Clinton to

The Petraeus briefing: Biden's embarrassment is not the whole story
Posted By Mark Perry <http://www.foreignpolicy.com/images/091022_meta_block.gif> Saturday, March 13, 2010 -
On Jan. 16, two days after a killer earthquake hit Haiti, a team of senior military officers from the U.S. Central Command
(responsible for overseeing American security interests in the Middle East), arrived at the Pentagon to brief Joint Chiefs
of Staff Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The team had been dispatched by CENTCOM
commander Gen. David Petraeus to underline his growing worries at the lack of progress in resolving the issue. The 33-
slide, 45-minute PowerPoint briefing stunned Mullen. The briefers reported that there was a growing perception among
Arab leaders that the U.S. was incapable of standing up to Israel, that CENTCOM's mostly Arab constituency was losing

faith in American promises, that Israeli intransigence on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was jeopardizing U.S. standing in
the region, and that Mitchell himself was (as a senior Pentagon officer later bluntly described it) "too old, too slow ...
and too late."
The January Mullen briefing was unprecedented. No previous CENTCOM commander had ever expressed himself on
what is essentially a political issue; which is why the briefers were careful to tell Mullen that their conclusions followed
from a December 2009 tour of the region where, on Petraeus's instructions, they spoke to senior Arab leaders.
"Everywhere they went, the message was pretty humbling,' a Pentagon officer familiar with the briefing says. "America
was not only viewed as weak, but its military posture in the region was eroding." But Petraeus wasn't finished: two days
after the Mullen briefing, Petraeus sent a paper to the White House requesting that the West Bank and Gaza (which,
with Israel, is a part of the European Command -- or EUCOM), be made a part of his area of operations. Petraeus's
reason was straightforward: with U.S. troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. military had to be perceived by
Arab leaders as engaged in the region's most troublesome conflict.
[UPDATE: A senior military officer denied Sunday that Petraeus sent a paper to the White House.
"CENTCOM did have a team brief the CJCS on concerns revolving around the Palestinian issue, and CENTCOM did
propose a UCP change, but to CJCS, not to the WH," the officer said via email. "GEN Petraeus was not certain what might
have been conveyed to the WH (if anything) from that brief to CJCS."
(UCP means "unified combatant command," like CENTCOM; CJCS refers to Mullen; and WH is the White House.)] The
Mullen briefing and Petraeus's request hit the White House like a bombshell. While Petraeus's request that CENTCOM
be expanded to include the Palestinians was denied ("it was dead on arrival," a Pentagon officer confirms), the Obama
administration decided it would redouble its efforts pressing Israel once again on the settlements issue, sending
Mitchell on a visit to a number of Arab capitals and dispatching Mullen for a carefully arranged meeting with the chief of
the Israeli General Staff, Lt. General Gabi Ashkenazi. While the American press speculated that Mullen's trip focused on
Iran, the JCS Chairman actually carried a blunt, and tough; message on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: that Israel had to
see its conflict with the Palestinians "in a larger, regional, context" -- as having a direct impact on America's status in the
region. Certainly, it was thought, Israel would get the message.
Israel didn't. When Vice President Joe Biden was embarrassed by an Israeli announcement that the Netanyahu
government was building 1,600 new homes in East Jerusalem, the administration reacted. But no one was more
outraged than Biden who, according to the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth, engaged in a private, and angry, exchange
with the Israeli Prime Minister Not surprisingly, what Biden told Netanyahu reflected the importance the administration
attached to Petraeus's Mullen briefing: "This is starting to get dangerous for us," Biden reportedly told Netanyahu.
"What you're doing here undermines the security of our troops who are fighting in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. That
endangers us and it endangers regional peace." Yedioth Ahronoth went on to report: "The vice president told his Israeli
hosts that since many people in the Muslim world perceived a connection between Israel's actions and US policy, any
decision about construction that undermines Palestinian rights in East Jerusalem could have an impact on the personal
safety of American troops fighting against Islamic terrorism." The message couldn't be plainer: Israel's intransigence
could cost American lives.
There are important and powerful lobbies in America: the NRA, the American Medical Association, the lawyers -- and the
Israeli lobby. But no lobby is as important, or as powerful, as the U.S. military. While commentators and pundits might
reflect that Joe Biden's trip to Israel has forever shifted America's relationship with its erstwhile ally in the region, the
real break came in January, when David Petraeus sent a briefing team to the Pentagon with a stark warning: America's
relationship with Israel is important, but not as important as the lives of America's soldiers. Maybe Israel gets the
message now.

My piece on the briefing of Admiral Mullen by CENTCOM senior officers has occasioned a great deal of comment, as well
as some skepticism: how accurate is the account? Was it told to me by direct participants in the briefing? Is there any
basis for imagining that Petraeus has any kind of hidden agenda, whether that is a desire to expand CENTCOM — or even
hostility towards Israel.
I won't name my sources, even though it's clear to people in the Pentagon — and certainly to General Petraeus — who
they are. Was I told of the briefing by the briefers themselves? I will only say that there were four people in the briefing

—the two briefers, Admiral Mullen, and Admiral Mullen's primary adviser on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I know two
of the people involved in the briefing. Whether or not they are my sources is something for the reader to determine. The
account is not only accurate, it's a precis of what actually happened. There is a lot more to it. The White House, State
Department and Pentagon have not denied the account, and for good reason: it's true.
Is there any basis for imagining that Petraeus has any kind of hidden agenda in ordering the briefing?
I have been reporting on the American military for thirty years. My work on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Four Stars
<http://www.amazon.com/Four-Stars-Forty-Year-Americas-Civilian/dp/0395429234> , is the authoritative account on
the subject. I have deeply rooted contacts in the military that go back thirty years. I have never met a senior military
officer whom I do not admire. There is no greater insult than to believe that General Petraeus or any other senior
American military officer would use the lives of American soldiers as a lever to enhance their own political future. My
sense is that General Petraeus neither likes nor dislikes Israel: but he loves his country and he wants to protect our
soldiers. The current crisis in American relations with Israel is not a litmus test of General Petraeus's loyalty to Israel, but
of his, and our, concern for those Americans in uniform in the Middle East.
It is, perhaps, a sign of the depth of "the Biden crisis" that every controversy of this type seems to get translated into
whether or not America and its leaders are committed to Israel's security. This isn't about Israel's security, it's about our
security.

Netanyahu and Pastor Hagee's Lovefest on Eve of Biden's Arrival in Israel <http://maxblumenthal.com/2010/03/pastor-
hagee-and-netanyahus-lovefest-on-eve-of-bidens-arrival-in-israel/>
On 03.09.10, By Max
(Videos recorded by Rachel Tabachnick <http://zeek.forward.com/authors/rachel-tabachnick>; more videos coming
shortly.) Vice President Joe Biden was greeted in Jerusalem with the announcement
<http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/articielALeciM5ioi_Ojt09RjMwPNRoXNCndRPRq3gD9EB9N580> that the
Israeli Interior Ministry approved the construction of 1600 new homes in Occupied East Jerusalem contrary to U.S.
wishes and complicating Biden's mission <http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/mar/07/joe-biden-israel-palestinian-
talks> to help jump start the peace process. But Biden should have known that Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu intended
to upset his plans by Netanyahu's appearance with John Hagee.
The day after a series of talks between US Special Envoy for the Middle East George Mitchell and Netanyahu, and a day
before Biden's arrival, Netanyahu appeared onstage with Pastor John Hagee in Jerusalem. The occasion was Hagee's
Night To Honor Israel, an event the far-right Texas-based preacher arranged to tout his ministry's millions in donations
to Israeli organizations and to level bellicose rhetoric against Israel's perceived enemies.
At the gathering, Hagee called Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad "the Hitler of the Middle East" and denounced
the Goldstone Report as "character assassination by an unbiased and uninformed committee."
Netanyahu welcomed the crowd of 1000 American evangelicals to Jerusalem, a city he described as "the undivided,
eternal capitol of the Jewish people. Then, he told them, "I salute you! The Jewish people salute you!" He used the rest
of his speech to call for "tough, biting sanctions" against Iran that "bite deep into its energy sector."
Hagee and Netanyahu appear together on stage:
In the audience were top-level members of the Israeli government, from Ambassador Michael Oren to Jerusalem Mayor
'Mr Barkat to Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon. Also present was Rabbi Shlorno Riskin, the chief rabbi of the illegal
West Bank settlement of Efrat who gained notoriety for lobbying President Bill Clinton to pardon his friend, fugitive
billionaire Marc Rich. Ayalon had stirred controversy <http://haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1150484.html> days before
when he refused to meet with a US congressional delegation brought to Israel by the progressive Jewish group J Street.

Hagee's ceremony featured a 15-minute film highlighting the recipients of donations from John Hagee Ministries that
totaled $58 million since 2001. The recipients included Jewish settlements from the West Bank like Gush Etzion and
Shomron, which was involved in promoting an "Obama Hilltop project"
<http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/277856,jewish-settlers-launch-obama-hilltop-project.html> that promoted
more settlement building and compared Obama to Pharoah. Hagee also announced funding for a pressure group run by
the settlers evacuated from Gush Katif in Gaza in 2005. During Israel's assault on Gaza in 2009, a group of Gush Katif
residents lobbied <http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1054491.html> the Israel government to allow them to
resettle the Palestinian coastal region.
Who is Hagee funding in Israel?
Who Is Hagee Funding In Israel? <http://vimeo.com/10027708> from Max Blumenthal
<http://vimeo.com/user1924826> on Vimeo <http://vimeo.com> .
The most notable of Hagee's funding recipients was an organization called Im Tirtzu. A student representative of this
group appeared in the film to thank Hagee for "help[ing] us to ensure that students in Israel are on the right path, the
path of Zionism, the love of Israel, the path of solidarity." Another student called for "the second revolution in Israel."
In February, Im Tirtzu funding a smear campaign against former Knesset member and New Israel Fund Director Naomi
Chazan <http://www.nif.org/meclia-center/press-releases/former-mk-naomi.html> that included posters caricaturing
her with a horn on her head. The group misleadingly accused the New Israel Fund of bankrolling 16 human rights
organizations that contributed documentation to the Goldstone Report.
The smear campaign led to unsuccessful legislation in the Knesset designed to further cripple already marginalized
Israeli human rights groups. Meanwhile, the Jerusalem Post fired
<http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1147783.html> Chazan as a columnist without explanation. Gideon Levy, a
columnist for Ha'aretz, called <http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1148014.html> Irn Tirtzu "a McCarthyite
movement" for its attacks on Chazan.
Although CUR attempted to distance itself <http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNlews/Article.aspx?id=167666>
from Im Tirtzu's campaign, the organization's appearance during CUR's Jerusalem ceremony suggested that Hagee
would continue to provide it with funding well into the future.
Republican Senator John McCain repudiated the endorsement
<http://www.cnn.corn/2008/POLITICS/05/22/mccain.hagee/index.html> of Hagee during his 2008 presidential
campaign after Hagee's statements describing the Holocaust as a fulfillment of divine prophecy came to light. Hagee has
also said that <http://www.huffingtonpost.com/max-blumenthal/pastor-hagee-the-antichri_b_104608.html> he
believed the anti-Christ was "partially Jewish, as was Adolph Hitler." However, none of Hagee's comments have deterred
Israeli government officials from embracing him or accepting his millions in annual charity.
During Hagee's speech, he made no secret of his support for the illegal settlement enterprise that has been the source
of difficulties between the US and Israel. "The settlements are not the problem," he boomed from the podium. "The
problem is the refusal of Arab leaders to respect the right of Jewish people to live anywhere in the Middle East."
Hagee received a rousing ovation from the crowd and the Israeli government officials seated beside the podium when
he proclaimed, "World leaders do not have the authority to tell Israel and the Jewish people what they can and cannot
do in the city of Jerusalem. They don't have the authority to tell them what they can and cannot build, who can and and
cannot live there."
The following day, on March 9, Vice President Joseph Biden arrived in Israel to meet with Netanyahu and officials from
the Palestinian Authority. He told reporters <http://haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1155106.html> after touching down
that he saw "a moment of real opportunity."

Labour c.uIi win most seats at eneral
election, poll shows
Guardian/ICM poll reveals gap between two main parties at four points — the closest in an ICM poll for almost two years
• Julian Glover
• aardian.co.uk, Monday 5 April 2010 19.02 BST
• Article history
Lbr still has a fighting chance of winning the most seats in the general election, according to a Guardian/1CM poll
published today.
The findings suggest Tory hopes of a defining breakthrough have been overplayed, with the gap between the two main
parties now at just four points — the closest in an 1CM poll for almost two years.
Labour support has climbed four points to 33% since an ICM poll carried out for the Guardian last week. Conservative
backing has dropped one since then to 37% — Labour's best ICM rating since December 2008 and the Tories' worst since
February.
On a uniform national swing, these figures could leave Labour 30 seats short of an overall majority. Even if the Tories
perform better than average in marginal seats — as most people expect — David Cameron would struggle to establish a
secure parliamentary basis for power.
Either party could be left dependent on the fiber:a) Democrats, who are on 21% in the poll — down two from last week.
Despite that decline, the Lib Dems will be pleased by the strength of their position going into the election. The party has
been at or above 20% in seven of this year's 11 ICM polls.
Meanwhile support for other parties, which peaked last spring in the European elections, has fallen again to just 9%.
At the start of an election campaign likely to see more polling than ever before in British politics, today's figures will be
treated with caution unless confirmed by other surveys.
Some polls late last week suggested the Conservative lead had grown rather than shrunk, and research may have been
affected by the Easter holidays, when some voters would have been away from home. Yet the results suggest that
Labour's chances should not be written off, and events such as the leaders' debates could prove decisive in the coming
weeks.
Today's poll suggests 60% of people are planning to watch at least one debate, with 29% saying they plan to watch all
three. Only 39% of voters said they would not watch any of them.
The ICM survey also asked voters whether they might switch away from their first choice party and, if so;who they might
back instead.
Labour and Tory support is now equally solid. Overall, 71% of Labour supporters say they will definitely back Labour while
71% of Tories also say they will stick with their first choice party.
Lib Dems, however, are less loyal — only 52% are sure they will end up giving Nick Clegg their vote. That leaves just over
a quarter of each main party's supporters considering backing another party.

The proportion of Lib Dems and ConservatIves. saying they might vote Labour instead has doubled since ICM last asked
this question earlier in the year. The ICM figures suggest the maximum potential vote for Labour and the Conservatives —
all their definite supporters, plus all potential switchers — is running neck and neck at 42%. The Lib Dem maximum is 28%.
Realistically, Labour is unlikely to beat its 2005 share of 36% and even today's poll suggesting it has shed only three
points since then will surprise many. Nonetheless, there is all to play for as the contest begins now.
•ICM Research interviewed a random sample of 1,001 adults aged 18 and over by telephone on 1-3 April 2010.
Interviews were conducted across the country, and the results weighted to the profile of all adults. 1CM is a member of the
British Polling Council and abides by its rules.

The Doomsday Weapon
IT IS already a commonplace to say that people who don't learn from history are condemned
to repeat their mistakes.
Some 1942 years ago, the Jews in the province called Palaestina launched a revolt against the
Roman Empire. In retrospect, this looks like an act of madness. Palestine was a small and
insignificant part of the world-wide empire which had just won a crushing victory against the
rival power — the Parthian Empire (Persia) — and put down a major rebellion in Britain. What
chances could the Jewish revolt have?
God knows what was going on in the mind of the "Zealots". They eliminated the moderate
leaders, who warned against provoking the empire, and gained sway over the Jewish
population of the country. They relied on God. Perhaps they also relied on the Jews in Rome
and believed that their influence over the Senate would restrain the Emperor, Nero. Perhaps
they had heard that Nero was weak and about to fall.
We know how it ended: after three years, the rebels were crushed, Jerusalem fell and the
temple was burned down. The last of the Zealots committed suicide in Masada.
The Zionists did indeed try to learn from history. They acted in a rational way, did not provoke
the great powers, endeavored in every situation to attain what was possible. They accepted
compromises, and every compromise served them as a basis for the next surge forward. They
cleverly utilized the radical stance of their adversaries and gained the sympathy of the whole
world.
But since the beginning of the occupation, their mind has become clouded. The cult of
Masada has become dominant. Divine promises once again start to play a role in public
discourse. Large parts of the public are following the new zealots.
The next phase is also repeating itself: the leaders of Israel are starting a rebellion against the
new Rome.
WHAT BEGAN as an insult to the Vice President of the United States is developing into
something far bigger. The mouse has given birth to an elephant.

Lately, the ultra-right government in Jerusalem has started to treat President Barack Obama
with thinly veiled contempt. The fears that arose in Jerusalem at the beginning of his term
have dissipated. Obama looks to them like a paper black panther. He gave up his demand for a
real settlement freeze. Every time he was spat on, he remarked that it was raining.
Yet now, ostensibly quite suddenly, the measure is full. Obama, his Vice President and his
senior assistants condemn the Netanyahu government with growing severity. Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton has submitted an ultimatum: Netanyahu must stop all settlement activity,
East Jerusalem included; he must agree to negotiate about all core problems of the conflict,
including East Jerusalem, and more.
The surprise was complete. Obama, it seems, has crossed the Rubicon, much as the Egyptian
army had crossed the Suez Canal in 1973. Netanyahu gave the order to mobilize all the
reserves in America and to move forward all the diplomatic tanks. All Jewish organizations in
the US were commanded to join the campaign. AIPAC blew the shofar and ordered its
soldiers, the Senators and Congressmen, to storm the White House.
It seems that the decisive battle has been joined. The Israeli leaders were certain that Obama
would be defeated.
And then an unusual noise was heard: the sound of the doomsday weapon.
THE MAN who decided to activate it was a foe of a new kind.
David Petraeus is the most popular officer of the United States army. The four-star general,
son of a Dutch sea captain who went to America when his country was overrun by the Nazis,
stood out from early childhood. In West Point he was a "distinguished cadet", in Army
Command and General Staff College he was No. 1. As a combat commander, he reaped
plaudits. He wrote his doctoral thesis (on the lessons of Vietnam) at Princeton and served as
an assistant professor for international relations in the US Military Academy.
He made his mark in Iraq, when he commanded the forces in Mosul, the most problematical
city in the country. He concluded that in order to vanquish the enemies of the US he must win
over the hearts of the civilian population, acquire local allies and spend more money than
ammunition. The locals called him King David. His success was considered so outstanding
that his methods were adopted as the official doctrine of the American army.
His star rose rapidly. He was appointed commander of the coalition forces in Iraq and soon
became the chief of the Central Command of the US army, which covers the whole Middle East
, except Israel and Palestine (which "belong" to the American command in Europe).
When such a person raises his voice, the American people listen. As a respected military
thinker, he has no rivals.
THIS WEEK, Petraeus conveyed an unequivocal message: after reviewing the problems in his
AOR (Area Of Responsibility) — which includes, among others, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran,
Iraq and Yemen — he turned to what he called the "root causes of instability" in the region. The
list was topped by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768302 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768302 Date: 08/31/2015
In his report to the Armed Services Committee he stated: "The enduring hostilities between
Israel and some of its neighbors present distinct challenges to our ability to advance our
interests in the AOR...The conflict foments anti-American sentiment, due to a perception of
U.S. favoritism for Israel. Arab anger over the Palestinian question limits the strength and
depth of U.S. partnerships with governments and peoples in the AOR and weakens the
legitimacy of moderate regimes in the Arab world. Meanwhile, al-Qaeda and other militant
groups exploit that anger to mobilize support. The conflict also gives Iran influence in the
Arab world through its clients, Lebanese Hizballah and Hamas."
Not content with that, Petraeus sent his officers to present his conclusions to the Joint Chiefs
of Staff,
In other words: Israeli-Palestinian peace is not a private matter between the two parties, but a
supreme national interest of the USA. That means that the US must give up its one-sided
support for the Israeli government and impose the two-state solution.
The argument as such is not new. Several experts have said more or less the same in the past.
(Immediately after the 9/11 attacks, I wrote in a similar vein and prophesied that the US would
change its policy. It did not happen then.) But now this is being stated in an official document
written by the responsible American commander.
The Netanyahu government immediately went into damage-limitation mode. Its
spokespersons declared that Petraeus represents a narrow military approach, that he doesn't
understand political matters, that his reasoning is faulty. But it is not this that made people in
Jerusalem break out into cold sweat.
AS IS well known, the pro-Israel lobby dominates the American political system without limits
— almost. Every American politician and senior official is mortally afraid of it. The slightest
deviation from the strict AIPAC line is tantamount to political suicide.
But in the armor of this political Goliath there is a chink. Like Achilles' heel, the immense
might of the pro-Israel lobby has a vulnerable point that, when touched, can neutralize its
power.
It was illustrated by the Jonathan Pollard affair. This American-Jewish employee of a sensitive
intelligence agency spied for Israel. Israelis consider him a national hero, a Jew who did his
duty to his people. But for the US intelligence community, he is a traitor who endangered the
lives of many American agents. Not satisfied with a routine penalty, it induced the court to
impose a life sentence. Since then, all American presidents have refused the requests of
successive Israeli governments to commute the sentence. No president dared to confront his
intelligence chiefs in this matter.
But the most significant side of this affair is reminiscent of the famous words of Sherlock
Holmes about the dogs that did not bark. AIPAC did not bark. The entire American Jewish
community fell silent. Almost nobody raised their voice for poor Pollard.
Why? Because most American Jews are ready to do anything — just anything — for the
government of Israel. With one exception: they will not do anything that appears to hurt the
security of the United States. When the flag of security is hoisted, the Jews, like all Americans,
snap to attention and salute. The Damocles sword of suspicion of disloyalty hangs above their
heads. For them, this is the ultimate nightmare: to be accused of putting the security of Israel

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768302 Date: 08/31/2015
ahead of the security of the US. Therefore it is important for them to repeat endlessly the
mantra that the interests of Israel and the US are identical.
And now comes the most important general of the US Army and says that this is not so. The
policy of the present Israeli government is endangering the lives of American soldiers in Iraq
and Afghanistan.
FOR NOW, this is being said only as a side remark, in a military document that has not been
widely aired. But the sword has been drawn from its scabbard - and American Jews have
started to tremble at the distant rumble of an approaching earthquake.
This week, Netanyahu's brother-in-law has used our own doomsday weapon. He declared that
Obama is an "anti-Semite". The official newspaper of the Shas party has asserted that Obama
is really a Muslim. They represent the radical right and its allies, who argue in speech and in
writing that "Hussein" Obama is a Jew-hating black who must be beaten in the coming
congressional elections and in the next presidential ones.
(Yet an important poll in Israel published yesterday shows that the Israeli public is far from
convinced by these insinuations: the vast majority believes that Obama's treatment of Israel is
fair. Indeed, Obama got higher marks than Netanyahu.)
If Obama decides to fight back and activate his doomsday weapon - the accusation that Israel
puts the lives of American servicemen at risk - this would have catastrophic consequences
for Israel.
For the time being, this is only a shot across the bow - a warning shot fired by a warship in
order to induce another vessel to follow its instructions. The warning is clear. Even if the
•present crisis is somehow damped down, it will inevitably flare up again and again as long as
the present coalition in Israel stays in power.
When the movie "Hurt Locker" won its awards, the entire American public was united in its
concern about the lives of its soldiers in the Middle East. If this public becomes convinced
that Israel is sticking a knife in their back, it will be a disaster for Netanyahu. And not just for
him.

From Times Online

Tory lead narrows amid huge voter
disenchantment, Times poll finds
olmage :1 of 20,
Peter Riddell
The general election race is tightening, according to a Populus poll for The Times that reveals deep public
disenchantment with the campaign so far.
The poll, undertaken yesterday and this morning, says that more voters are now hoping for a hung parliament than either
a Tory or a Labour outright victory.
Conservative support has slipped by three points over the past week to 36 per cent, while Labour is a point up at 33 per
cent. The Liberal Democrats are unchanged on 21 per cent.
The polls tend to fluctuate by a couple of points either way. and these shifts are within the margin of error of the average.
With other new polls pointing to a firming in Labour support, the party may have enjoyed a small boost from its manifesto
launch. Tory strategists will hope to have achieved a boost from its manifesto launch today.
If the Populus figures were repeated in the general election in three weeks' time, and there is a uniform switch in votes,
Labour would be the largest single party, with about 300 MPs, ahead of the Tories on 264 and the Lib Dems on 54. This
would point to a Lab/Lib Dem coalition. But many analysts do not expect a uniform national swing.
The latest poll shows that 32 per cent of the public now hope for a hung parliament (as opposed to expecting one),
against 28 per cent wanting a Tory majority and 22 per cent a Labour one. Lib Dem voters prefer a deal with Labour than
the Tories in a hung parliament, by 44 to 31 per cent. The public is evenly split 40 to 42 per cent about whether they want
Labour or the Tories in either a majority or a minority government.
The poll shows that the number expecting a Tory overall majority has risen by three points to 34 per cent over the past
week. This only just exceeds the number expecting a hung parliament, at 33 per cent, down six points compared with a
week ago. Overall, 57 per cent expect the Tories to be the largest party, against 29 per cent expecting Labour to be.
The public is deeply sceptical about the honesty of the parties. Only 4 per cent think that they are being completely honest
about their tax plans, 61 per cent partly honest. Only 6 per cent say they are being completely honest about cutting the
deficit and 61 per cent partly honest. Some 7 per cent say that they are being completely honest about the extent to which
they can fund their policies by cutting waste and 58 per cent partly honest.
Voters were asked to say which party had proposed eight key manifesto pledges. They wrongly identified four: reducing
the increase in national insurance contributions (naming Labour not the Tories); allowing unsuccessful schools, hospitals
and the police (the Tories, not Labour); tightening up takeover rules (the Tories not Labour); and requiring foreign workers
employed in public services to speak fluent English (the Tories not Labour).
In only one case, the £150-a-year tax break, did more than half of voters (60 per cent) correctly identify the party making
the proposal.

In most cases, the pledge will make little difference to people's votes, apart from three made by Labour: the foreign
workers language pledge, doubling paid paternity leave and allowing the takover of unsuccessful schools, hospitals etc.
More than two fifths (43 per cent), including 50 per cent of women, say "none of the parties", or "don't know", when asked
which party is putting across a convincing cases to voters. This compares with 25 per cent naming the Tories and 18 per
cent Labour.
Just over half the public (54 per cent) plan to watch the first televised leaders' debate on Thursday evening. Men and
middle class professionals are more likely to say that they will view. More than two fifths (42 per cent) expect David
Cameron to win the debate, against 22 per cent for Gordon Brown. More Tories (70 per cent) than Labour voters ( 57 per
cent) expect their leader to win.
Two fifths of the public (42 per cent, up one point on a week ago) say it seems like a change from Labour, but are not sure
that it is time for a change to the Conservatives. Some 33 per cent, down one point, think it is time for a change to the
Tories.

The general election race is tightening, according to a Populus poll for The Times that reveals deep public
disenchantment with the campaign so far.
The poll, undertaken yesterday and this morning, says that more voters are now hoping for a hung parliament than
either a Tory or a Labour outright victory.
Conservative support has slipped by three points over the past week to 36 per cent, while Labour is a point up at 33 per
cent. The Liberal Democrats are unchanged on 21 per cent.
The polls tend to fluctuate by a couple of points either way, and these shifts are within the margin of error of the
average.

With other new polls pointing to a firming in Labour support, the party may have enjoyed a small boost from its
manifesto launch. Tory strategists will hope to have achieved a boost from its manifesto launch today.
If the Populus figures were repeated in the general election in three weeks' time, and there is a uniform switch in votes,
Labour would be the largest single party, with about 300 MPs, ahead of the Tories on 264 and the Lib Dems on 54. This
would point to a Lab/Lib Dem coalition. But many analysts do not expect a uniform national swing.
The latest poll shows that 32 per cent of the public now hope for a hung parliament (as opposed to expecting one),
against 28 per cent wanting a Tory majority and 22 per cent a Labour one. Lib Dem voters prefer a deal with Labour than
the Tories in a hung parliament, by 44 to 31 per cent. The public is evenly split 40 to 42 per cent about whether they
want Labour or the Tories in either a majority or a minority government.
The poll shows that the number expecting a Tory overall majority has risen by three points to 34 per cent over the past

The Doomsday Weapon
IT IS already a commonplace to say that people who don't learn from history are condemned to repeat their mistakes.
Some 1942 years ago, the Jews in the province called Palaestina launched a revolt against the Roman Empire. In
retrospect, this looks like an act of madness. Palestine was a small and insignificant part of the world-wide empire which
had just won a crushing victory against the rival power — the Parthian Empire (Persia) — and put down a major rebellion
in Britain. What chances could the Jewish revolt have?
God knows what was going on in the mind of the "Zealots". They eliminated the moderate leaders, who warned against
provoking the empire, and gained sway over the Jewish population of the country. They relied on God. Perhaps they also
relied on the Jews in Rome and believed that their influence over the Senate would restrain the Emperor, Nero. Perhaps
they had heard that Nero was weak and about to fall.
We know how it ended: after three years, the rebels were crushed, Jerusalem fell and the temple was burned down. The
last of the Zealots committed suicide in Masada.
The Zionists did indeed try to learn from history. They acted in a rational way, did not provoke the great powers,
endeavored in every situation to attain what was possible. They accepted compromises, and every compromise served

them as a basis for the next surge forward. They cleverly utilized the radical stance of their adversaries and gained the
sympathy of the whole world.
But since the beginning of the occupation, their mind has become clouded. The cult of Masada has become dominant.
Divine promises once again start to play a role in public discourse. Large parts of the public are following the new
zealots.
The next phase is also repeating itself: the leaders of Israel are starting a rebellion against the new Rome.
WHAT BEGAN as an insult to the Vice President of the United States is developing into something far bigger. The mouse
has given birth to an elephant.
Lately, the ultra-right government in Jerusalem has started to treat President Barack Obama with thinly veiled contempt.
The fears that arose in Jerusalem at the beginning of his term have dissipated. Obama looks to them like a paper black
panther. He gave up his demand for a real settlement freeze. Every time he was spat on, he remarked that it was raining.
Yet now, ostensibly quite suddenly, the measure is full. Obama, his Vice President and his senior assistants condemn the
Netanyahu government with growing severity. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has submitted an ultimatum: Netanyahu
must stop all settlement activity, East Jerusalem included; he must agree to negotiate about all core problems of the
conflict, including East Jerusalem, and more.
The surprise was complete. Obama, it seems, has crossed the Rubicon, much as the Egyptian army had crossed the Suez
Canal in 1973. Netanyahu gave the order to mobilize all the reserves in America and to move forward all the diplomatic
tanks. All Jewish organizations in the US were commanded to join the campaign. A1PAC blew the shofar and ordered its
soldiers, the Senators and Congressmen, to storm the White House.
It seems that the decisive battle has been joined. The Israeli leaders were certain that Obama would be defeated.
And then an unusual noise was heard: the sound of the doomsday weapon.
THE MAN who decided to activate it was a foe of a new kind.
David Petraeus is the most popular officer of the United States army. The four-star general, son of a Dutch sea captain
who went to America when his country was overrun by the Nazis, stood out from early childhood. In West Point he was
a "distinguished cadet", in Army Command and General Staff College he was No. 1. As a combat commander, he reaped
plaudits. He wrote his doctoral thesis (on the lessons of Vietnam) at Princeton and served as an assistant professor for
international relations in the US Military Academy.
He made his mark in Iraq, when he commanded the forces in Mosul, the most problematical city in the country. He
concluded that in order to vanquish the enemies of the US he must win over the hearts of the civilian population,
acquire local allies and spend more money than ammunition. The locals called him King David. His success was
considered so outstanding that his methods were adopted as the official doctrine of the American army.
His star rose rapidly. He was appointed commander of the coalition forces in Iraq and soon became the chief of the
Central Command of the US army, which covers the whole Middle East, except Israel and Palestine (which "belong" to
the American command in Europe).
When such a person raises his voice, the American people listen. As a respected military thinker, he has no rivals.

THIS WEEK, Petraeus conveyed an unequivocal message: after reviewing the problems in his AOR (Area Of
Responsibility) — which includes, among others, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq and Yemen — he turned to what he
called the "root causes of instability" in the region. The list was topped by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
In his report to the Armed Services Committee he stated: "The enduring hostilities between Israel and some of its
neighbors present distinct challenges to our ability to advance our interests in the AOR...The conflict foments anti-
American sentiment, due to a perception of U.S. favoritism for Israel. Arab anger over the Palestinian question limits the
strength and depth of U.S. partnerships with governments and peoples in the AOR and weakens the legitimacy of
moderate regimes in the Arab world. Meanwhile, al-Qaeda and other militant groups exploit that anger to mobilize
support. The conflict also gives Iran influence in the Arab world through its clients, Lebanese Hizballah and Hamas."
Not content with that, Petraeus sent his officers to present his conclusions to the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
In other words: Israeli-Palestinian peace is not a private matter between the two parties, but a supreme national
interest of the USA. That means that the US must give up its one-sided support for the Israeli government and impose
the two-state solution.
The argument as such is not new. Several experts have said more or less the same in the past. (Immediately after the
9/11 attacks, I wrote in a similar vein and prophesied that the US would change its policy. It did not happen then.) But
now this is being stated in an official document written by the responsible American commander.
The Netanyahu government immediately went into damage-limitation mode. Its spokespersons declared that Petraeus
represents a narrow military approach, that he doesn't understand political matters, that his reasoning is faulty. But it is
not this that made people in Jerusalem break out into cold sweat.
AS IS well known, the pro-Israel lobby dominates the American political system without limits — almost. Every American
politician and senior official is mortally afraid of it. The slightest deviation from the strict AIPAC line is tantamount to
political suicide.
But in the armor of this political Goliath there is a chink. Like Achilles' heel, the immense might of the pro-Israel lobby
has a vulnerable point that, when touched, can neutralize its power.
It was illustrated by the Jonathan Pollard affair. This American-Jewish employee of a sensitive intelligence agency spied
for Israel. Israelis consider him a national hero, a Jew who did his duty to his people. But for the US intelligence
community, he is a traitor who endangered the lives of many American agents. Not satisfied with a routine penalty, it
induced the court to impose a life sentence. Since then, all American presidents have refused the requests of successive
Israeli governments to commute the sentence. No president dared to confront his intelligence chiefs in this matter.
But the most significant side of this affair is reminiscent of the famous words of Sherlock Holmes about the dogs that did
not bark. A1PAC did not bark. The entire American Jewish community fell silent. Almost nobody raised their voice for
poor Pollard.
Why? Because most American Jews are ready to do anything —just anything —for the government of Israel. With one
exception: they will not do anything that appears to hurt the security of the United States. When the flag of security is
hoisted, the Jews, like all Americans, snap to attention and salute. The Damocles sword of suspicion of disloyalty hangs
above their heads. For them, this is the ultimate nightmare: to be accused of putting the security of Israel ahead of the
security of the US. Therefore it is important for them to repeat endlessly the mantra that the interests of Israel and the
US are identical.
And now comes the most important general of the US Army and says that this is not so. The policy of the present Israeli
government is endangering the lives of American soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768358 Date: 08/31/2015
FOR NOW, this is being said only as a side remark, in a military document that has not been widely aired. But the sword
has been drawn from its scabbard — and American Jews have started to tremble at the distant rumble of an approaching
earthquake.
This week, Netanyahu's brother-in-law has used our own doomsday weapon. He declared that Obama is an "anti-
Semite". The official newspaper of the Shas party has asserted that Obama is really a Muslim. They represent the radical
right and its allies, who argue in speech and in writing that "Hussein" Obama is a Jew-hating black who must be beaten
in the coming congressional elections and in the next presidential ones.
(Yet an important poll in Israel published yesterday shows that the Israeli public is far from convinced by these
insinuations: the vast majority believes that Obama's treatment of Israel is fair. Indeed, Obama got higher marks than
Netanyahu.)
If Obama decides to fight back and activate his doomsday weapon — the accusation that Israel puts the lives of American
servicemen at risk — this would have catastrophic consequences for Israel.
For the time being, this is only a shot across the bow — a warning shot fired by a warship in order to induce another
vessel to follow its instructions. The warning is clear. Even if the present crisis is somehow damped down, it will
inevitably flare up again and again as long as the present coalition in Israel stays in power.
When the movie "Hurt Locker" won its awards, the entire American public was united in its concern about the lives of its
soldiers in the Middle East. If this public becomes convinced that Israel is sticking a knife in their back, it will be a disaster
for Netanyahu. And not just for him.

UUP policing meeting with McGuinness breaks
down after three minutes
Latest row comes on eve of critical vote in Stormont assembly on transfer of justice powers from London to Belfast
• Henry McDonald, Ireland correspondent
• quardian.co.uk, Monday 8 March 2010 17.36 GMT
• Article history
A meeting between the Ulster Unionists and Northern Ireland's deputy first minister aimed at securing the party's support
for the devolution of policing and justice broke down in acrimony this evening.
The encounter between Martin McGuinness and a UUP delegation lasted all of three minutes at Stormont.
The latest row comes on the eve of a critical vote in the Stormont assembly on transferring justice and policing powers
from London to Belfast. The UUP has indicated it will not support the last act of devolution because they believe the entire
power-sharing executive is dysfunctional.
Sir Reg Empey, the UUP leader, told the Guardian last month his party would not support the transfer of these powers
unless it obtained concessions on education — specifically the retention of academic selection to grammar schools at 11.
Following the aborted meeting today, the UUP released a statement condemning both McGuinness and Peter Robinson,
the first minister, who is leader of the rival Democratic Unionist party. The UUP claimed it had been ejected from the
deputy first minister's office.
A UUP spokesman said: "An ill-tempered deputy first minister attempted to aggressively lecture the Ulster Unionist party
on policing and justice. He ridiculously accused us of being an anti-agreement party. Our delegation robustly reminded the
deputy first minister that we were the party which brought power-sharing government to Stormont.
"Quite clearly dissent and disagreement are unacceptable to Sinn Fein — unfortunately for Mr McGuinness, a party voting
against a motion with which it disagrees is basic, normal democratic politics."
The spokesman added that McGuinness's "angry and aggressive attempt to lecture" the UUP was "wholly unacceptable".
"When challenged on his tone, the meeting broke down. The UUP will not take lectures on our commitment to devolution
from Martin McGuinness.
"If this is how Sinn Fein understands power-sharing, then it is small wonder that the [Northern Ireland] executive is
dysfunctional."
If the DUP and Sinn Fein press ahead with the vote it is highly likely that the leader of the centrist, non-sectarian Alliance
party, David Ford, will become the first justice minister for Northern Ireland.
The SDLP will back the transfer of policing and justice powers in the Assembly tomorrow. However the nationalist party is
angry that it is not being offered the justice ministry. Under the rules governing the hand-out of ministries in the power-
sharing government the SDLP are officially entitled to choose the next ministry.
The party opposes the appointment of Ford as justice minister but will still support the transfer of these powers as they
want to be seen to continue to back the power-sharing arrangement.

David Cameron has been given a stark warning from Washington that dissident terrorists will be "emboldened" to intensify
their attacks in Northern Ireland and millions of dollars of US investment will be threatened if he fails to persuade the
Tories' Ulster Unionist partners to endorse the final stage of the peace process.
In a sign of deep unease in Washington at the Tories' electoral pact with the UUP, a bipartisan group of US Congress
members have demanded Cameron must "aggressively" encourage his partners to endorse the deal in a vote in the
Northern Ireland assembly on Tuesday.
"At this defining moment in the peace process, it is crucial that all the political parties speak with one voice about their
shared future," the members of Congress wrote in a private letter to Cameron.
Without a unanimous vote, they said, the province's elected officials would be sending the wrong message to the people
they represent, and to the world.
"Dissidents are trying to destabilise the political institutions and turn the clock back ... These dissidents will continue to be
emboldened if they sense there is no political unanimity on the way forward ... The challenge of bringing good jobs to
Northern Ireland will be made more difficult if potential investors do not believe there is political stability."
The letter by congressional leaders of the 41 million-strong Irish-American community has been passed to the Guardian
before the crucial vote on last month's Hillsborough agreement between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionists.
A yes vote would see policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month in what the British government
has dubbed the final piece in the jigsaw of the 1998 Good Friday agreement.
The congressmen and women, whose views reflect the private misgivings of the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton,
wrote to Cameron after learning that his electoral partners in Northern Ireland were voicing doubts about endorsing the
deal. Clinton is said to be alarmed that Cameron has either failed, or not bothered, to warn the UUP of the dangers of
obstructing the deal.
A Tory source said: "David Cameron has consistently made clear that we support the devolution of policing and criminal
justice powers ... We welcomed the agreement between the DUP and Sinn Fein. The final details are for the parties in the
executive, working as a four-party coalition, to decide. We hope that between now and Tuesday any outstanding issues
can be solved."
The Hillsborough agreement was brokered last month under a system endorsed by the UUP when it was the largest party
in Northern Ireland. This says that any change must have the consent of 50% of both the nationalist and Unionist
communities and 50% of the assembly.
Sir Reg Empey, the UUP leader who was one of the architects of the Good Friday agreement, will meet his party's
executive tomorrow night to decide how to vote.
The deal could still be passed tomorrow without the support of the UUP because the DUP's 36 assembly members
account for more than 50% of the unionist bloc. But there are fears in Washington that a no vote from the UUP, seen as a
moribund force until Cameron breathed new life into it, would destabilise many members of the DUP and undermine
support for the devolution of policing and criminal justice powers.
US eyes on Northern Ireland in countdown to
crucial peace vote
Hillary Clinton, the White House and Congressional leaders look for a yes vote in Belfast
By Nick Watt
Guardian
For a few hours tomorrow, the United States will turn its attention to Northern Ireland. Democratic and Republican leaders
will both be watching to see whether all mainstream political parties endorse the final stage in the implementation of the
Good Friday Agreement: the devolution of policing and criminal justice powers.
Sir Reg Empey, the leader of the Ulster Unionist party, is meeting his executive tonight to decide whether to vote yes.
Empey has severe doubts about the deal between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist party. This would see policing

and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month — a key nationalist demand — in return for the long-standing
unionist demand for a review of the way in which contentious parades are run.
Intense pressure is being placed on Empey to fall into line. Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state who has taken a keen
interest in Northern Ireland since the peace process was launched in the early days of her husband's presidency, spent
15 minutes talking to Empey by phone, according to BBC Northern Ireland.
But transatlantic pressure has also been brought to bear on the other side of the Irish Sea. I reported this morning that a
group of bipartisan US Congressmen have written to David Cameron asking him to use his influence with the UUP, which
recently formed an electoral pact with the Tories, to vote yes.
The unease among the US Congress members is shared by Hillary Clinton. She is said to believe that Cameron would be
well advised to follow the example of John Major, who was respected as an impartial referee.
The concerns in the US will raise questions about claims made in private recently by William Hague. The shadow foreign
secretary is saying that, despite their political differences, he is forging a strong bond with Clinton.
But all sides need to be careful. The Tories, who support the deal between Sinn Fein and the DUP, believe that ministers
need to be careful about frightening the UUP with too much political pressure. The government was this morning
trumpeting a poll, commissioned by them, which showed overwhelming support among UUP voters for a yes vote. But, as
Slugger O'Toole notes, there is some debate about the methodology.
"It almost feels like the government want the UUP to vote no so they can draw one of Gordon Brown's beloved dividing
lines and say we are to blame for it all going wrong," one Tory tells me.

George Bush to David Cameron: don't derail
Northern Ireland peace process
Exclusive: Former president urges Cameron to rein in Unionist partners

The former US president George Bush has made a direct plea to David Cameron to support the Northern Ireland peace
process, amid widespread concern in the US about the Tories' new electoral pact with the Ulster Unionists.
In his most active intervention since leaving the White House, Bush took the rare step of calling the Conservative leader to
ask him to use his influence to press his unionist partners to endorse the final stages of the 15-year search for a
settlement.
Bush, who took a close interest in the peace process during his years in the White House, telephoned Cameron last
Friday to ask him to plead with the UUP leader, Sir Reg Empey, to endorse the deal in a vote tomorrow in the Northern
Ireland assembly.
Democrats and Republicans fear that the peace process could be undermined if the Ulster Unionist party, formerly
Northern Ireland's largest party, which governed the province until direct rule was imposed in 1972, votes against the
devolution of policing and criminal justice powers to Belfast.
While the UUP does not have enough votes to scupper the deal, the White House fears a no vote from the UUP could
undermine support for the settlement within the Democratic Unionist party and among the wider unionist community.
Cameron has faced intense pressure in recent months over his decision to form an electoral pact with the UUP, which
could provide him with crucial support if the general election leads to a hung parliament. The pact has prompted fears in
Washington that Cameron may abandon the even-handed approach to Northern Ireland adopted by John Major in the
early years of the peace process.
The Guardian understands that the White House is so concerned that the US economic envoy to Northern Ireland, Declan
Kelly, persuaded Bush to intervene. The former president telephoned Cameron to ask him to use his influence to
persuade Empey to vote for the deal.
"There was a feeling that a conservative to conservative conversation was the right way to go about this," said one source
familiar with the transatlantic negotiations. "This conversation was borne out of the concern that Empey is holding out."
Another source familiar with the contact said: "This is the most active thing George W Bush has done in his post-
presidency period. He has been incredibly restrained and diplomatic since leaving the White House. He has maintained
radio silence."
One source familiar with thinking on Northern Ireland on both sides of the Atlantic added: "The fact that George W Bush
has decided to intervene is really significant. He was interested in the peace process as president and appointed an
envoy. It is a general sign of how concerned people are in the US about what David Cameron is up to."
A Tory source said: "George Bush did have a conversation with David Cameron. It was a positive conversation. David
underlined his commitment to the agreement and said we are doing all we can to support it. But he said that we cannot
force Sir Reg to vote for it. George Bush thanked David and said, 'I can see you are engaged."
The disclosure of Bush's intervention came as Empey met the executive of his party tonight to decide whether to endorse
the deal brokered last month at Hillsborough Castle between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionists that would see
policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month.

The UUP leader, who is minister for employment and learning in the four-party power sharing executive, believes it is
foolish to devolve the final set of powers while the coalition is struggling to function. In a sign of Empey's unease about
endorsing the deal, a meeting between the UUP and the Sinn Fein deputy first minster, Martin McGuinness, broke up
after just three minutes tonight.
The White House and political leaders across the spectrum in the US have been watching developments with care. Hillary
Clinton, the US secretary of state, today pleaded with Empey in a 15-minute telephone call to support the deal.
A group of US Congress members wrote to Cameron last month to issue a stark warning that dissident terrorists will be
"emboldened" to intensify their attacks if he fails to persuade the Tories' partners to endorse the final stage of the peace
process.

The Doomsday Weapon
IT IS already a commonplace to say that people who don't learn from history are
condemned to repeat their mistakes.
Some 1942 years ago, the Jews In the province called Palaestina launched a
revolt against the Roman Empire. In retrospect, this looks like an act of
madness. Palestine was a small and insignificant part of the world-wide empire
which had just won a crushing victory against the rival power - the Parthian
Empire (Persia) - and put down a major rebellion in Britain. What chances could
the Jewish revolt have?
God knows what was going on in the mind of the "Zealots". They eliminated the
Moderate leaders, who warned against provoking the empire, and gained sway over
the Jewish population of the country. They relied on God. Perhaps they also
relied on the Jews in Rome and believed that their influence over the Senate
would restrain the Emperor, Nero. Perhaps they had heard that Nero was weak and
about to fall.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768486 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768486 Date: 08/31/2015
We know how it ended: after three years, the rebels were crushed, Jerusalem fell
and the temple was burned down. The last of the Zealots committed suicide in
Masada.
The Zionists did indeed try to learn from history. They acted in a rational way,
did not provoke the great powers, endeavored in every situation to attain what
was possible. They accepted compromises, and every compromise served them as a
basis for the next surge forward. They cleverly utilized the radical stance of
their adversaries and gained the sympathy of the whole world.
But since the beginning of the occupation, their mind has become clouded. The
cult of Masada has become dominant. Divine promises once again start to play a
role in public discourse. Large parts of the public are following the new
zealots.
The next phase is also repeating itself: the leaders of Israel are starting a
rebellion against the new Rome.
WHAT BEGAN as an insult to the Vice President of the United States is developing
into something far bigger. The mouse has given birth to an elephant.
Lately, the ultra-right government in Jerusalem has started to treat President
Barack Obama with thinly veiled contempt. The fears that arose in Jerusalem at
the beginning of his term have dissipated. Obama looks to them like a paper
black panther. He gave up his demand for a real settlement freeze. Every time he
was spat on, he remarked that it was raining.
Yet now, ostensibly quite suddenly, the measure is full. Obama, his Vice
President and his senior assistants condemn the Netanyahu government with
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768486 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768486 Date: 08/31/2015
growing severity. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has submitted an ultimatum:
Netanyahu must stop all settlement activity, East Jerusalem included; he must
agree to negotiate about all core problems of the conflict, including East
Jerusalem, and more.
The surprise was complete. Obama, it seems, has crossed the Rubicon, much as the
Egyptian army had crossed the Suez Canal in 1973. Netanyahu gave the order to
mobilize all the reserves in America and to move forward all the diplomatic
tanks. All Jewish organizations in the US were commanded to join the campaign.
AIPAC blew the shofar and ordered its soldiers, the Senators and Congressmen, to
storm the White House.
It seems that the decisive battle has been joined. The Israeli leaders were
certain that Obama would be defeated.
And then an unusual noise was heard: the sound of the doomsday weapon.
THE MAN who decided to activate it was a foe of a new kind.
David Petraeus is the most popular officer of the United States army. The
four-star general, son of a Dutch sea captain who went to America when his
country was overrun by the Nazis, stood out from early childhood. In West Point
he was a "distinguished cadet", in Army Command and General Staff College he was
No. 1. As a combat commander, he reaped plaudits. He wrote his doctoral thesis
(on the lessons of Vietnam) at Princeton and served as an assistant professor
for international relations in the US Military Academy.
He made his mark in Iraq, when he commanded the forces in Mosul, the most
problematical city in the country. He concluded that in order to vanquish the
enemies of the US he Must win over the hearts of the civilian population,

acquire local allies and spend more money than ammunition. The locals called him
King David. His success was considered so outstanding that his methods were
adopted as the official doctrine of the American army.
His star rose rapidly. He was appointed commander of the coalition forces in
Iraq and soon became the chief of the Central Command of the US army, which
covers the whole Middle East , except Israel and Palestine (which "belong" to
the American command in Europe).
When such a person raises his voice, the American people listen. As a respected
military thinker, he has no rivals.
THIS WEEK, Petraeus conveyed an unequivocal message: after reviewing the
problems in his AOR (Area Of Responsibility) - which includes, among others,
Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq and Yemen - he turned to what he called the
"root causes of instability" in the region. The list was topped by the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
In his report to the Armed Services Committee he stated: "The enduring
hostilities between Israel and some of its neighbors present distinct challenges
to our ability to advance our interests in the AOR_The conflict foments
anti-American sentiment, due to a perception of U.S. favoritism for Israel. Arab
anger over the Palestinian Question limits the strength and depth of U.S.
partnerships with governments and peoples in the AOR and weakens the legitimacy
of moderate regimes in the Arab world. Meanwhile, al-Qaeda and, other militant
groups exploit that anger to mobilize support. The conflict also gives Iran
influence in the Arab world through its clients, Lebanese Hizballah and Hamas."
Not content with that, Petraeus sent his officers to present his conclusions to
the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768486 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768486 Date: 08/31/2015
In other words: Israeli-Palestinian peace is not a private matter between the
two parties, but a supreme national interest of the USA. That means that the US
must give up its one-sided support for the Israeli government and impose the
two-state solution.
The argument as such is not new. Several experts have said more or less the same
in the past. (Immediately after the 9/11 attacks, I wrote in a similar vein and
prophesied that the US would change its policy. It did not happen then.) But now
this is being stated in an official document written by the responsible American
commander.
The Netanyahu government immediately went into damage-limitation mode. Its
spokespersons declared that Petraeus represents a narrow military approach, that
he doesn't understand political matters, that his reasoning is faulty. But it is
not this that made people in Jerusalem break out into cold sweat.
AS IS well known, the pro-Israel lobby dominates the American political system
without limits - almost. Every American politician and senior official is
mortally afraid of it. The slightest deviation from the strict AIPAC line is
tantamount to political suicide.
But in the armor of this political Goliath there is a chink. Like Achilles'
heel, the immense might of the pro-Israel lobby has a vulnerable point that,
when touched, can neutralize its power.
It was illustrated by the Jonathan Pollard affair. This American-Jewish employee
of a sensitive intelligence agency spied
. for Israel. Israelis consider him a
national hero, a Jew who did his duty to his people. But for the US intelligence
community, he is a traitor who endangered the lives of many American agents. Not

satisfied with a routine penalty, it induced the court to impose a life
sentence. Since then, all American presidents have refused the requests of
successive Israeli governments to commute the sentence. No president dared to
confront his intelligence chiefs in this matter.
But the most significant side of this affair is reminiscent of the famous words
of Sherlock Holmes about the dogs that did not bark. AIPAC did not bark. The
entire American Jewish community fell silent. Almost nobody raised their voice
for poor Pollard.
Why? Because most American Jews are ready to do anything - just anything - for
the government of Israel. With one exteption: they will not do anything that
appears to hurt the security of the United States. When the flag of security is
hoisted, the Jews, like all Americans, snap to attention and salute. The
Damocles sword of suspicion of disloyalty hangs above their heads. For them,
this is the ultimate nightmare: to be accused of putting the security of Israel
ahead of the security of the US. Therefore it is important for them to repeat
endlessly the mantra that the interests of Israel and the US are identical.
And now comes the most important general of the US Army and says that this is
not so. The policy of the present Israeli government is endangering the lives of
American soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan.
FOR NOW, this is being said only as a side remark, in a military document that
has not been widely aired. But the sword has been drawn from its scabbard - and
,American Jews have started to tremble at the distant rumble of an approaching
earthquake.
This week, Netanyahu's brother-in-law has used our own doomsday weapon. He
declared that Obama is an "anti-Semite". The official newspaper of the Shas
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768486 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768486 Date: 08/31/2015
party has asserted that Obama is really a Muslim. They represent the radical
right and its allies, who argue in speech and in writing that "Hussein" Obama is
a.Jew-hating black who must be beaten in the coming congressional elections and
in the next presidential ones.
(Yet an important poll in Israel published yesterday shows that the Israeli
public is far from convinced by these insinuations: the vast majority believes
that Obama's treatment of Israel is fair. Indeed, Obama got higher marks than
Netanyahu.)
If Obama decides to fight back and activate his doomsday weapon - the accusation
that Israel puts the lives of American servicemen at risk - this would have
catastrophic consequences for Israel.
For the time being, this is only a shot across the bow - a warning shot fired by
a warship in order to induce another vessel to follow its instructions. The
warning is clear. Even if the present crisis is somehow damped down, it will
inevitably flare up again and again as long as the present coalition in Israel
stays in power.
When the movie "Hurt Locker" won its awards, the entire American public was
united in its concern about the lives of its soldiers in the Middle East. If
this public becomes convinced that Israel is sticking a knife in their back, it
will be a disaster for Netanyahu. And not just for him.

Re: AIPAC speech
This memo does not address specific policy initiatives.
What I've written are options. Use what you like, or none at all. Here are some ideas:
1. Hold Bibi's feet to the fire, remind everyone he was at Wye, his key participant event in
the peace process, and that it was successful.
2. Reassure all players of our commitment to the process and the solution (whatever the
language is).
3. Perhaps most controversial, I would argue something you should do is that, while
praising AIPAC, remind it in as subtle but also direct a way as you can that it does not
have a monopoly over American Jewish opinion. Bibi is stage managing US Jewish
organizations (and neocons, and the religious right, and whomever else he can muster)
against the administration. AIPAC itself has become an organ of the Israeli right,
specifically Likud. By acknowledging J Street you give them legitimacy, credibility and
create room within the American Jewish community for debate supportive of the
administration's pursuit of the peace process. Just by mentioning J Street in passing,
AIPAC becomes a point on the spectrum, not the controller of the spectrum. I suggest a
way how to do this below.
Some language:
1. On US national security interest, Israel's security and the peace process:
The reason the US has always supported Israel since the moment President Harry S. Truman
decided to recognize the State of Israel is that it is in the US national security interest and
consistent with our values. It is in our interest to support a thriving democracy in the Middle East

Only through the marketplace of ideas will sound policies to help resolve complicated and
seemingly intransigent problems be developed. This administration values everybody's views.
They are important. You are important. We welcome views across the spectrum, from AIPAC to
J Street. All these views are legitimate and must be heard and considered.

Time to break the fog of Middle East politics
By David Ignatius
Sunday, March 21, 2010; A19
Diplomats love ambiguity. It allows them to fuzz up the hard parts of a negotiation -- the "final status" issues, as they're
often called -- and save them for later, when the parties are more amenable to pressure.
This devotion to "constructive ambiguity" has been a hallmark of U.S. peacemaking on the Palestinian-Israeli issue for 40
years. Rather than state the unpalatable concessions that most analysts recognize will be required for any viable
settlement -- that Israelis must share sovereignty in Jerusalem and that Palestinians must give up the "right of return" to
Israel -- successive U.S. administrations have tried to defer these unmentionables until later.
But the fog machine blew apart this month, when the isr3e1Interipr i‘,1!inista_rndLinced du

erp. The Obama administration was upset, to put it
mildly: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called the housing announcement a "deeply negative signal" about U.S.-Israeli
relations and "an insult."
In the ensuing hubbub over the "crisis" in U.S.-Israeli relations, there have been frantic attempts to pretend it was all a
misunderstanding and pull the cloak of ambiguity back over the peace process. But that's a mistake.
The East Jerusalem move wasn't an accident but an emphatic public statement of the Israeli right's rejection of
concessions on Jerusalem. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu had been trying to play along with U.S. requests to fuzz
the issue by avoiding provocative actions on Jerusalem. But the right-wing Shas party, which controls the Interior Ministry,
basically called his bluff.
"Freezing building in East Jerusalem is one of those things we cannot do," said Dore Gold, a right-wing former Israeli
ambassador to the United Nations. And Avigdor Lieberman, the Israeli foreign minister and a settler himself, responded:
"Can you imagine if they told Jews in New York they could not build or buy in Queens?"
So what should the administration do, now that the Israeli right has put Jerusalem squarely on the table despite the best
efforts of the ambiguity-addicted diplomats?
The administration's best strategy is to do what it considered a year ago, which is to state clearly the basic principles that
must frame these negotiations. Those guidelines have been articulated well by Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former national
security adviser: real sharing of Jerusalem; no right of return for the Palestinians; a return to the 1967 borders, with mutual
adjustments to allow for big Israeli settlement blocks; and a demilitarized Palestinian state. Every negotiation for the past
four decades has converged toward those parameters.
The Obama administration debated whether to issue such a statement of principles a year ago, when it began its
peacemaking effort. Launching negotiations with this "big bang" made sense to some officials, including Gen. Jim Jones,
the national security adviser, But George Mitchell, the Middle East envoy, argued that based on his experience in the
Northern Ireland peace talks, it was better to let the parties haggle before the United States stepped in with bridging
proposals.
Rather than stating U.S. negotiating principles at the outset, the Obama team decided instead to push Netanyahu on
settlements. The administration picked this fight in the flush of President Obama's first months in office, confident that he

was so strong and Netanyahu so weak that if it came to a showdown, Netanyahu would cave. The Israeli leader coolly
bided his time, dickering about procedural issues while Obama got weaker politically by the month. Netanyahu finally
agreed in November to a temporary moratorium on new settlements -- but it excluded Jerusalem. The administration
should have seen what was coming.
In retrospect, it seems clear that the step-by-step approach was a mistake: Constructive ambiguity, in this case, proved
destructive. It allowed the Israeli right wing to perpetuate the idea that it could have it all -- obtain a peace deal without
making concessions on Jerusalem. And it allowed Netanyahu to continue his straddle.
Jerusalem is the hardest issue of all in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiation, and for that reason, would-be peacemakers
have wanted to save it for last. But this month's crisis makes that strategic waffling impossible. Thanks to the Israeli right,
the Jerusalem issue is joined.
What's needed now is for Obama to announce that when negotiations begin, the United States will state its views about
Jerusalem and other key issues -- sketching the outlines of the deal that most Israelis and Palestinians want. If Netanyahu
refuses to play, then we have a real crisis in U.S.-Israeli relations.

UUP rejects Tory plea and votes against
devolution of policing powers
New justice ministry is created without backing of Conservative allies in Stormont

The final part of the Northern Ireland devolution deal was put in place today, giving the province its first justice minister
since the Troubles erupted four decades ago.
Nationalists and unionists in the Stormont parliament voted together to create the new justice ministry, completing the last
act of the Good Friday agreement.
But there was discord inside the Stormont parliament after the Conservatives' allies in Northern Ireland, the Ulster
Unionists, and their 18-strong assembly team, voted against the move.
Despite an 11th hour intervention by David Cameron imploring the UUP to vote yes, the party refused to back the historic
measure.
The party's stance puts Cameron in a difficult position: he is in favour of the devolution of justice to Belfast, but his
electoral pact with the UUP risks exposing him to criticism that a Conservative government could not claim to be an
"honest broker" when there are disagreements between the parties at Stormont.
Today's vote came just before 5pm, when 88 assembly members from Sinn Fein and the DUP joined the SDLP and
smaller parties to back the transfer of policing and judicial powers to Belfast.
But the UUP resisted pressure — from, among others, former US president George Bush — to support the measure.
Speaking on the assembly floor, Sir Reg Empey, the UUP leader, said his party had voted no "as a democratic political

party pledged to making power-sharing work in an inclusive manner for all the people of Northern Ireland, and we exercise
our rights refusing to bow to the blackmail and bullying to which we have been subjected in recent weeks."
The deputy first minister, Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness, earlier denounced the UUP stance, claiming it was intended to
embarrass the DUP.
"The UUP declared last night that they will not support this resolution," McGuinness told the assembly.
"That saddens and disappoints me. They are opposed in my view to the transfer for cynical party political reasons."
In a statement after the vote, Gordon Brown praised the parties which backed the deal. "Today the politics of progress
have finally replaced the politics of division in Northern Ireland," the prime minister said. "The completion of devolution,
supported by all sections of the community in Northern Ireland, is the final end to decades of strife. It sends the most
powerful message to those who would return to violence: that democracy and tolerance will prevail.
"The courage and leadership of the parties who voted to complete devolution at Stormont will be noted around the world."
The Conservatives welcomed the vote, without mentioning the UUP's rejection of the move. A Tory spokesman said: "We
welcome the fact that devolution of policing and justice is going to happen. We wanted all four parties to be involved and
for it to be decided by local politicians."
But the Liberal Democrats called on Cameron to "clarify the position of his Tory-UUP alliance on the devolution of policing
and justice powers".
Alistair Carmichael, their spokesman on Northern Ireland, said: "With the UUP saying one thing, and the Tories saying the
complete opposite, voters will struggle to understand what exactly joint Tory-UUP candidates stand for. What we're seeing
is the Tories in complete disarray. When it takes George Bush to step in as the voice of reason, it's clear that David
Cameron has dug himself a very big hole."
Carmichael added: "This raises serious questions about David Cameron's judgment. If he can't manage to steer a straight
course in opposition, how on earth would he cope as prime minister?"
Earlier there was acrimony in the Great Hall at Stormont when a victims' campaigner attempted to serve a civil writ against
McGuinness.
Willie Frazer of the group Families Acting for Innocent Relatives threw the legal document in McGuinness's direction after
the deputy first minister refused to take it off him. Frazer is taking a civil action in Belfast high court against the Sinn Fein
MP because he alleges McGuinness directed the IRA's campaign during the Troubles. The south Armagh unionist's father
was shot dead by the IRA.
The FAIR spokesman said he had chosen yesterday because the DUP "had betrayed me and other victims" by agreeing
to devolve policing and justice powers. Frazer predicted that Sinn Fein would exercise a major influence over the police
and judiciary even though the centrist, non-sectarian Alliance party leader, David Ford, will be the first justice minister.
Frazer said: "I am very disappointed in the DUP because for years they said the things victims wanted to hear and now
they have done a complete somersault. All along they told me that Sinn Fein would never get their hands on policing and
justice but they have a say. Mr Ford is answerable to the executive and that means the deputy first minister, Martin
McGuinness. That is why the only action left to me is a civil action. I feel very let down by a number of DUP people."
The DUP will suffer at the polls for this U-turn, Frazer predicted.

Courage and Consequence: Less Memoir Than
Hoax
Karl Rove's book Courage and Consequence is less memoir than hoax. The chapters that relate to the CIA leak scandal
are yet another attempt to deflect attention from his central role in the betrayal of Valerie Plame Wilson's identity as a
covert CIA officer.
His distortions and fabrications are consistent with his approach throughout this sordid and criminal affair. Wasting his
opportunity to tell the truth, he offers absolutely nothing new, and his selective use of facts and quotes are a transparent
effort to continue his long campaign to confuse people, unfortunately consistent with his past behavior.
His book is a pathetically weak defense of the disastrous policies pursued by the Bush administration, involving our
country in a war of choice based on false intelligence and badly tarnishing the good name of the United States of America.
Nothing in Karl Rove's book refutes those facts. His book, however, is illuminating in further exposing his political
methods, especially his reliance on personal insults, not simply towards Valerie and myself, but also towards all those
who opposed his unprincipled behavior.
If any additional proof to the irrefutable historical record were needed, Rove's book demonstrates once again the actions
of a vindictive, angry and petty man. Karl Rove betrayed his nation; now he has betrayed history.

Stormont votes to take over Northern Ireland
policing powers
•Power-sharing finalised as assembly agrees to first justice minister since Troubles
•Ulster Unionists oppose measure but Hillary Clinton welcomes assembly's yes vote
A 15-year search for a political settlement in Northern Ireland cleared its final hurdle today when unionists and nationalists
voted to transfer policing and criminal justice powers to Belfast, creating the province's first justice minister since the
Troubles erupted four decades ago.
Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP), who were barely on speaking terms a few years ago, joined forces
with the nationalist SDLP in the Northern Ireland assembly to endorse a deal on policing, hammered out last month.
The justice minister will be appointed on 12 April and is likely to be David Ford, the leader of the centrist Alliance party.
The breakthrough was marred by a row when the Ulster Unionist party (UUP), which governed Northern Ireland for five
decades until the imposition of direct rule in 1972, voted against the deal.
Sir Reg Empey, the UUP leader, who recently formed an electoral pact with the Conservatives, said he had voted no
because his party did not believe that the four-party power-sharing executive was functioning properly. Empey, the
minister for employment and learning, said: "We exercise our rights, refusing to bow to the blackmail and bullying to which
we have been subjected in recent weeks."
The UUP hit out after facing intense pressure from London and the US to fall in behind David Cameron, who has backed
devolution of the criminal justice system. Gordon Brown phoned Empey shortly before today's vote, while former US
president George Bush pleaded with Cameron last week to persuade the UUP to support the deal.
Empey's unionist rivals, the DUP, who have overtaken the UUP in recent years, focused on what could happen after the
vote. The DUP leader, Peter Robinson, who managed to persuade all but one of his 36 assembly members to back the
devolution deal, said: "The move is about completing and maintaining devolution, it is about whether we move forward
together as a society."
The vote secures an extra £800m for policing and justice that Brown promised the assembly if they backed the transfer. It
also adds an extra 1,200 police officers. The prime minister praised the main parties for reaching the deal on an issue that
almost broke the power-sharing government.
He said: "Today the politics of progress have finally replaced the politics of division in Northern Ireland. The completion of
devolution, supported by all sections of the community in Northern Ireland, is the final end to decades of strife. It sends
the most powerful message to those who would return to violence: that democracy and tolerance will prevail. The courage
and leadership of the parties who voted to complete devolution at Stormont will be noted around the world."

The vote was also praised tonight by Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state. She
said: "I commend the Northern Ireland Assembly for its affirmation of the
Hillsborough Agreement and its endorsement of the devolution of policing and
justice, an important step in ensuring a peaceful and prosperous future for all of the
people of Northern Ireland for generations to come."
Irish president Mary McAleese also hailed the move. "Today's vote in the Northern Ireland assembly represents an
eloquent statement of confidence in the political institutions established under the Good Friday Agreement," she said.
Matt Baggott, chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, welcomed the vote as a step forward. "Devolution
will strengthen our service. It will help to ensure communities receive the policing service that not only they deserve, but
that we are committed to delivering.
"The financial package is also welcomed ... it will help us deal with those who are living in the darkness of the past and
who have tried to disrupt this process and the lives of our community."
But there was discord inside Stormont after the UUP and their 17-strong assembly team voted against the move.
Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein's deputy first minister, denounced the UUP stance, claiming they were doing it to
embarrass the DUP. "The UUP declared last night [Monday] that they will not support this resolution," McGuinness told
the assembly. "That saddens and disappoints me. They are opposed in my view to the transfer for cynical party political
reasons." He stressed that no single party could control the justice department.
The UUP no-vote will put pressure on the Tories, who will campaign with their allies in the general election, having taken
opposing sides on the biggest vote since the DUP and Sinn Fein started sharing power in 2007.
Cameron insisted that the Tories had played a constructive role, saying he would maintain his alliance with the UUP. "We
want to move Northern Ireland politics forward — to focus on the issues that affect people in their everyday lives — rather
than remaining stuck in the past. That is why we remain totally committed to bringing national, mainstream UK politics to
Northern Ireland and to ending its semi-detached political status."
Cameron's remarks were designed, in part, to reassure the White House, which fears a UUP no-vote could harden
unionist opinion against power-sharing.
Hardline Unionists turned on the DUP tonight. Jim Allister, the former DUP MEP, who now leads the breakaway
Traditional Unionist Voice, claimed his former party had "rolled over in triple somersaults for Sinn Fein". He also
suggested the new justice minister would be a "pointless puppet keeping the seat warm for Sinn Fein". Prior to the vote
the widow of the first Police Service of Northern Ireland officer to be murdered by dissident republicans urged all parties to
back the devolution of policing and justice powers. Kate Carroll, whose husband, Stephen, was killed by a Continuity IRA
sniper, said in an appeal to the UUP: "It is heartbreaking that I have to get on this morning to please ask the politicians to
get on with their job."

Setup for foreign policy TV debate on Thursday. Obviously, this is a popular position. Clegg is now at the height of his
popularity and playing to public opinion. Clegg is pushing off both Brown (still suffering from Obama's dismissive slights,
unpopularity of Afghanistan, and, deepest factor, Bush poisoning of the well) and Cameron (making him an old
Thatcherite, pro-US, anti-EU). Clegg is an ardent Europeanist, not so much Americanist.

Clegg: special relationship with US is over
Tue Apr 20 2010 20:38:43
ctThe "special relationship" between Britain and the United States is over, Nick Clegg has said.
The Liberal Democrat leader said Barack Obama's administration "understood the world had changed" and the UK's
leaders needed to end their "slavish" devotion to Washington.
Mr Clegg also warned against "sabre-rattling" over Iran's nuclear ambitions and repeated his pledge to offer a referendum
on the UK's continued membership of the European Union when the issue next arose.
The Lib Dems have ruled out replacing Trident with a like-for-like system and Mr Clegg said the UK should consider "not
having a continuous at sea deterrent".
In a speech to the Foreign Press Association in London, Mr Clegg said it was time to challenge the "conventional wisdom"
that had lasted since the Suez crisis about the UK's relationship with the US.
He said: "I think it's sometimes rather embarrassing the way Conservative and Labour politicians talk in this kind of slavish
way about the special relationship. If you speak to hard-nosed folk in Washington they think 'it's a good relationship but it's
not the special relationship'."

Re: US Jewish and Israeli public opinion
Three new polls released: from Avaaz (all US), j Street (US Jews), and Ha'aretz (Israelis). I've sent Lauren the
whole J Street poli to print out for you; its internals are the most detailed, relevant and suggestive. My reading
of that .poll is that the administration is in a pretty good spot with US Jewish opinion and that the drag (about 10
points, I think) has less to do with the Middle East and Israel than with the economy. Jewish opinion is far more
solidly supportive of the administration generally than the general population (except minorities). Those
adamantly opposed to the administration stance on Israel are preconceived to be against; they are predictable, a
minority of the US Jewish community and have reached their natural limits. The institutional US Jewish
position backing Bibi and against the administration does not have majority support among Jews.
Avaaz.org (a left international environmental activist group involved with Al Gore on climate change)
commissioned a YouGov poll (more info here: http://bitly/9T4heA) of the general American public that found:
• 62% of those polled said the growth of Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territory will only lead
to greater hostilities.
• 52% of respondents support, and 31% oppose, the Obama administration's demand that Israel stop all
settlement-building.
• The poll showed broad support for President Obama's overall approach to the region. 61% of
respondents supported the administration's plan to lead negotiations to broker a peace deal between
Israel and the Palestinians during the coming months, with only 25% opposing that approach.
J Street found:
• American Jews by a four-to-one margin, 82-18 percent, support the United States playing an active role
in helping the parties to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict, with 73 percent of American Jews supporting
this active role even if it means that the United States were to publicly state its disagreements with both
the Israelis and the Arabs.

fyi, drug violence, cuidad juarez and women. Sid
FYI, a lot of the violence in Cuidad Juarez has historically been targeted against women. In 2002, Max wrote this report
from Juarez, the first report by an American from the scene, winning the Annenberg Online Journalism Award, the
equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize.

Day of the dead
More than 325 women have been murdered in the free-trade boomtown of Ciudad Juarez in the past decade. Faced with
government incompetence and corruption, people are rebelling.
By Max Blumenthal
Dec 4, 2002 I The body of another murdered woman was found late last month in the Mexican industrial hub of Ciudad
Juarez, dumped behind some shrubs in the squalor of the Anapra neighborhood, a ramshackle hodgepodge of corrugated
tin and cardboard shacks on the sludge-washed banks of the Rio Grande. Her hands had been tied, and the evidence
suggested she had been raped. The body was so badly decomposed that investigators calculated that she'd been dead
for seven months.
However horrific the details, they were numbing in their familiarity. The body of a woman who had died in similar
circumstances was found in the same dusty lot a couple of months earlier. The bodies of eight women were found in a lot
not far away a little more than a year ago. So many women have been murdered here in the past 10 years that there is no
reliable count. Most experts place it close to 325, an average of 32 a year, nearly three every month. At least 90 of the
deaths are believed to be the work of one or more serial killers. Hundreds more women have simply vanished.
Like so many of the others, the woman whose body was found in late October had probably come to Juarez from the
poverty of southern Mexico to work for about $10 a day in one of the many foreign-owned assembly plants known as
maquiladoras that sprouted up in Juarez after the North American Free Trade Agreement was signed in 1994. And like
them, too, her body was unclaimed in death and buried alone and anonymous.
Such death has become a way of life here. So, too, with the fear and paranoia that rise in such a climate. Nobody knows
who is doing the killings, and the mystery only seems to deepen. Arrests made by local authorities have produced
allegations of torture, witness tampering and frame-ups -- but no convictions. Most here believe that the killer or killers
must have enormous clout. Perhaps, some say, the killers are narcotrafficantes disposing of witnesses. Perhaps they are
the sons of the wealthy and powerful indulging in sick sex. Perhaps they are cultists whose members come from the
highest levels of government and finance. The theories differ, but a common assumption is that arrests made thus far are
only a smokescreen for an historically opaque and corrupt government that will protect its dark secrets at any cost.
One thing seems clear: The murders arise from a social landscape that has been transformed by global economic forces.
Where Ciudad Juarez was once a small, sleepy desert outpost just across the border from El Paso, Texas, the population
in the past decade has exploded to 1.2 million people, many of them drawn by the lure of the maquiladoras. The tides of
people have overwhelmed the ability of the city to absorb them, overwhelmed health services, social services and law
enforcement. Free-trade advocates once promised that NAFTA would transform Juarez into the City of the Future -- and

they have been proven right in a way they never could have imagined. Today, Juarez still has the feel of the lawless Old
West, but with a grim 21st century edge.
Despite promises of swift justice from Mexican President Vicente Fox and Chihuahua Gov. Patricio Martinez, they have
yet to take up offers of assistance from the FBI; bureau agents in Texas have suggested that official corruption is
hindering efforts to stop the murders. Chihuahua state investigators have seemingly adopted a "don't ask, don't tell" policy
towards Juarez's homicides, fostering an atmosphere of impunity and pervasive fear. Foreign corporations operating in
Juarez that have employed many of the murdered women largely deny that such an atmosphere exists.
But in this postmodern urban culture, where the very concept of community has broken down, many bereaved family
members and local activists have begun to take matters into their own hands, investigating the murders and speaking out
even if it means threats and other reprisals.
Evangeline Arce's daughter, Silvia, a street vendor, disappeared on Nov. 3, 1998. Since that day, she said, the authorities
have done little to investigate. "Two days after my daughter disappeared, I went to the police and filed a report," the
mother says in Spanish, her face flaring with anger. "They promised me prompt action but when I checked back a week
later, the Missing persons report was never filed and the investigation had not even begun. When they finally got
witnesses together, none of them would talk because they were too afraid."
Even as Mexico continues to make strides toward becoming an open and democratic society, the epidemic of rape and
murder here has exposed the heavy residue of its corrupt and authoritarian political legacy as well as the contradictions of
its efforts at economic expansion.
To understand the magnitude of the breakdown, think of the sniper rampage in the Washington area this fall that left 10
people dead and three wounded. Imagine that Montgomery County Police Chief Charles Moose held a press conference
and asked local citizens to catch the sniper themselves because local police were not up to the task and the federal
government was not being helpful; imagine that the federal government charged that local officials in Montgomery County
were complicit in the killings and impeding the investigation. Chaos would ensue, certainly. But then, multiply. the number
of victims by 30, by 40, by 50, or more.
That's Juarez today.
The jumbled, exhaust-choked commercial core of this city has grown wildly in the wake of NAFTA, adding modern
shopping malls, condominiums and expansive boulevards. The population is growing at twice the rate of the national
average; it is expected to nearly double by 2010, to 2 million people. Many of them directly or indirectly rely on the 300 or
so maquiladoras for their livelihoods.
To accommodate the new army of workers, the city has given birth to entirely new sectors. The Campestre Juarez is a
luxurious conglomerate of gated communities, with a main gate that's a life-size replica of Paris' Arc de Triomphe. Nearby,
many of the maquiladoras are situated along the Avenida de la Industria. Though the assembly-line workers sometimes
can be glimpsed behind a plate glass window in aqua-blue uniforms, there usually is little sign of any activity behind the
maquiladoras' featureless walls.
Most of the new residents are poor, or on the brink of poverty, and they live in Anapra or another of the grim, violent
colonias populares on the outskirts of town. In those colonies, residents usually live without sanitation, running water,
electricity or paved roads.
Avenida Manuel Gomez Morin is the pothole-riddled six-lane avenue that ties these varied worlds together. Sitio Colosio
Valle, a medium-sized strip mall, stands on a corner of the avenue at the gateway to the industrial sector. It is fronted by a
vast parking lot and inside are various clothing outlets and boutiques. By day, the lot bustles as customers scurry back
and forth, hauling their purchases to their cars -- a sight similar to any mall in the suburban United States. By night,
however, traffic tapers off, stores lock up and the mall's lot becomes dark and desolate. Sitio Colosio Valle was where
many of the slain and missing women were last seen.
In the mall's parking lot, Braulio Rosas, a 40-year-old security guard, leans against the door of a giant Nike outlet. Inside
the store, under bright fluorescent lights, employees frantically check inventory and scramble to close up.
"A lot of girls were picked up here," Roses says in a voice of calm resignation. "But really, it's the girls' fault. It's because
even though they weren't putas, [prostitutes] you know, they were more like fad/es [easy women]. They didn't have to get
into those cars if they didn't want to."
Rosas sounds cynical, but blaming the victims is by no means an aberration in Juarez. Similar notions have been offered
by officials like Suly Ponce, the former Chihuahua special prosecutor in charge of the murdered women's cases.
"Sometimes there are cases that a girl meets some person, he strikes up a relationship with her, they drink ... and it ends
violently," she told the Washington Post in 2000, before she was promoted to a job in the governor's office. "It's difficult to
know."
A handful of the women found murdered since 1993 were indeed confirmed as prostitutes. But the truth is that a large
majority of the missing or murdered women were hardworking, young, poor and for the most part socially conservative.
Most had migrated to Juarez from Mexico's depressed south to work in the maquiladoras, sometimes arriving alone and
with little means of contacting their families back home.
The maquiladoras, run by companies like Delphi and RCA Thomson, prefer to hire young women for assembly-line jobs.
An entry-level assembly-line worker makes minimum wage, about $2 an hour. With experience, pay can rise to as much
as $2,50 an hour -- and compared to wages in Guerrero or Chiapas, that's good money. But in Juarez, the women are
caught in an economic trap: Since the cost of living here is only slighter lower than in El Paso, the wages that seem so

high to new maquiladora workers actually ensure poverty. The workers can be hired and fired on the spot, with little
pretext and no legal protection. And union activities are prohibited.
Even for those who accept the conditions, security is elusive. More often now, the global companies that own
maquiladoras are closing up shop and transferring operations to China to take advantage of lower taxes, investment
subsidies and outrageously cheap labor. On June 29, Royal Philips Electronics announced it was moving its P.C. monitor
manufacturing operations, at a cost of 900 jobs. On July 1, Scientific Atlanta fired 1,300 workers after shutting its plant
down. According to the Nov. 5 New York Times, this trend has cost Juarez 287,000 jobs in the maquiladoras since their
peak in October 2000.
Not only does this slash and burn the economic base. There are brutal social reverberations, too. The city's health
system, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, has reported 200,000 people falling from its list of insured after losing their
company policies, according to a July article in La Prensa. Esther Chavez Cano, director of Juarez's only battered-
women's shelter, Casa Amiga, said in a speech this summer that domestic violence cases had risen by 50 percent in July
alone.
The combination of poverty and a lack of social connections renders women on the assembly line powerless and virtually
invisible. And that has made them easy prey. According to the El Paso Times, about a third of the approximately 325 slain
women were employed by maquiladoras at the time of their murder.
Given that few of the maquiladoras provide shuttle service to and from the colonies, the female workers often are preyed
upon while walking through perilous places like Sitio Colosio Valle in the darkness of the early morning. At such an hour,
the only nearby activity is that of bars and nightclubs closing up as male patrons filter into the street after a long night of
drinking.
Besides China's attractive economic climate, an intangible cause of maquiladora flight is Juarez's chronic violence. The
effect is difficult to measure. Two companies in the city's industrial sector -- including TDK, the audio tape maker -- have
posted banners on their factories reading: "STOP THE VIOLENCE. To Better Our City, Let's Unite." But most foreign
companies are purely economic organisms governed entirely, it seems, by the dictates of efficiency. They have
maintained a stunning silence even as their female workers are slaughtered.
Consider the case of 17-year-old Claudia !vette Gonzalez. Her body was found in November 2001 along with seven
others in an overgrown cotton field on Avenida Technologico, just blocks from Sitio Colosio Valle mall and across the
street from the offices of the Association of Maquiladoras. She had worked on the assembly line for the Lear Corp., a
Detroit-based auto-interior supplier. Lear has declined to publicly address Gonzalez's murder.
Greg Bloom, editor of the Frontera Norte Sur -- an Internet news service that focuses on the U.S.-Mexico border --
recalled a conversation with Gonzalez's mother, Josefina, in which she recounted her daughter's last day. In the darkness
of the early morning, Gonzalez told him, Claudia set out for her job at Lear. When she arrived at work a few minutes late
after missing her bus, Claudia lvette was promptly sent away under a policy barring tardy assembly-line workers from their
shifts. A half-hour past when she usually would have returned home, her mother knew something was gravely wrong. Her
worst fear -- the same nagging fear shared by so many Juarez mothers -- would soon be realized.
Andrea Puchalsky, Lear's director of communications, acknowledged that the company has not made any public
statements regarding Gonzalez's murder, nor has it enacted any proactive measures to protect employees from another
wave of violence. "Adding security is not a question that relates to Lear," she said. "[Gonzalez's murder] did not happen
on Lear property."
When questioned about the murder and Lear policies, Puchalsky mentioned that a company memo was prepared for her
with responses to possible questions. As to Lear's worker-lockout policy, which apparently put Gonzalez in a precarious
situation the day of her abduction, Puchalsky declined to comment on whether Gonzalez was locked out or sent home
from Lear's plant on her last day.
"We have a policy for tardiness and she was tardy many times," Puchalsky said. "When she had arrived late to work her
shift, she was not there in time to work her shift."
When asked whether Lear's offices in the U.S. have a similar policy in which late employees are barred from working their
shifts, Puchalsky reversed her earlier statement, vehemently denying that such a policy existed anywhere within Lear's
operations. "There is not a policy to send a worker home after X number of tardy arrivals," she said. "Typically what we do

The body of 17-year-old Lilia Alejandra Garcia was found mutilated just 300 feet from her maquiladora in February 2001,
and since then her case has come to embody the incompetence and corruption of police and prosecutors from Ciudad
Juarez to the state capital in Chihuahua City and south all the way to Mexico City.
Garcia, the mother of a 5-month-old baby and a 2-year-old child, apparently was kidnapped just after she left work. She
was held in captivity for a week, repeatedly beaten and raped, and then strangled. Then-prosecutor Suly Ponce told the
Juarez newspaper El Diario that Garcia was the first woman of the year to be murdered and raped in this area of the city -
- even though two days before, the body of an unidentified woman was found naked just blocks away.
When an FBI leak revealed witness testimony linking Lilia Garcia's killers to drug dealers, Suly Ponce dismissed it, calling
it erroneous. She instead blamed workers in a circus across the street from the strip mall where Garcia was last seen.
When circus managers claimed that Ponce offered them money to blame co-workers, she dropped the investigation.

According to a July article in the El Paso Times, former Chihuahua state forensic chief Oscar Maynez Grijalva said Garcia
was killed in a similar manner as three of the eight women found in the cotton field with Claudia 'vette Gonzalez in
November 2001. Curiously, local authorities behaved just as evasively in that investigation as in Garcia's.
When Gonzalez and the seven other women's bodies were found in November 2001, ex-Chihuahua Attorney General
Arturo Gonzalez Rascon immediately fingered two local bus drivers as the culprits. Yet doubts about their guilt arose,
especially after Grijalva -- who was Rascon's evidence expert at the time -- resigned from his post, citing pressure to
fabricate evidence against them. And the head of a local prison was forced from office when he documented signs of
torture on the accused men after they had returned from Rascon's office.
Four months later, in February 2002, a search-and-rescue team combing the cotton field found Claudia lvette Gonzalez's
overalls in a plastic bag, along with strands of hair and other crucial pieces of evidence that Rascon's investigators had
failed to discover. In response, Rascon offered his opinion to the El Paso Times: "The state police have done a thoroughly
professional job. I have no doubt about that." But on Oct. 28, DNA results revealed that Rascon's investigators had
properly identified only one of the eight dead women -- Gonzalez.
Stuck with a far more dubious task than catching one madman or replacing one feeble leader, Juarez's fractured civil
society has been paralyzed. A cynical mood is palpable just by speaking to citizens on the street, who unanimously
express fear and distrust of law-enforcement and government officials. Some local cops are just as cynical.
"We can't just sit around in deserted places waiting for someone to drive up and dump bodies off," said one municipal
police officer seated in an idling paddy wagon who refused to give his name for security reasons. "There are too few of us
and the city's too big ... We don't get much support from the federal government. Judicially, we are not protected like cops
in the U.S. Plus, the arms they give us are weak and the bulletproof vests don't really stop bullets. It's not just that,
though. I have a young woman in my home so I can put myself in the place of the parents who have lost their daughters.
But it's a question of society. We need their support and they need them to be more conscious if it is going to get any
better here."
The scope of the crime is so enormous, and there has been so little success in stopping it, that suspicion breeds on itself.
The litany of theories as to who the killers are and what their motive might be suggests that Juarez has become a
breeding ground for every imaginable predator. And yet, nobody knows. Nothing is certain. And that feeds the climate of
paranoia.
Garcia and Gonzalez's murders are rumored to be the work of a serial killer with possible ties to drug dealers. Yet Garcia
was found with marks on her wrists that, according to local forensics experts, were identical to those made by police
handcuffs. And upon the discovery of her daughter's overalls, Josefina Gonzalez told the El Paso Times that someone
powerful was undoubtedly responsible for the murder.
Many in Mexico's law enforcement community agree that a ring of rich men are behind some of the killings, but they have
no evidence to support the theory. Some suggest that some young men from the local aristocracy are responsible, but are
being protected by their parents. A persistent theory holds that the murders -- or a significant subset of them -- are linked
to powerful narcotraficantes who have co-opted segments of the local ruling class.
And the cynicism has been exacerbated by the fact that of the 17 men and one woman accused as serial killer
masterminds of the murders, only one has been convicted, Abdel Latif Sharif Sharif, an Egyptian chemist and resident of
Texas at the time of his extradition to Mexico in 1995. Currently, Sharif is awaiting sentencing for allegedly paying a drug
trafficker named Victor Manuel Rivera Moreno to carry out about a dozen murders. However, evidence against Sharif is
suspect and charges against him have been changed repeatedly. Once he was even charged with killing a woman,
Elizabeth Ontiveros, who showed up later at police offices to prove she was alive.
In 1996, Sharif was accused of paying the gang Los Rebeldes to kill 17 women. Then, in 1999, he was charged with hiring
five bus drivers and an El Paso man from his jail cell to kill seven women. Officials claimed Sharif hired the killers to
deflect blame from himself. By 1999, judges had cleared him of all charges, citing an absence of concrete evidence and
the possibility of witness intimidation by prosecutors.
Suly Ponce, who supervised the case, has yet to make a compelling case against him. In a 1999 radio interview, rather
than presenting hard evidence, she claimed Sharif was aggressively hostile toward women because of his Egyptian
background. Now she says that the case against Sharif hinges on Moreno's declaration that Sharif paid him to carry out
the killings with money he earned from 13 patents he developed for Benchmark Research and Technology. But according
to an article in the El Paso Times, Benchmark has never paid employees for patent development. In a telephone interview
last week with Salon, Ponce said she hadn't known this. Angela Paiaveras, the current special prosecutor, declined to
discuss Sharif's case or any aspect of the investigations.
Many local residents scoff at the notion that the killers have been caught. "We don't believe that the guys they have
arrested are the killers," says Miguel Angel Jaramillo, a mid-level manager for the Lear Corp. "It's obvious that they're just
scapegoats."
Yet Ponce remains ardent in her belief that Sharif is at the center of the murders. "Today the killings continue because
there are many imitators," she told Salon last week. "But after Sharif was caught, there were almost no homicides for a
year." But according to the Juarez daily El Diario, the year immediately after Sharif was jailed -- a period spanning from
October 1995 to October 1996 -- 28 young women were found murdered.
Meanwhile, the theories flourish and become more and more paranoid, reflecting a breakdown in public trust. By one
popular theory, the women are being murdered at blood rituals for a cabal of wealthy, powerful men. Another theory posits
a financial motive for murder. "We're finding a lot of girls that are mutilated in the same way," says a young municipal

police officer who declined to give his name. "Someone's probably killing them to take their organs to sell them for a lot of
money in the U.S." When asked if there was any evidence to support the theory, the officer replied that it was only a
hunch.
Such a climate sends a message to the killers every day: You can get away with anything, even a crime on this scale. But
where such a climate breeds cynicism and hopelessness among people who live and work here, it has also provoked an
incipient revolt.
On her radio show "Grueso Calibre" ("Large Caliber"), popular host Samira lzaguirre frequently aired the views of guests
who were critical of how authorities handled the murders. When Attorney General Rascon accused the two bus drivers of
the cotton field murders in November 2001, lzaguirre hosted the drivers' wives on her show. After that interview,
advertisements began appearing in local newspapers smearing lzaguirre with claims that she frequented strip clubs and
was romantically involved with one of the bus drivers. News media on both sides of the border have reported that the
receipt for the ad was signed by government officials who paid for it.
Then, in February, when lzaguirre started organizing a vigil and announced a hunger strike on her show on Radio Canon,
she was fired. Fearing for her safety, she moved across the border to El Paso.
Others, too, have discovered that pressing the complaint too forcefully brings reprisal. Marisela Ortiz, co-director of
Nuestras Hijas Regreso a Casa (Our Daughters Back Home), a legal support group for victims' parents, was a frequent
guest on "Grueso Calibre." Like Izaguirre, Ortiz has focused her resources on drawing attention to government and police
incompetence in the slain women's cases. And she says that, like lzaguirre, she has faced ever-increasing danger.
In Nuestras Hijas' office in central Juarez, located inside a small one-story row house with a "For Rent" sign out front,
Ortiz described the shadow of terror that has stalked her since she began pressuring the authorities.
She claims she was threatened by ex-Chihuahua District Attorney Arturo Gonzalez Rascon. "Rascon came all the way to
Juarez [from Chihuahua City] to tell me not to involve myself in all the cases," she tells Salon. "Then I got a message on
my phone saying: 'You have daughters that are alive. Take care of them." Rascon, in an earlier story by the Associated
Press, denied the allegation.
Last May, Ortiz says, she was pursued by men in a black pickup truck who tried to kidnap her. She believes the attempt
was orchestrated by Rascon's office since it occurred only a day before she had planned to travel to El Paso for a meeting
with the FBI and Texas state Sen. Eliot Shapleigh, D-El Paso, who is calling for a bi-national investigation into the
murders.
Victims' parents who came to Nuestras Hijas for help in finding their missing daughters also say they have been
threatened. Mario Lee Lopez and his wife, Soledad Aguilar, lost their daughter, Cecilia Covarrubias. She was kidnapped
in 1995 along with their granddaughter, who was two months old. By now their granddaughter would be 7, and Lopez and
Aguilar's own investigation has led them to believe that she is alive and living in the custody of a well-connected local
family.
To an outsider it is a desperate story, all but impossible to prove. Lopez accuses Ponce of coordinating the coverup of the
kidnappings and murder: again, Ponce denies the charge. And she was adamant that government officials have harassed
no one. "I didn't have any knowledge of threats against anybody," she said. "On the contrary, we support the families and
they are encouraged to be intimately involved in the investigations."
Lopez recalls an incident in which he had gone to Juarez's judicial building to press his granddaughter's case and did not
exactly find the kind of support Ponce mentioned. While leaving the court, Lopez says, he was confronted by a high-
ranking minister who warned that if he didn't drop the investigation, he would be tortured with electric shock devices.
"But it's too late to stop now," Lopez adds with a wistful smile.
Despite the campaign against lzaguirre, or perhaps because of it, the vigil took place as scheduled in March. It was an
unprecedented show of solidarity, with thousands of people gathered in the cotton field where Gonzalez and the seven
others were found in an irrigation ditch. There are still tatters of yellow police tape there, and candleholders left from the
vigil are strewn over the site. Eight red crosses mark the spot where the bodies were found.
However, city officials have no plans to memorialize the site as Juarez's residents have. In fact, according to a Sept. 4
article in El Diario, the site is now being used as a dumping ground for Juarez's Department of Parks and Gardens.
Near downtown Juarez there is a monument to Abraham Lincoln, honoring him for "establishing North American
industries, today the most important in the world." Not far away is a simple gallery where the Collective Antigone [Antigone
Collective], a group of local artists, has organized a series of public performances, installations and conferences focused
on Juarez's crisis of violence.
Each week, the artists gather to collaborate and discuss strategy. At a table with 12 other artists and writers, in an
expansive room filled with cubist-inspired paintings, Antonio Munoz Ortega, a 51-year-old writer, describes the Collective's
goals and the problems confronting the group. "Our government is authoritarian, and authoritarian governments are
principally concerned with the manipulation of life," he says. "The victims' families feel manipulated by the authorities'
insensitivity and this has manifested a greater and greater cynicism here that's really dangerous. The struggle, then, is for
reparation and simply regaining our daily lives."
Ortega says he was moved to action by Samira Izaguirre's candlelight vigil in March. He describes the building of an
impromptu church in front of the Association of Maquiladoras office as an effort to "communicate through a different
language, one that's symbolic." This decision, he says, helped lead to the formation of the Collective.

The rallying cry for Collectiva Antigona, as evidenced by the name, has been Sophocles Greek tragedy, "Antigone,"
which tells the tale of a girl's persecution at the hands of a cruel dictator for burying her brother. The Collectiva has
organized readings of the play around the state of Chihuahua and plans a public performance in the future.
The Collectiva also has begun to establish a visual presence around central Juarez, most noticeably by painting a wall
spanning an entire block with poetry written by participants in a recent writer's conference on violence against women. On
Nov. 1 and 2, the Mexican holiday Dia de los Muertos, the collective filled a room with traditional altars honoring the
victims along with a giant cross in the center of the room covered with masks, intended to symbolize the anonymity of the
victims. An estimated 1,500 people viewed the exhibit. A week later, working with Nuestras Hijas, the collective placed a
coffin and flowers and had a bonfire in the cotton field ditch where Claudia Ivette Gonzalez and seven others were found.
"It is absolutely necessary to affect civil society with the intention of shaking the indolence and to provoke some sort of
reaction from the people," says Mariela Paniagua, a 41-year-old painter. "People are no longer affected by what is
happening in this city. They have lost the capacity for outrage in the face of these acts."
While Collectiva Antigona meets, another group gathers a few miles away to combat Juarez's violence by drastically
different means. Past the seemingly endless rows of cardboard hovels in the desperately poor CoIonia Morelos, beyond
the municipal dump, on a rocky desert mesa in the shadow of Mount Indio, members of a search-and-rescue group called
Banda Civil spread out through the hills to search for more murder victims.
Luz Elena Guerrero Guerra, a strong-looking woman in her late 50s with an intense gaze, serves as president of one of
Banda Civil's six divisions. Guerra tells of how it began as a search-and-rescue group in 1985 to assist during a massive
earthquake in Mexico City and evolved to respond to Juarez's crisis. She herself found the first slain women's bodies in
1989, before investigators had even identified the deadly trend. Today, Banda Civil's members still lend their help during
natural disasters but the bulk of their work comes in the search for bodies, monitoring of schools and a citywide crime-
awareness campaign.
Ever-present terror, coupled with the impotence of Juarez's authorities, forced Banda Civil's transformation, Guerra says.
"I've narrowly escaped violence many times," she explains. "Sometimes it is just pure luck that a bus or a taxi happens to
come by in time when someone is chasing me ... All of us, we're uncertain of what the authorities are telling us. That's our
indignation. If they [the authorities] aren't interested in helping, we'll pressure them."
Because the group is required by law to cooperate with police, some view it with suspicion. Yet they have had success
where most other activist groups have failed. It was Banda Civil members who made the crucial discovery of Claudia
lvette Gonzalez's overalls in February, humiliating Attorney General Rascon and breathing new life into the investigation.
And Banda Civil has continued to find more evidence during their weekly searches of Juarez's human dumping grounds.
Besides its role as a search-and-rescue/quasi-vigilante group, Banda Civil has the feel of a support group, providing
members with an outlet from the daily fear that comes with life in Juarez. According to Guerra, over 300 people have
accompanied the group on searches and many of them are family members of missing women. And indeed, the searches
are a family activity.
On one recent Saturday, the search was joined by about 60 participants of all ages and from all sectors of Juarez society,
including a middle manager from the Lear Corp. There were no terrible discoveries that day, and yet afterward, as people
stood around talked and listened to norteno music blaring from a car stereo, it was evident just how deeply the murders
are ingrained into life here -- and how some people are fighting back with whatever tools they have at hand. Perhaps the
quiet optimism is derived from the age-old Mexican axiom that death brings about rebirth.
"Instead of spending our time criticizing the authorities, we're trying to find some solutions," says Santos. "We all have
sisters and daughters here and we all feel the same. My daughter is in danger. I can't let her live like this."

Germany in Need of a Dream
By JOHN KORNBLUM
Has Germany abandoned Europe? Do Angela Merkel's tough conditions for aid to Greece mean that Germany is no
longer the motor of European integration? Has Frau Merkel in fact morphed from the Miss Europa of 2007 to the Fraulein
Germania of 2010, as Germany's own former foreign minister Joschka Fischer has suggested?
As a former American ambassador who has lived arid worked the better part of four decades around Germany, my
Blackberry often glows red hot with messages from persons asking these questions. My response is always the same:
Germany has changed very little, but Europe and the world have changed a lot. Therein lies the dilemma.
Germany has worked hard to dig its way out of the disaster of 1945, but trauma remains a defining issue for German
society. Sixty five years later, Germany is still focused on the three essentials of its recovery: stability, respectability and
peace. Keep this triangle in mind and lots of things quickly come into focus.
From the first days of the Federal Republic. Germany's leaders emphasized the importance of defining interests solely
within a common European and Atlantic vocation. But they also understood that renouncing national ambitions did not
remove the responsibility to pursue specific German goals through the common institutions.
Many important postwar accomplishments were conceived and pushed by Germany, sometimes over the opposition of
others — including the United States. Ostpolitik was controversial for years, as was NATO enlargement. Germany pushed
them with determination.
Helmut Kohl did not consult before promulgating his 10 points on reunification. He agreed to French desires for a common
currency, but only if it could be a mirror of the Deutsche mark, for decades the European monetary standard. The euro
stability pact, now the object of so much controversy with Greece, was the result. After 1990, the E.U.'s eastward
expansion was Germany's way of firming up its Eastern flank.
Slowly and without fanfare, Germany has been remaking the European Union in its image. At each step of the way,
Germany made its wishes more palatable by paying more than its share. Part of today's misunderstanding is caused by
Germany's success in using its contributions to build an image of selflessness. Germany has been as single-minded in
pursuit of its goals as Charles de Gaulle ever was for his, but it almost always left leadership to others.
A new consciousness grew after the costs of reunification began to mount. "Europe" in the institutional sense has become
increasingly unpopular. German courts have begun to define German European issues in the context of the German
Constitution rather than on the basis of E.U. law. At least some of Ms. Merkel's refusal to allow immediate assistance to
Greece was based on her fears that it would fan anti-E.U. sentiment at home. Are these the first signs of a German Tea
Party?
Here we find the source of most of the hand wringing about Germany's role as the "motor of Europe." Ms. Merkel's
unwillingness to sweeten the financial pot echoed throughout Brussels. To many, it signified the decline of German
willingness to "salute the French flag three times before raising the German flag," as Konrad Adenauer used to put it.
Germans are not alone in objecting to throwing more money into the E.U. pot, but they happen to be the only ones who
can do something about it. Many fear that without German complaisance, the E.U. will stutter to a stop. But such self-

denial could never offer a viable foundation for a new Europe. Neither could the inefficiency and even corruption that
characterizes many E.U. programs.
Most maddening for most thinking Europeans is the knowledge that the Germans are right. But to them, the question is
whether Germany is remaking the E.U. in a fashion palatable to the majority of other member states. They are not so sure
that its focus on stability and accountability is the right way to help such a diverse collection of peoples adjust to a
globalized world.
And so when Angela Merkel raps Greek knuckles, she is sending a message most Europeans don't want to hear. Not that
Germany is dangerous; even worse, that it is unrelenting. The Neue aricher Zeitung probably spoke for many others
when it once accused Germany of wanting Europe to become a large Switzerland.
The growing gap between Germany's aspirations and the perceived needs of other members of the E.U. is beginning to
burden both sides. Most Europeans are simply not ready to live up to German standards. Without a more flexible sense of
common purpose, the project to build a democratic Europe could stop dead in the water. But as Germans will themselves
often tell you: They have forgotten how to dream.
Younger Germans feel this lack of inspiration as well. Dreams were what 200,000 of them were waiting to hear when they
rallied to hear Barack Obama in Berlin two summers ago. They wanted more than to "Dare to Hope," which is the
characteristically timid German translation of the title of the president's best seller. And they are still waiting. America
seems busy elsewhere.
The main conclusion I draw from the debate about Germany is that it is not about Germany at all. The task of building a
democratic Europe is far from complete. Most of the foundations have been laid and now the residents are starting to
haggle over the design. Weaving today's 27 states into a true trans-Atlantic partnership is a task that is too big for
Germany or even Europe to accomplish alone. They desperately need some skilled architectural assistance.
Uniting Europe and North America is the most audacious project ever conceived. If it works, the United States will be
joined by nearly 500 million Europeans to form a democratic space, within which modern democratic values will harness
more energy than in any single nation on earth. Democracy's future as the operating system for a globalized world will be
assured.
European fecklessness seems to worry Washington officials these days. But if Germany has forgotten how to dream and
the United States is too busy to try, we will both be guilty of perpetuating the aimlessness we so criticize. To hold up its
side of the bargain, Europe needs exactly what Barack Obama originally promised — the audacity of hope.
John Kornblum, senior counselor with the international law firm Noerr LLP in Berlin, served as the U.S. ambassador to
Germany from 1997 to 2001.

The UK election, I think, reflects lingering fixation on Tony. They just can't get over him. The British public feels like the
wife he abandoned for George W. Bush, wants vengeance, yet still pines for him. Clegg is a Tony stand-in love object,
Cameron a pretender. Alas, poor Gordon, Heathcliffe, unloved, unlovable, suffering.

Re: Greek economic crisis; transatlantic consequences
CC: Cheryl
A potential second major phase of the economic crisis, at least in Europe, likely with repercussions in the US, is
being triggered with the designation of Greece to junk band status, on the edge of default, with Portugal, Spain,
and perhaps even Ireland at tipping points. This is more than a further unfolding of the economic crisis,
threatening recovery; fissures within the transatlantic relationship will now be under intensifying strain. More
than statements from Treasury should be forthcoming in the days ahead. This is about the future of the
transatlantic relationship. Reassuring words about our enduring commitment will matter.
I've been having conversations with John Kornblum and those discussions prompted this email from him a
couple of days ago, before the latest Greek event:
-- the economic crisis is starting to have a negative effect on dynamics among EU
members. Tensions over deficits, Greece etc are uncovering major gaps among the major players.

Re: Greek economic crisis; transatlantic consequences
CC: Cheryl
A potential second major phase of the economic crisis, at least in Europe, likely with
repercussions in the US, is being triggered with the designation of Greece to junk band status, on
the edge of default, with Portugal, Spain, and perhaps even Ireland at tipping points. This is more
than a further unfolding of the economic crisis, threatening recovery; fissures within the
transatlantic relationship will now be under intensifying strain. More than statements from
Treasury should be forthcoming in the days ahead. This is about the future of the transatlantic
relationship. Reassuring words about our enduring commitment will matter.
I've been having conversations with John Komblum and those discussions prompted this email
from him a couple of days ago, before the latest Greek event:
-- the economic crisis is starting to have a negative effect on dynamics among EU
members. Tensions over deficits, Greece etc are uncovering major gaps among the
major players.
-- Germany has emerged stronger than others. German voters believe (correctly) that
they have sacrificed to maintain stability and are increasingly angry over signs of
obvious mismanagement by Greece and others. The strains of Afghanistan are being
felt by everyone and while the President is very popular in Europe, EU leaders miss the

h: FYI, Iran document Gary Sick sent me. Sid
From Gary Sick
Mojtaba Samareh Hashemi is a senior adviser to President Ahmadinejad and a devoted proponent of the Divine Right of
Kings doctrine of ultra-conservative ayatollah Mesbah-Yazdi. Many regard him as an eminence grise of the Iranian regime
and an important bridge between the Revolutionary Guards, the fanatic-fringe ayatollahs, and the presidency. So his
words are worth listening to as clues to what is happening inside the closed circles of the Iranian leadership.
Today he was quoted by the Fars news agency (in Persian) on the troublesome issue of U.S.-Iran relations. Although the
statement was translated into English, it needs more than a word-for-word translation in order to be understood. So I have
added my own interpretation of what Mojtaba really meant to say.
"Obama not only did not manage to realize his slogan [of change], but has pursued the dark policies of Bush all over the
world ever more energetically..."
[real meaning: Oh, how we miss George Bush! He was such an easy target. With him we were winning everywhere and
America's credibility was falling to the point of disappearance even among its friends.]
"The Bush presidency is one of the darkest eras of the United States and the greatest hatred emerged internationally
towards the United States..."
[Why can't Obama be more like Bush? In the good old days we didn't have to keep answering questions about why we
would not accept an outstretched hand of friendship. It was all so much easier then.]
"Today we see that the United States rather than moving its military forces out of Iraq and Afghanistan has increased their
number which has led to mass murder of the people and increased impoverishment in these countries. Obama had said
that he wanted to oppose violation of human rights and wanted to close Guantanamo and secret prisons in Europe. Did
this happen? Of course not..."
[The United States has announced its withdrawal from Iraq and actually seems to be on schedule; in the meantime, our
favorite parties and politicians in Iraq have not done all that well in the Iraqi elections despite our support. The Shi'i
religious leaders in Najaf openly dismiss the idea of an Islamic Republic and are increasingly competing with us, instead
of following our lead. In Afghanistan, the Americans seem to be serious about announcing a date certain for withdrawal,
and they even seem to be edging up to a Karzai reconciliation strategy with the Taliban. How can we attack them with a
straight face when they behave this way!]
"There has also not been any correction of the dark policy of Bush towards Iran's nuclear program or [the United State's]
opposition towards the Iranian nation..."
[Their willingness to meet with us and that dastardly offer of a uranium swap were hugely embarrassing. Now every time
we sit down with a foreign leader we have to listen to tiresome suggestions that we should reconsider our position on the
uranium swap — even from the Russians and Chinese. You can't trust anyone these days!]
"We do not want anything from the United States. The Iranian nation demands its rights to be recognized and
respected..."
[All we want from the Americans is the return of George Bush! Even John McCain would be an improvement. I wonder if
Sarah Palin has any chance? We'll keep our fingers crossed.]
"The Islamic Republic has not become isolated, rather, it is expanding [its foreign relations] ever more and is finding new

friends... if they have claims, they must show it in their actions so the Iranian nation gradually trusts them..."
[We have never been so alone since the earliest years of the revolution. Even dictators and police states are privately
expressing sympathy to us for the way our crackdown on the Green Movement attracted sympathetic attention all over the
world. And it's all the fault of that *&!*Obama and the %$#! internet. The shah never had all these problems. Ah, for the
good old days...]

htto://www. haaretz.com/hasers/spagesil 158992. html
Aluf Benn / Netanyahu leaves U.S. disgraced, isolated and weaker
By Ake Berm
Details emerging from Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to Washington remain incomplete, but the conclusion may nonetheless
be drawn that the prime minister erred in choosing to fly to the United States this week. The visit - touted as a fence-
mending effort, a bid to strengthen the tenuous ties between Netanyahu and U.S. President Barack Obama - only
highlighted the deep rift between the American and Israeli administrations.
The prime minister leaves America disgraced, isolated, and altogether weaker than when he came.
Instead of setting the diplomatic agenda, Netanyahu surrendered control over it. Instead of leaving the Palestinian issue
aside and focusing on Iran, as he would like, Netanyahu now finds himself fighting for the legitimacy of Israeli control over
East Jerusalem.
Advertisement
The most sensitive and insoluble core issues - those which when raised a decade ago led to the dissolution of
the peace process and explosion of the second intifada - are now being served as a mere appetizer.
At the start of his visit, Netanyahu was tempted to bask in the warm welcome he received at the AIPAC conference, at
which he gave his emotional address on Jerusalem.
Taking a page from Menachem Begin, he spoke not on behalf of the State of Israel, but in the name of the Jewish people
itself and its millennia of history.
His speech was not radical rightist rhetoric. Reading between the lines, one could spot a certain willingness to relinquish
West Bank settlements as long as Israel maintains a security buffer in the Jordan Valley.
But at the White House, the prime minister's speech to thousands of pro-Israel activists and hundreds of cheering
congressmen looked like an obvious attempt to raise political capital against the American president.
Knowing Netanyahu would be reenergized by his speech at the lobby, Obama and his staff set him a honey trap. Over the
weekend they sought to quell the row that flared up during U.S. Vice President Joe Biden's trip here two weeks ago, and
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described Netanyahu's response to the ultimatums Washington presented to him
as "useful."
Special envoy George Mitchell made a televised visit to the prime minister's bureau Sunday to invite Netanyahu to the
White House. Washington, it seemed, was trying to make nice.
Far from it. Just when Netanyahu thought he had resolved the crisis by apologizing to Biden, Clinton called him up for a
dressing down.
This time as well, Netanyahu almost believed the crisis had passed, that he had survived by offering partial. noncommittal
answers to the Americans' questions. Shortly before meeting with Obama, Netanyahu even warned the Palestinians that

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768882 Date: 08/31/2015
should they continue to demand a freeze on construction, he would postpone peace talks by a year.
His arrogant tone underscored the fact that Netanyahu believed that on the strength of his AIPAC speech, he could call
the next few steps of the diplomatic dance.
But then calamity struck. At their White House meeting, Obama made clear to his guest that the letter Netanyahu had
sent was insufficient and returned it for further corrections. Instead of a reception as a guest of honor, Netanyahu was
treated as a problem child, an army private ordered to do laps around the base for slipping up at roll call.
The revolution in the Americans' behavior is clear to all. On Sunday morning Obama was still anxiously looking ahead to
the House of Representatives vote on health care - the last thing he wanted was a last-minute disagreement with
congressmen over ties with Israel.
The moment the bill was passed, however, a victorious Obama was free to deal with his unruly guest.
The Americans made every effort to downplay the visit. As during his last visit in November, Netanyahu was invited to the
White House at a late hour, without media coverage or a press conference. If that were not enough, the White House
spokesman challenged Netanyahu's observation at AIPAC that "Jerusalem is not a settlement."
The Americans didn't even wait for him to leave Washington to make their disagreement known. It was not the behavior
Washington shows an ally, but the kind it shows an annoyance.
The approval of construction at the Shepherd Hotel in Sheikh Jarrah, announced before his meeting with Obama, again
caught Netanyahu unawares. Apparently the special panel appointed after the Ramat Shlomo debacle to prevent such
surprises failed its first test.
Netanyahu is having his most difficult week since returning to office, beginning with the unfortunate decision to relocate
the planned emergency room at Ashkelon's Barzilai Medical Center and lasting through his humiliating jaunt through
Washington.
Returning to Israel today, Netanyahu will need to work hard to rehabilitate his image, knowing full well that Obama will not
relent, but instead demand that he stop zigzagging and decide, once and for all, whether he stands with America or with
the settlers.

The Petraeus briefing: Biden's embarrassment
is not the whole story
Posted By Mark Perry 4Saturday, March 13, 2010 -
On Jan. 16, two days after a killer earthquake hit Haiti, a team of senior military officers from the U.S. Central Command
(responsible for overseeing American security interests in the Middle East), arrived at the Pentagon to brief Joint Chiefs of
Staff Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The team had been dispatched by CENTCOM
commander Gen. David Petraeus to underline his growing worries at the lack of progress in resolving the issue. The 33-
slide, 45-minute PowerPoint briefing stunned Mullen. The briefers reported that there was a growing perception among
Arab leaders that the U.S. was incapable of standing up to Israel, that CENTCOM's mostly Arab constituency was losing
faith in American promises, that Israeli intransigence on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was jeopardizing U.S. standing in
the region, and that Mitchell himself was (as a senior Pentagon officer later bluntly described it) "too old, too slow ... and
too late."
The January Mullen briefing was unprecedented. No previous CENTCOM commander had ever expressed himself on
what is essentially a political issue; which is why the briefers were careful to tell Mullen that their conclusions followed
from a December 2009 tour of the region where, on Petraeus's instructions, they spoke to senior Arab leaders.
"Everywhere they went, the message was pretty humbling," a Pentagon officer familiar with the briefing says. "America
was not only viewed as weak, but its military posture in the region was eroding." But Petraeus wasn't finished: two days
after the Mullen briefing, Petraeus sent a paper to the White House requesting that the West Bank and Gaza (which, with
Israel, is a part of the European Command -- or EUCOM), be made a part of his area of operations. Petraeus's reason
was straightforward: with U.S. troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. military had to be perceived by Arab
leaders as engaged in the region's most troublesome conflict.
[UPDATE: A senior military officer denied Sunday that Petraeus sent a paper to the White House.
"CENTCOM did have a team brief the CJCS on concerns revolving around the Palestinian issue, and CENTCOM did
propose a UCP change, but to CJCS, not to the WH," the officer said via email. "GEN Petraeus was not certain what
might have been conveyed to the WH (if anything) from that brief to CJCS."
(UCP means "unified combatant command," like CENTCOM; CJCS refers to Mullen; and WH is the White House.)]
The Mullen briefing and Petraeus's request hit the White House like a bombshell. While Petraeus's request that
CENTCOM be expanded to include the Palestinians was denied ("it was dead on arrival," a Pentagon officer confirms),
the Obama administration decided it would redouble its efforts -- pressing Israel once again on the settlements issue,
sending Mitchell on a visit to a number of Arab capitals and dispatching Mullen for a carefully arranged meeting with the
chief of the Israeli General Staff, Lt. General Gabi Ashkenazi. While the American press speculated that Mullen's trip
focused on Iran, the JCS Chairman actually carried a blunt, and tough, message on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: that
Israel had to see its conflict with the Palestinians "in a larger, regional, context" -- as having a direct impact on America's
status in the region. Certainly, it was thought, Israel would get the message.

Israel didn't. When Vice President Joe Biden was embarrassed by an Israeli announcement that the Netanyahu
government was building 1,600 new homes in East Jerusalem, the administration reacted. But no one was more outraged
than Biden who, according to the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth, engaged in a private, and angry, exchange with the
Israeli Prime Minister. Not surprisingly, what Biden told Netanyahu reflected the importance the administration attached to
Petraeus's Mullen briefing: "This is starting to get dangerous for us," Biden reportedly told Netanyahu. "What you're doing
here undermines the security of our troops who are fighting in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. That endangers us and it
endangers regional peace." Yedioth Ahronoth went on to report: "The vice president told his Israeli hosts that since many
people in the Muslim world perceived a connection between Israel's actions and US policy, any decision about
construction that undermines Palestinian rights in East Jerusalem could have an impact on the personal safety of
American troops fighting against Islamic terrorism." The message couldn't be plainer: Israel's intransigence could cost
American lives.
There are important and powerful lobbies in America: the NRA, the American Medical Association, the lawyers -- and the
Israeli lobby. But no lobby is as important, or as powerful, as the U.S. military. While commentators and pundits might
reflect that Joe Biden's trip to Israel has forever shifted America's relationship with its erstwhile ally in the region, the real
break came in January, when David Petraeus sent a briefing team to the Pentagon with a stark warning: America's
relationship with Israel is important, but not as important as the lives of America's soldiers. Maybe Israel gets the message
now.

My piece on the briefing of Admiral Mullen by CENTCOM senior officers has occasioned a great deal of comment, as
well as some skepticism: how accurate is the account? Was it told to me by direct participants in the briefing? Is
there any basis for imagining that Petraeus has any kind of hidden agenda, whether that is a desire to expand
CENTCOM — or even hostility towards Israel.
I won't name my sources, even though it's clear to people in the Pentagon — and certainly to General Petraeus — who
they are. Was I told of the briefing by the briefers themselves? I will only say that there were four people in the
briefing — the two briefers, Admiral Mullen, and Admiral Mullen's primary adviser on the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict. I know two of the people involved in the briefing. Whether or not they are my sources is something for the
reader to determine. The account is not only accurate, it's a precis of what actually happened. There is a lot more to
it. The White House, State Department and Pentagon have not denied the account, and for good reason: it's true.
Is there any basis for imagining that Petraeus has any kind of hidden agenda in ordering the briefing?
I have been reporting on the American military for thirty years. My work on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Four Stars, is
the authoritative account on the subject. I have deeply rooted contacts in the military that go back thirty years. I
have never met a senior military officer whom I do not admire. There is no greater insult than to believe that General
Petraeus or any other senior American military officer would use the lives of American soldiers as a lever to enhance
their own political future. My sense is that General Petraeus neither likes nor dislikes Israel: but he loves his country
and he wants to protect our soldiers. The current crisis in American relations with Israel is not a litmus test of
General Petraeus's loyalty to Israel, but of his, and our, concern for those Americans in uniform in the Middle East.
It is, perhaps, a sign of the depth of "the Biden crisis" that every controversy of this type seems to get translated into
whether or not America and its leaders are committed to Israel's security. This isn't about Israel's security, it's about
our security.

Netanyahu and Pastor Hagee's Lovefest on Eve of Biden's
Arrival in Israel
On 03.09.10, By Max
(Videos recorded by Rachel Tabachnick; more videos coming shortly.)
Vice President Joe Biden was greeted in Jerusalem with the announcement that the Israeli Interior Ministry approved the
construction of 1600 new homes in Occupied East Jerusalem contrary to U.S. wishes and complicating Biden's mission to
help jump start the peace process. But Biden should have known that Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu intended to upset his
plans by Netanyahu's appearance with John Hagee.
The day after a series of talks between US Special Envoy for the Middle East George Mitchell and Netanyahu, and a day
before Biden's arrival, Netanyahu appeared onstage with Pastor John Hagee in Jerusalem. The occasion was Hagee's
Night To Honor Israel, an event the far-right Texas-based preacher arranged to tout his ministry's millions in donations to
Israeli organizations and to level bellicose rhetoric against Israel's perceived enemies.
At the gathering, Hagee called Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad "the Hitler of the Middle East" and denounced
the Goldstone Report as "character assassination by an unbiased and uninformed committee."
Netanyahu welcomed the crowd of 1000 American evangelicals to Jerusalem, a city he described as "the undivided,
eternal capitol of the Jewish people. Then, he told them, "I salute you! The Jewish people salute you!" He used the rest of
his speech to call for "tough, biting sanctions" against Iran that "bite deep into its energy sector."

In the audience were top-level members of the Israeli government, from Ambassador Michael Oren to Jerusalem Mayor
Nir Barkat to Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon. Also present was Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, the chief rabbi of the illegal
West Bank settlement of Efrat who gained notoriety for lobbying President Bill Clinton to pardon his friend, fugitive
billionaire Marc Rich. Ayalon had stirred controversy days before when he refused to meet with a US congressional
delegation brought to Israel by the progressive Jewish group J Street.

Hagee's ceremony featured a 15-minute film highlighting the recipients of donations from John Hagee Ministries that
totaled $58 million since 2001. The recipients included Jewish settlements from the West Bank like Gush Etzion and
Shomron, which was involved in promoting an "Obama Hilltop project" that promoted more settlement building and
compared Obama to Pharoah. Hagee also announced funding for a pressure group run by the settlers evacuated from
Gush Katif in Gaza in 2005. During Israel's assault on Gaza in 2009, a group of Gush Katif residents lobbied the Israel
government to allow them to resettle the Palestinian coastal region.

Who Is Haoee Funding In Israel? from Max Blumenthal on Vimeo.
The most notable of Hagee's funding recipients was an organization called Im Tirtzu. A student representative of this
group appeared in the film to thank Hagee for "help[ing] us to ensure that students in Israel are on the right path, the path
of Zionism, the love of Israel, the path of solidarity." Another student called for "the second revolution in Israel."
In February, Im Tirtzu funding a smear campaign against former Knesset member and New Israel Fund Director Naomi
Chazan that included posters caricaturing her with a horn on her head. The group misleadingly accused the New Israel
Fund of bankrolling 16 human rights organizations that contributed documentation to the Goldstone Report.
The smear campaign led to unsuccessful legislation in the Knesset designed to further cripple already marginalized Israeli
human rights groups. Meanwhile, the Jerusalem Post fired Chazan as a columnist without explanation. Gideon Levy, a
columnist for Ha'aretz, called Im Tirtzu "a McCarthyite movement" for its attacks on Chazan.
Although CUFI attempted to distance itself from Im Tirtzu's campaign, the organization's appearance during CUFI's
Jerusalem ceremony suggested that Hagee would continue to provide it with funding well into the future.
Republican Senator John McCain repudiated the endorsement of Hagee during his 2008 presidential campaign after
Hagee's statements describing the Holocaust as a fulfillment of divine prophecy came to light. Hagee has also said that

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769013 Date: 08/31/2015
he believed the anti-Christ was "partially Jewish, as was Adolph Hitler." However, none of Hagee's comments have
deterred Israeli government officials from embracing him or accepting his millions in annual charity.
During Hagee's speech, he made no secret of his support for the illegal settlement enterprise that has been the source of
difficulties between the US and Israel. "The settlements are not the problem," he boomed from the podium. "The problem
is the refusal of Arab leaders to respect the right of Jewish people to live anywhere in the Middle East."
Hagee received a rousing ovation from the crowd and the Israeli government officials seated beside the podium when he
proclaimed, "World leaders do not have the authority to tell Israel and the Jewish people what they can and cannot do in
the city of Jerusalem. They don't have the authority to tell them what they can and cannot build, who can and and cannot
live there."
The following day, on March 9, Vice President Joseph Biden arrived in Israel to meet with Netanyahu and officials from
the Palestinian Authority. He told reporters after touching down that he saw "a moment of real opportunity."

It's over: MPs say the special relationship with
S is dead
Winston Churchill, Franklin D Roosevelt and Josef Stalin
Michael Smith
BRITAIN'S special relationship with the US forged by Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt in the second world
war -- no longer exists, says a committee of influential MPs.
Instead, America's relationship with Britain is no more special than with its other main allies, according to a report by the
Commons foreign affairs committee published today.
The report also warns that the perception of the UK after the Iraq war as America's "subservient poodle" has been highly
damaging to Britain's reputation and interests around the world. The MPs conclude that British prime ministers have to
learn to be less deferential to US presidents and be "willing to say no" to America.
The report, entitled Global Security: UK-US Relations, says Britain's relationship with America is "extremely close and
valuable" in a number of areas, particularly intelligence co-operation. However, it adds that the use of the phrase special
relationship, in its historical sense, "is potentially misleading and we recommend that its use should be avoided".
It does not reflect the "ever-evolving" relationship between the two countries and raises unrealistic expectations, the MPs
say.
"Over the longer term, the UK is unlikely to be able to influence the US to the extent it has in the past," the committee
adds.
In an apparent rebuke to Tony Blair and his relationship with President George W Bush, the report says there are "many
lessons" to be learnt from Britain's political approach towards the US over Iraq.
"The perception that the British government was a subservient poodle to the US administration is widespread both among
the British public and overseas," the MPs say. "This perception, whatever its relation to reality, is deeply damaging to the
reputation and interests of the UK."
While the relationship between the American president and the British prime minister was an important part of dealings
between the two countries, the cabinet and parliament also had a role to play. "The UK needs to be less deferential and
more willing to say no to the US on those issues where the two countries' interests and values diverge," the MPs say.
They are also critical of the US use of extraordinary rendition and torture. The report calls for a comprehensive review of
the use by the CIA of British bases, such as that on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia, to carry out extraordinary
rendition.

"The issues relating to rendition through Diego Garcia to which we have previously drawn attention raise disturbing
questions about the uses to which US bases on British territory are put", the MPs say.
They express regret at "considerable restraints" on the ability of both the government and parliament to scrutinise US
activities carried out on British territory.
"We recommend that the government should establish a comprehensive review of the current arrangements governing
US military use of facilities within the UK and in British overseas territories." The review should "identify shortcomings in
the current system of scrutiny and oversight ... and report to parliament on proposals to remedy these".
The report also demands a statement from the government on the implications of the Court of Appeal judgment regarding
the alleged collusion of MI5 in the torture of Binyam Mohamed, a British resident.
Last month the court ordered the government to release evidence from American intelligence reports which showed that
MI5 was aware of the torture.
Senior US officials subsequently suggested that releasing such evidence might prevent the US from sharing some
intelligence with Britain.

New blow for Conservative alliance with UUP
as assembly member quits party
Alan McFarland follows MP Lady Hermon in resigning from Ulster Unionists to sit as independent
• Henry McDonaid, Ireland correspondent
• gi,;ardian.co.uk, Wednesday 31 March 2010 09.48 BST
The ConseNatives' alliance with the Ulster Unionists has sustained a second blow in North Down after last week's
resignation of the sitting MP Lady Hermon.
Assembly member and former army major Alan McFarland announced today that he was leaving the UUP in protest at its
pact with the Tories.
It is expected McFarland will now work for Herman's re-election as an independent against the official UUP-Tory
candidate.
A UUP statement said the timing of McFarland's announcement was "disappointing". He has been a UUP member of the
Stormont assembly for 12 years and was once a loyal ally of Lord Trimble, Nprthem Irelard's former first minister.
Trimble has been one of the driving forces behind the UUP-Conservative alliance.
Last night McFarland resigned his membership of the party and said he would now sit as an independent member of the
assembly.
"With the recent confirmation of candidates, including the imposition of a Conservative candidate in my own North Down
constituency,•it is clear that the party is determined to continue down the Conservative road," he said in a statement.
"I do not wish to join them. I am sorry to leave a party that contains many good friends, and greatly regret that events have
developed in the way they have."
Last week Hermon, the MP for North Down, said she would run in the general election as an independent unionist.
In a statement, the Ulster Unionist party thanked McFarland for his service, but said the "electoral pact has the potential to
transform politics in Northern Ireland in a manner not previously witnessed" in Ulster.

US foreign policy: aiting on a sun king
By Edward Luce and Daniel Dombey
Published: March 30 2010 22:22 I Last updated: March 30 2010 22:22
For better or for worse, Washington has grown
used to the fact that PgIrack Obama runs the
most centralised — or "White House-centric" —
administration since Richard Nixon. When Nixon
wanted foreign policy advice, everyone knew
where he got it from: Henry 'Kissinger, variously
his national security adviser and secretary of
state.
In contrast, Mr Obama has no big foreign policy
strategist. Even insiders give different answers
when asked to whom he turns for advice on the
big international questions. But almost all agree
with the following observation. "The truth is that
President Obama is his own Henry Kissinger —
no one else plays that role," says a senior official.
"Every administration reflects the personality of
the president. This president wants all the trains
Barack Obama at the Great Wall of China last year. Unlike his
predecessor Richard Nixon, who turned to Henry Kissinger for
advice, the US president has no big foreign policy strategist
routed through the Oval Office."
Fifteen months after he took office, the character and structure of Mr Obama's foreign policy machinery is still evolving.
But from interviews with dozens of insiders and outsiders, including senior officials both authorised and unauthorised to
speak, and three former national security advisers, it is clear the buck not only stops with, but often floats for quite a long
time around, Mr Obama himself.
Foreigners have complained about the tendency of his domestic agenda to crowd out the international one — the passage
last week of healthcare reform was greeted with an audible sigh of relief among US allies. But within foreign policy itself,
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769210 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769210 Date: 08/31/2015
his centralised structure can also result in many issues being left on the back burner awaiting presidential attention, say
critics.
"On the positive side, we have a very conscientious president who takes advice widely," says the official. "On the debit
side, for all the president's intelligence, Barack Obama came to office with very little experience. He just doesn't have
much depth on some issues.'
The core of Mr Obama's foreign policy machinery is in the White House-based National Security Council, which advises
the president and co-ordinates activities across an increasingly complex alphabet soup of Washington departments,
military commands and intelligence agencies. The most widely questioned link in the chain is Jim Jones, whom, to many
people's surprise, Mr Obama brought in as his national security adviser.
Only briefly acquainted with Mr Obama beforehand, General Jones, a retired four-star marine corps general, shows little
interest in running the "inter-agency" process — a key part of the job. Somewhat unconventionally, Gen Jones travels
frequently and is thus often out of town. Unusually, it is Mr Obama himself who usually chairs the weekly National Security
Council, known as the "principals meeting", not Gen Jones.
Rahm Emanuel, Mr Obama's chief of staff, is also a key part of it. "If you were to ask me who the real national security
adviser is, I would say there were three or four, of whom Rehm is one and of which Gen Jones is probably the least
important," says another official.
Anyone who has dealt with Gen Jones speaks highly of his matter-of-factness, his geniality and the respect many foreign
governments have for him — Pakistan and Israel among them. But as he himself admitted rather disarmingly last year, he
does not have a taste for bureaucracy. Speaking at the Atlantic Council, a think-tank where he previously worked, Gen
Jones provoked laughter when he said: "I fondly remember [the Atlantic Council] as a place where people actually did
what you asked them to do. In my new role I'm finding out that an order is a basis for negotiation."
The lack of a strong national security adviser has created recurring difficulties. Perhaps the best example is the Arab-
Israeli peace process, which Mr Obama launched on his second day in office when he appointed Geproe Mitphspil as his
envoy. Three months later, Mr Obama insisted Benjamin Netanyahu freeze all settlements activity in order to boost Arab
confidence in the talks.
In a heated ;34.16NA(dpyin the ,Clvg
li..0f7;ce. last May, in which Mr Netanyahu refused to accede to Mr Obama's demand, the
only officials present were Mr Emanuel and David Axelrod, senior adviser to Mr Obama in office and during the campaign.
Gen Jones was not there. The fallout put the talks in abeyance and damped high Arab hopes for Mr Obama.
"The question is, which bright spark advised the president to demand a settlements freeze without working out what the
next step should be when Netanyahu inevitably said 'No'?" says Leslie Gelb, an official in the Carter administration and
former head of the Council on Foreign Relations. "Why wasn't George Mitchell in the room? Where was Jones?"
Mr Obama's character is also stamped on the inter-agency process, set up and managed by Tom Donilon, deputy
national security adviser. The nitty-gritty of foreign policy-making is done at these frequent "deputies' meetings", which
can sometimes consume four to six hours a day.
Described by one insider as "the most powerful man in the White House whose name isn't widely known", Mr Donilon,
who was an official in the Clinton administration, is the man who keeps Mr Obama's trains running on time. And there are
a lot of trains. Last year, Mr Donilon held 270 deputies meetings — a workload described as "clinically insane" by a former
senior diplomat under Bill Clinton.
But as time goes on, it is becoming streamlined — now taking up roughly two to three hours a day, say officials. "People
forget that we inherited two wars, terrorism threats, and perhaps the biggest single eight-year decline [George W. Bush's
two terms] in America's power and reputation in our history," says a senior official. "It took time to put in place a process
that could deal with the very complex decisions we had to take."
Also the organiser of Mr Obama's 9.30arn national security briefing, Mr Donilon reinstated the paper trails needed to
prevent intra-governmental anarchy, using the model devised by Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser to George
Bush senior and Gerald Ford. Vice-president Joe Biden's team was also incorporated to prevent the kind of "parallel
process" Dick Cheney used to circumvent the bureaucracy under George W. Bush.
"If you look for the 2002 or 2003 meeting where the decision to go to war in iraq was taken, you cannot find it," says the
senior official. "By getting the process right, we are improving the quality of decisions."
The deputies' ties go back years. For example, the families of Mr Don;Ion and Jim Steinberg, deputy secretary of state,
often go on holiday together. Mr Donilon's wife, Cathy Russell, is chief of staff to Jill Biden, the vice-president's wife. Mr
Steinberg's wife, Sherburne Abbott, is deputy to John Holdren, Mr Obama's chief scientific adviser.
All those who regularly attend, including Michele Flournoy, a senior Pentagon official, and Susan Rice, the US
ambassador to the United Nations, have known each other since at least 1993, when they started off in the Clinton
administration. This is just as well, since they spend half their lives together: "A lot of work gets done in that group," says
Ms Flournoy. "Sometimes it feels like shovelling coal to keep the fires going."
The refurbished machinery was perhaps most in evidence during the build-up to Mr Obama's decision in December to
send another 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan — a journey that took four months and involved him in 40 hours of Oval
Office meetings.
But the very diligence of the process crowded out Mr Obama's time to focus on other crises — of which there are many.
"Time is the most precious commodity a president has," says a former national security adviser. "On average he is only
going to have 45 minutes a day for foreign policy, so you want to make sure it is well spent."

The widely expected departure of Gen Jones before the end of the year has also created rivalries within the engine room.
Those who are thought to have ambitions to replace him include Mr Steinberg, Ms Rice, Mr Donilon and Denis
McDonough, NSC chief of staff and the foreign policy official who is personally closest to Mr Obama. Although all are
widely respected, none is considered a big strategic thinker in the Kissinger or Scowcroft mould.
Described by Mr Gelb as Mr Obama's "Lord High Executioner", Mr McDonough "has appended himself to the Chicago
crowd", says another official. Mr McDonough's widely feared role highlights some of the contradictions of Mr Obama's
foreign policy apparatus.
Once an adviser to former Senate majority leader Tom Deschle, Mr McDonough was frequently at Mr Obama's side
during the campaign. Insiders describe him as the "enforcer" and as the keeper of "message discipline", a key element of
any campaign but something that can drastically slow the wheels of government.
"McDonough is the guy from the campaign and the one who plays basketball with the president — they're very close," says
an official. "Instead of Jim Jones telling McDonough what the president thinks, it is the other way round."
Indeed, if Mr Obama's highly centralised foreign policy machine had a face, it would be Mr McDonough's. "Donilon has
been perceived to make the process inclusive and give everyone a seat at the table," says David Rothkopf, a former
Clinton official and scholar on the NSC. "Fairly or not, McDonough has been perceived as representing a process that
was taking place in another room, among the inner circle, at a table to which most weren't invited."
Mr Obama has built a machine in which all roads lead to and from him. On the minus side, that means a lot of lower-level
meetings without decisions. It also means neglecting issues that cannot be squeezed into his diary, such as trade policy,
which continues to drift; or relations with India, which are unnecessarily tense.
And it means that the fingerprints of Mr Obama's political inner circle are detected by the rumour mill even when they are
absent, such as on the president's decision to begin the rog,,g: witsirawal from anistan. in July 2011 — a
recommendation that came from Robert Gates, secretary of defence.
On the plus side. Mr Obama has a sharp learning curve, which means his administration continues to evolve. On the plus
side also, if it has to be White House-centric, it is perhaps better with him as the Sun King than, say, Nixon or George W.
Bush.
"At the end of each meeting, the president summarises what everyone has said and the arguments each has made with a
real lawyer's clarity," says a participant to the NSC principals meeting, which includes Mr Gates and Mrs Clinton. "When
the president finally makes a decision, it is with the full facts and usually shows a high calibre of judgment."
When Mr Obama makes a decision, that is.
STATE AND DEFENCE DEPARTMENTS
An 'alliance of the unsackables' finds it can confront the inner circle
If there is a caveat to the depiction of the Obama administration as White House-centric, it is in the
alliance between Hillary Clinton and Robert Gates, the president's secretaries of state and defence.
Mrs Clinton has proved one of the surprises of Barack Obama's tenure, forging a strong working
relationship with her former rival and establishing herself as his chief foreign policy spokesperson
internationally — if not at home, where Mr Obama's inner circle often seems to monopolise the explaining.
Mr Gates, who recently decided to stay for at least another year, is seen as unsackable, not least for the
credibility he lends on issues ranging from missile defence to Guantanamo Bay and Afghanistan. As a
holdover from the Bush administration, his national security bona fides are hard to dispute. It is no
coincidence that Mrs Clinton is probably the only other unsackable cabinet member.
The combination has made itself felt in some of the administration's most significant debates, notably on
Afghanistan, where both successfully urged the deployment of more troops.
"Gates and Clinton happen to like each other, which no one really predicted," says one official, who notes
that while the traditional role of the NSC is to "play referee" between the state and defence departments,
it is as often nowadays a combination of the two against the White House. This is very different from how
it worked when Donald Rumsfeld and Colin Powell held those positions.
"We work together well," Mr Gates said at an appearance with Mrs Clinton on CNN last year. "I think it
starts with, frankly, based on my experience, the secretary of defence being willing to acknowledge that
the secretary of state is the principal spokesperson for United States foreign policy."
Their outlooks often overlap. From the Pentagon, Mr Gates has long called for more US spending on
diplomacy. As chief diplomat, Mrs Clinton has adopted a muscular approach. On Iran, both favour tough
sanctions; on Russia, both have sought to reassure Moscow's neighbours even while improving relations
with the Kremlin.
But for all their workmanlike co-operation, there is no escaping the fact that Mrs Clinton is not part of the
Obama inner circle — a traditionally helpful feature in that job. There is also a constant "residue of friction"
between Mr Obama's and Mrs Clinton's teams, according to insiders. For example, Cheryl Mills, Mrs
Clinton's chief of staff, has had several run-ins with others in the administration.
One official describes Mrs Clinton as "totally loyal" to Mr Obama. He adds: "She and the president are not
the best of friends — how could they be? But she totally respects the presidency — she was married to a
president and she wanted to be one ... She still might be."

Hi!!ary Clinton's "Internet freedom speech iVian
A momentous 40 hours, leading to Clinton/China/Internet
21 Jan 2010 04:12 pm
Apart from two obvious pieces of momentous news in the past day-and-a-half -- the new junior Senator from
Massachusetts, and the new ckv V. V5-
rvi,-
,
,
c.:! (by which I mean today's lamentable, straight-party-line Supreme Court
ruline
;that removes limits from direct corporate underwriting of political campaigns) -- there is one other event today that
will have big ripple effects. i mean SecState Hillary Clinton's speech this morning about "Internet Freedom," mentioned
;:lere and with a prelude discussion
I'm not going to take time for a thorough gloss of the speech. Instead I highly recommend reading the full text, lette, or
watching the official video, .'tere. And for now some of the main points while listening (and noting main points down in real
time with the handy '
uiveaSccibe, pen.)
- In contrast to the dreamy Internet optimism of a decade or so ago -- I'm not naming names, but I remember! -- when
many people imagined that info technology, by itself, would undermine oppression and bring the world together, Clinton
started off with a very astringent reminder that this technology, like others, was neither good or bad in itself and is already
being used in both helpful and destructive ways:
"Amid this unprecedented surge in connectivity, we must also recognize that these technologies are not
an unmitigated blessing. These tools are also being exploited to undermine human progress and political
rights. Just as steel can be used to build hospitals or machine guns, or nuclear power can either energize
a city or destroy it, modern information networks and the technologies they support can be harnessed for
good or for ill. The same networks that help organize movements for freedom also enable al-Qaida to
spew hatred and incite violence against the innocent. And technologies with the potential to open up
access to government and promote transparency can also be hijacked by governments to crush dissent
and deny human rights."
And a very nice pivot out of this section, effective because it's so blunt and plain:
"On their own, new technologies do not take sides in the struggle for freedom and progress, but the
United States does."
- Underscoring the "this is a big deal" tone of the speech, she enumerated the "Four Freedoms" that FDR proclaimed in
1941, as part of the struggle for the world's future, and said there were a comparable set of Four Freedoms for the
Internet age. Check out the speech yourself for details.
- The China surprise: the speech was a more frontal challenge to Chinese internet and overall censorship policy than I
expected, and than I recall in other US-China interactions in a very long time. For instance, early in the speech, an
itemization of the places where suppression is getting worse:
"In the last year, we've seen a spike in threats to the free flow of information. China, Tunisia, and
Uzbekistan have stepped up their censorship of the Internet. In Vietnam, access to popular social
networking sites has suddenly disappeared. And last Friday in Egypt, 30 bloggers and activists were
detained."

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769292 Date: 08/31/2015
Tunisia, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Egypt -- this is not the grouping of countries that the Chinese government, in its recent
sense of rise to superpower status, is used to being lumped with. Compared to the US as a financial power, OK;
overtaking japan in economic size, yes; being a crucial player in environmental negotiations.., all that is one thing.
Bracketed in the same sentence with Tunisia and Uzbekistan is different. Sentences like this don't appear in formal, big-
deal SecState addresses by accident.
Other passages to the same effect:
"As I speak to you today, government censors somewhere are working furiously to erase my words from
the records of history. But history itself has already condemned these tactics....
"Those who disrupt the free flow of information in our society or any other pose a threat to our economy,
our government, and our civil society. Countries or individuals that engage in cyber attacks should face
consequences and international condemnation...."
And then the Google section itself.
I had wondered whether the speech would mention Google by name -- and had reason to think it might not. (Main
argument forleavina it implicit rather than referring directly to the Google case: in the company's ongoing efforts to find a
"il
lvineyiftaiv_in" acceptable way to remain in China, rather than a lose-lose-lose permanent split, its not necessarily a help
to have the U.S. government standing officially by its side. ) But the way Sec. Clinton introduced the point was significant:
as a proxy for China's own ability to H.to,tentiai and sustain its economic rise:
"To use market terminology, a publicly listed company in Tunisia or Vietnam that operates in an
environment of censorship will always trade at a discount relative to an identical firm in a free society. If
corporate decision makers don't have access to global sources of news and information, investors will
have less confidence in their decisions over the long term. Countries that censor news and information
must recognize that from an economic standpoint, there is no distinction between censoring political
speech and commercial speech. If businesses in your nations are denied access to either type of
information, it will inevitably impact on growth.
"Increasingly, U.S. companies are making the issue of internet and information freedom a greater
consideration in their business decisions. I hope that their competitors and foreign governments will pay
close attention to this trend. The most recent situation involving Google has attracted a great deal of
interest. And we look to the Chinese authorities to conduct a thorough review of the cyber intrusions that
led Google to make its announcement. And we also look for that investigation and its results to be
transparent.
"The Internet has already been a source of tremendous progress in China, and it is fabulous. There are
so many people in China now online. But countries that restrict free access to information or violate the
basic rights of internet users risk walling themselves off from the progress of the next century. Now, the
United States and China have different views on this issue, and we intend to address those differences
candidly and consistently in the context of our positive, cooperative, and comprehensive relationship."
There's a lot more in the speech, including about terrorism, disaster relief, religion, etc -- but it's there for the reading.
Back to the to-do list for me now.

Should Foreign Corporations Spend Money on U.S. Political Candidates?
Krista Gesaman
Foreign businesses might be the real winners in Citizens United v. Federal Elections Commission, the landmark case that
allows corporations and unions to spend limitless amounts of money on presidential and congressional political
campaigns. A majority of large businesses are now owned by foreign entities, and this means international corporations
could pour tons of money into the United States political scene, potentially swaying the political climate.
The biggest questions with this ruling is the scope of the term "corporation," says Edward Foley, law professor at the Ohio
State University College of Law and director of the election-law program. Does the high court want this decision to apply
to foreign corporations as well as domestic ones, he ponders? The truth is, the court didn't make a decision one way or
the other.
Foley best explains the potential issues by talking about the electronic, video, and communication giant, Sony. The
corporation is headquartered in Japan, but a large number of its shareholders reside in the United States. In fact, people
can even buy and trade Sony's stock on the New York Stock Exchange. The issue is whether this corporation, with strong
ties to a foreign country and the United States, should be permitted to independently contribute money to presidential and
congressional campaigns.
The court sought to expand First Amendment protection for corporations, but did it really mean to promote the free flow of
ideas from Russian or Chinese corporations, Foley asks? Justice John Pau! Stevens focused on the same concerns in his
dissenting opinion. The majority's position "would appear to afford the same protection to multinational corporations
controlled by foreigners as to individual Americans," he writes.
This afternoon, President Obama asked Congress to "develop a forceful response" to the ruling. But with Congress
juggling so many other important issues, it's unlikely that a change will be made in the immediate future. This could mean
that foreign cash could be supporting political candidates in next year's congressional midterm elections.

Blogging on the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling is more of what we love about the web. It's the kind of typical
collective dissection we have now come to expect but that never really existed before: serious, speculative, arcane, funny,
brilliant, baked, etc. The Sunliaht Foundation b!000inci is predictably good. Paul Blumenthal dips into the multinational
dimension of the new "corporation as full citizen-person" framework, drawing on blogging going on at Neytsweqk and the
CerAer for Pubiic inte'r'.
"Looks like [the Court] might support allowing foreign companies to spend freely in elections in the United States. I guess
this would be the corporate globalization of the U.S. electoral system." So you gotta ask yourself: Who does Hugo Chavez
want for President?
Blumenthal excerpting the Center for Public Integrity:
The Center for Public Integrity looks at this closer and shows what kind of foreign influence we are
looking at:
One prominent examples is CITGO Petroleum Company — once the American-born
Cities Services Company, but purchased in 1990 by the Venezuelan government-owned
Petroieos de Venezuela S.A. The Citizens United ruling could conceivably allow
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who has sharply criticized both of the past two U.S.
presidents, to spend government funds to defeat an American political candidate, just by
having CITGO buy TV ads bashing his target.
And it's not just Chavez. The Saudi government owns Houston's Saudi Refining
Company and half of Motive Enterprises. Lenovo, which bought IBM's PC assets in 2004,
is partially owned by the Chinese government's Chinese Academy of Sciences. And
Singapore's APL Limited operates several U.S. port operations. A weakening of the limit
on corporate giving could mean China, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and any other country
that owns companies that operate in the U.S. could also have significant sway in
American electioneering.
I really can't see Americans being too happy about this.
ha Lithwick reported :rC(' .ate from the Supreme Court as the opinions were being read. She offered this aside:
While Stevens is reading the portion of his concurrence about the "cautious view of corporate power" held
by the framers, I see Justice Thomas chuckle softly.
Was it a disdainful chuckle at the impotence of his colleague? Was it merely a chuckle of disagreement, of good-natured
exasperation? Was it a chuckle at an anachronistic vision of the framers set beside today's modern corporate silicon and
steel behemoths? I doubt he was thinking about Hugo Chavez.

This is from Justice Stevens' dissent in the Citizens United case:
If taken seriously, our colleagues' assumption that the identity of a speaker has no relevance to the Government's ability
to regulate political speech would lead to some remarkable conclusions. Such an assumption would have accorded the
propaganda broadcasts to our troops by "Tokyo Rose" during World War II the same protection as speech by Allied
commanders. More pertinently, it would appear to afford the same protection to multinational corporations controlled by
foreigners as to individual Americans: To do otherwise, after all, could " 'enhance the relative voice' "of some ( i.e. ,
humans) over others ( i.e. , nonhurnans). Ante, at 33 (quoting Buckley, 424 U. S., at 49). aUnder the majority's view, I
suppose it may be a First Arnendrnpnt problem that corporations are not permitted to vote, given that voting is, among
other things, a form of speech.

"Looks like [the Court] might support allowing foreign companies to spend freely
in elections in the United States. I guess this would be the corporate
globalization of the U.S. electoral system." So you gotta ask yourself: Who does
Hugo Chavez want for President?
Blumenthal excerpting the Center for Public Integrity:
<http://coloradoindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Picture-142.png>
The Center for Public Integrity looks at this closer and shows what kind of
foreign influence we are looking at:
One prominent examples is CITGO Petroleum Company — once the
American-born Cities Services Company, but purchased in 1990 by the Venezuelan
government-owned Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. The Citizens United ruling could
conceivably allow Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who has sharply criticized
both of the past two U.S. presidents, to spend government funds to defeat an
American political candidate, just by having CITGO buy TV ads bashing his
target.

And it's not just Chavez. The Saudi government owns Houston's Saudi
Refining Company and half of Motiva Enterprises. Lenovo, which bought IBM's PC
assets in 2004, is partially owned by the Chinese government's Chinese Academy
of Sciences. And Singapore's APL Limited operates several U.S. port operations.
A weakening of the limit on corporate giving could mean China, Saudi Arabia,
Singapore, and any other country that owns companies that operate in the U.S.
could also have significant sway in American electioneering.
I really can't see Americans being too happy about this.
Dahlia Lithwick reported for Slate <http://www.slate.com/id/2242208/> from the
Supreme Court as the opinions were being read. She offered this aside:
While Stevens is reading the portion of his concurrence about the "cautious
view of corporate power" held by the framers, I see Justice Thomas chuckle
softly.
Was it a disdainful chuckle at the impotence of his colleague? Was it merely a
chuckle of disagreement, of good-natured exasperation? Was it a chuckle at an
anachronistic vision of the framers set beside today's modern corporate silicon
and steel behemoths? I doubt he was thinking about Hugo Chavez.

Sidney
On a rainy, gloomy Sunday I write to you in the hope that we will have agreement from Secretary Clinton to accept the
"distinguished Diplomat" award at VMI. I am assured by the Superintendent, General JHB Peay, and the department
head of International Relations/Political Science, Colonel Jim Hentz that the award is hers if she will accept it. This is a
"done deal."
All that is needed for her to receive an official letter from General Peay is for me to know that she will accept the
award. They want to
give her the award this year on a suitable day before graduation in late May. The letter will ask her to address the corps
of cadets in a suitable on post (campus) setting. I would like to see it in Jackson Memorial Hall, a beautiful medieval
revival building. An alternative setting would be the two story atrium in the Marshall Center for Leadership and
Ethics. The award would be presented at the end of the address. Media coverage would be welcomed and
assisted. She would be honored by being the reviewing person at a regimental review of the corps. A suitable dinner
and or luncheon would be arranged.
If this is going to happen it would be a good idea to set the wheels in motion as soon as possible so that the staffs can
work out the details.
Best

The Settlement Freeze That Never Was, And Never Will Be

The Settlement Freeze That Never Was, And Never Will Be
On 07.05.10, By Max Blumenthal

Linda Forsell's June 21 photos of ongoing construction in the Israeli settlement of Har Homa expose the illusion of
Netanyahu's settlement freeze
With the Israeli settlement moratorium scheduled to expire on September 26, the right-wing parties in Israel's coalition
government are exerting maximum pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to block the policy's renewal. "Let's
get rid of the freeze and get back to building," declared Israeli Minister of Public Affairs and the Diaspora Yuli Edelstein on
Israel National Radio yesterday. "It's our land anyway!" (Edelstein lives in the settlement of Neve Daniel).
Back in the US, the former Israel lobbyist and ex-Clinton Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk took to the Washington
Post's op-ed page to praise Netanyahu and Barack Obama for ensuring that "there were zero building starts in the West
Bank settlements."
During the week of June 21, I traveled through the West Bank with Swedish photojournalist Linda Forsell to document
new settlement construction and the settlers' theft of water from Palestinian towns. Forsell took a series of photos at Har
Homa, a massive Israeli settlement towering over the Palestinian town of Beit Sarhour. Her photos show ongoing
construction of hundreds of new settlement units — documents of the settlement freeze sham.

Netanyahu authorized the building of new settlement units just days after he
announced the freeze in November 2009. He attempted to disguise new settlement construction by drawing a false
distinction between the West Bank and "parts of Jerusalem" like Har Homa that actually lie outside 1967 lines. As Israeli
government flack Mark Regev remarked in December 2009, "We've made a clear distinction between the West Bank and
Jerusalem. Jerusalem is our capital and will stay as such." With a few exceptions, Obama allowed this scheme to go
forward.
According to the Washington Post, Obama's meeting with Netanyahu this week will have more to do with reassuring
Jewish Democrats than with halting the wholesale colonization of the West Bank. As the Post's Anne Kornblut reported,
"The White House meeting will not dwell on some of the most difficult time-sensitive issues, including the expiration of a

moratorium on Israeli settlement construction in September." This may mean an end to the settlement freeze, but it was
only an illusion after all.

Are the Mideast Policy Team!
by Leslie H. Gelb
July 7, 2010 I 2:38pm
I ri==IPresident Barack Obama meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval
Office of the White House, July 6, 2010. (Gary Fabiano / Sipa Press) Obama's bow to Netanyahu was
just the latest in a series of disastrous missteps in U.S. policy toward Israel. Leslie H. Gelb on who's to
blame—and how the White House can get back on course.
Whoever advised President Obama to flay Israel publicly until this week should be fired. Only advisers with no experience
in dealing with Israel could have believed that Israeli leaders like Prime Minister Netanyahu would bow to public attacks.
And whoever advised Mr. Obama to kneel rhetorically to Mr. Netanyahu in public on Tuesday should also be fired. The
only thing accomplished by this embarrassing tactic was to put Israel in a position to call the shots on Mideast policy for
the rest of Obama's first term.
The real enemy of a negotiated settlement in the Mideast is not time; it's failure.
Were the culprits the non-foreign policy White House intimates — chief of staff Rahm Emanuel and political honcho David
Axelrod? Axelrod knows nothing about this, and worse, Emanuel thinks he does because he lived in Israel. Was George
Mitchell, the president's Mideast negotiator, the brains behind the foolishness? Surely, he's had enough experience
working with Israelis to know better. Did General James Jones, the National Security Adviser, remain silent, again? And of
course, where was Secretary of State Hillary Clinton? Strangely for someone so adept at pleasing Israel's constituents in
America, she spent a lot of time this past year publicly beating up on Israeli leaders. Has she been led astray by the pro-
Arab contingent of the State Department?
•Martin Indyk: New Hope for Mideast Peace
•Peter Beinart: Netanyahu's Latest Insult Or is the guilty party none other than President Obama himself? The more we
find out about who makes decisions in the White House on every subject from nuclear weapons to coloring of Easter
eggs, it turns out to be the man in the Oval Office himself. He's the expert. He's the decider. He invites everyone to state
his or her piece or peace, then he tells them what to do — and seemingly without question, they do his bidding.
Mr. Obama started his White House tenure from a near-zero base of foreign policy knowledge and no experience in the
Middle East. It was easy enough to guess this blissful state from his earliest decisions. He came out of the box demanding
that Israel agree to suspend construction on the West Bank as a precondition for direct negotiations with the Palestinians.
Anyone who knew anything about this situation surely would have told the president that the chances of Mr. Netanyahu
agreeing to this "proposal" were zero, or minus zero. No Israeli leader, even a dovish one, would ever dream of beginning
negotiations by conceding his major bargaining card. As the teenagers say, what were Obama and his advisers thinking?
And yes, after the Israelis publicly humiliated Vice President Biden during his trip to the Holy Land by announcing they
would start new construction in East Jerusalem, Washington had to respond vehemently. The Israelis had been arrogant
and stupid on this one. They had weakened American power in the region. No U.S. president could let them get away with
it. Clinton and others made strong public statements of criticism, and those were fine. But Mr. Obama then allowed Mr.
Netanyahu to come ahead with his planned visit to D.C. — and publicly humiliated him. The U.S. president let the Israeli
prime minister cool his heels for hours before meeting with him, then wouldn't shake his hand when he departed. There's
no surer way to unite a nation behind its leader, even a controversial one like Netanyahu, than to have a foreign leader
humiliate him.
This brilliant tactic — thought of by Obama's advisers or the president himself — accomplished two things. It stiffened Israeli
backs even further against being conciliatory about starting talks with the Palestinians. The Israeli government was not
about to cave to American pressures. It also galvanized Israeli supporters in the United States — in particular within
conservative parts of the Jewish community and the Republican Party. There went Mr. Obama's support for pressing
Israel even in private.
To top this all off with Tuesday's meeting, full of smiles and the adoption of Israeli-desired language on almost every topic,
only made matters worse. It made the situation look as if the American president had been cowed by Jewish control of

. .
American politics. That certainly pleased American and Israeli hawks, but it did not please others who want to see
genuine progress in Mideast talks.
There is a time and place for Washington to put pressure on Israel. Mr. Obama and his team picked every wrong time and
place. The right occasion to squeeze is when the negotiations have reached the point where both sides have given and
where both must give more to close the deal. Only at that point does pressure make sense. All parties would get a real
shot at peace in return for their concessions.
To be sure, many ask at this point — How do you get to that point? The answer is not to browbeat the parties to scurry to
the negotiating table. That tactic simply never pays off. The answer is to build conditions beyond the negotiating table,
conditions in the political community in both Israel and Palestine, that would support compromises at the table. The British'
pushed the Catholics and Protestants to make concessions year after year, only to fail time and again, only to further
inflame feelings all around and spur greater violence. Finally, London focused on getting Protestant and Catholic women
to form common groups to support compromise. London did as much with various business communities that evolved into
backers of mutual concessions as well. Only then did parties know that they had support for compromises, their
negotiations got somewhere, and they reached agreement. That's what needs to be done between Israel and the
Palestinians.
We hear time and again that the enemy of peace in the Middle East is time, and that time is running out. Perhaps that is
what has caused Mr. Obama and his team to misstep so badly; they think it's a race against the clock. Do something now
or fail. But the real enemy of a negotiated settlement in the Mideast is not time; it's failure. Neither Israel nor the
Palestinians nor the United States can afford to fail again. After yet another failure, it could well result in perpetual
violence.
To set his Arab-Israeli policy on a sensible course, Mr. Obama needs to search for new advisors who know how to get
things done in the Middle East, hire them, and listen to them.

H: fyi, leaked Luntz poll on Bibi policies; and many congrats to Huma! Sid
Below is a transcript from Israeli TV News Channel Ten on a leaked poll taken last week by Frank Luntz. Here's a
summary:
1. 56% of Americans agree with the claim that there is a humanitarian crisis in Gaza;
2. 43% of Americans agree with the claim that people in Gaza are starving;
3. 34% of Americans support the Israeli operation against the Flotilla;
4. 20% of Americans "felt support" for Israel following announcement of easing of Gaza closure.
Frank Luntz analyses Netanyahu's media performance in the flotilla affair
The figures are troubling and worrisome. If that is the situation with our great friend the US, it is easy to imagine the
situation in other, somewhat less sympathetic countries.
Channel Ten TV News, July 1 2010 20:38
Yaacov Eilon (host): Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considered to make an extremely persuasive presentation in
the world press. But a professional analysis by a US expert presented yesterday to his senior aides strongly criticizes him.
Netanyahu's messages on the flotilla caused more harm than good. Our political correspondent Chico Menashe has
obtained the report.
Chico Menashe: Criticism of Prime Minister Netanyahu's current PR messages and Israeli PR in general comes from the
international elite of media consultants and pollsters and from the mouth of Frank Luntz, considered one of the leading
American political consultants, a Republican pollster, a consultant to many governments throughout the world and to
dozens of the biggest corporations in the US. He was asked by the Jewish organization The Israel Project to check the
opinions of the American public on the messages Israel issued to the world during and after the flotilla events. The result
is a harsh document that primarily criticizes the media strategy of the person considered Israel's number one
propagandist in the world, Prime Minister Netanyahu.
Netanyahu: Once again Israel faces hypocrisy and a biased rush to judgment.
Chico Menashe: Every time Israeli speakers begin with accusing the international community, writes Luntz, they
lose their audience. For example, Netanyahu's comments after the flotilla about the world hypocrisy were rejected by
most of the American participants who listened to them. The findings were presented last night to senior members of
Netanyahu's Bureau. Luntz checked the opinions with focus groups, not a poll. He warns of a dangerous slide in the
public opinion of the only country considered pro-Israeli, the U.S. Israel misses simple opportunities to change world
public opinion, he writes, and the consequences are significant. The American public increasingly hesitates to accept
arguments that support Israeli positions.
Ehud Barak: There is no hunger in Gaza and no humanitarian crisis.
Netanyahu: There's no shortage of food, there's no shortage of medicine, there's no shortage of other goods.
Chico Menashe: Luntz says Israel must immediately stop using the argument that there is no hunger and no
humanitarian crisis in Gaza. He says this fatally destroys Israel's credibility in light of the images on the
television screens. Israel must admit that there is a problem, he says, to gain the listeners' sympathy [emphasis
mine]. Luntz finds the troubling figure that 56% of participants agree with the claim that there is a humanitarian crisis in
Gaza, and no less astonishing is that 43% of participants from the American public agree with the claim that people in
Gaza are starving. But even lifting the closure that was supposed to improve Israel's image missed the opportunity,
according to Luntz.
Netanyahu: Yesterday an important decision was made by the security cabinet. Its meaning is clear. On the one hand,
allowing civilian goods into Gaza, and on the other hand maintaining the military blockade of Hamas.
Chico Menashe: The statement by Netanyahu's bureau of lifting the closure missed the opportunity to gain
support in international public opinion [emphasis mine]. Only 20% of the Americans polled felt support of Israel
following the statement. According to Lunt, this is the summary of the flotilla damage in American public opinion: Only
34% of the American public support the Israeli operation against the flotilla, and he says that is a dangerously low
percentage.

Americans Disapproving Obama Poised to Enable
Republican Gains

Chart: Poll Results
Attachment: Poll results and methodology
Americans disapprove of U.S. President Barack Obama's handling of almost every major issue and are
deeply pessimistic about the nation's direction, offering a bullish environment for Republicans in the
November congressional elections.
A majority or plurality disapproves of Obama's management of the economy, health care, the budget
deficit, the overhaul of financial market regulations and the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, according to a
Bloomberg National Poll conducted July 9- 12. In addition, almost 6 in 10 respondents say the war in
Afghanistan is a lost cause.
Almost two-thirds say they feel the nation is headed in the wrong direction, an even more sour
assessment than in March when 58 percent felt that way. Two-thirds of independent voters are
pessimistic, while just 56 percent of Democrats offer a vote of confidence.
"They don't see any solutions in sight," said J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., a Des Moines, Iowa-
based firm that conducted the nationwide survey. "They have been hammered by the economy and there
is a disconnect between the lives Americans are living and Washington. They seem to have lost hope."
Poll respondents are divided on their congressional preference between Democrats and Republicans,
with both sides getting 43 percent support. Among those who say they are most likely to vote,
Republicans are favored, 48 percent to 40 percent. The Republican advantage is even greater among
likely voters who view the election as exceptionally important, with Republicans beating Democrats 56
percent to 34 percent.
Control of Congress

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. CO5769584 Date: 08/31/2015
For the Democrats, whd control Congress and the White House, the survey shows the potential 'for losses
in November, when voters will fill all 435 House seats, 36 Senate seats and 37 governorships. The
outcome could affect °Pam's ability to move his agenda through Congress for the two years leading up
to his own 2012 re-election bid.
The fate of incumbents will depend to some extent on what happens to the economy in the next four
months and whether unemployment drops much from its current 9.5 percent. A rising stock market could
help as well. So far this year, the S&P 500 stock index has declined 1.8 percent.
The public's disenchantment with the president's Policies doesn't extend to voter feelings about Obama
himself, as he gets a job approval rating of 52 percent and personally is viewed favorably by 55 percent.
Obama, 48, remains more popular than any of the Republican figures tested in the poll and is topped only
by Secretary of State :-- ;:!aity ant.cn and General Da,,,td Petraeos, the new commander of U.S. forces in
Afghanistan, among a list of 15 people and political parties reviewed.
Republican Leaders
The only bright spot for Republican candidates is for Louisiana Governor Eiob%) 1i:tele!, who gets a 32
percent favorable rating and an 18 percent unfavorable grade. Better-known party leaders such as former
vice presidential candidate :a-et..n and former House Speaker Netf,ri: CirigPait both have negative
ratings that outweigh the positive views.
Although turnout in midterm elections is historically lower than in presidential races, the electorate is
interested. Four- fifths of Americans who plan to vote say November's election is very or exceptionally
important.
The likelihood to vote is strongest among older voters, Republicans and those with the highest incomes.
Among those 55 and older. three-quarters say they will definitely vote, compared with 48 percent of those
younger than 35. Four-fifths of Republicans say they will definitely vote, compared with 65 percent of
Democrats and 62 percent of independents.
Referendum on °barna
Seeking to capitalize on the intensity expressed by voters, Republicans want to make the election a
national referendum on Obama and the party in power, while the White House and Democrats argue it is
about going forward, rather than backward to failed policies.
The challenge for Democrats will be to translate their vision of a better future into more positive feelings
about the economy among voters. In the poll, Republicans have the advantage among the independents
often critical to winning elections. Among independents likely to vote, Republican congressional
candidates are preferred to Democrats, 50 percent to 29 percent.
"Anything that has been tried hasn't resulted in making anything better in the world where ordinary people
live," Selzer said. "That's a bad scenario for incumbents of the majority party."
Incumbent Disadvantage
A third of poll participants say they would be less likely to vote for a candidate who has served in
Congress for many years. About one-fifth of likely voters say the election is more about sending a
message, while three-quarters say it is about picking the party that has the best ideas.

"I don't know what these people are thinking in Washington," says poll respondent Jeff Lockman, 41, a
professional golfer and Republican from Malvern, Pennsylvania. "They are going in 10 different directions
and they really don't know what to focus on."
The proportion who feel the nation is headed in the wrong direction is about the same as at this poin't in
1994, when Republicans took control of Congress, and 2006, when Democrats took over.
The public also has soured on Obama's foreign-policy priority, the war in Afghanistan. While the president
has ordered an expansion of forces to turn the tide in a conflict where he says the U.S. has a critical stake,
58 percent say it is a lost cause, compared with 36 percent who say it can still be won. A slim majority of
Republicans -- 52 percent -- say the U.S. can still win in Afghanistan, while 71 percent of Democrats say
the conflict is lost.
Afghanistan Withdrawal
Six in 10 Americans say it would be best to stick with Obarna's plan to start withdrawing forces in July
2011, while one-third say they remain open to keeping the same number of troops there, or even adding
additional forces.
Reflecting the belief among many that the war cannot be won, a third of Americans say they have become
less supportive of the effort there in recent months.
The Bloomberg National Poll is based on interviews with 1,004 U.S. adults ages 18 or older. Percentages
based on the full sample may have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.
:4:?,r;yr• '.
3cwrra:1, who studies public opinion at the ,A;-necicar Entarpr:F.:e institute, a public-policy research
group in Washington, cails the poll "very, very grim news for the Democrats."
At the same time, she says, one silver lining for Democrats is that Republicans have yet to convince
voters that they have a plan.
Obarna Visit
One signpost for Democrats in the poll is the finding that just 26 percent of Americans say it would help a
Democratic candidate in their area to get a visit from Obama, while 20 percent say it would hurt the
candidate and 54 percent say it wouldn't matter or they don't know.
Obama's worst ratings are for his handling of the budget deficit, where 59 percent disapprove and 37
percent approve. It's his worst grade for that subject in any of four Bloomberg polls taken since
September 2009. The Obama administration expects a record budget deficit this year of more than $1.5
trillion, or 10.6 percent of GDP, according to projections the White House released in February. It was
$1.4 trillion for the 2008-2009 fiscal year, which covers the end ofGecrge W. Bush's presidency, and
Obama has said that the current fiscal shortfall as well as theunemployment rate are inheritances from his
Republican predecessor's administration.
"My biggest fear is we have people in government who don't have a clue about what is going on in the
economy," says poll respondent Jim Heeter, 66, from Glendale, Arizona. "They have never run a business
or had to make a payroll."
Economy, Health Care

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769584 Date: 08/31/2015
Slim majorities disapprove of Obama's handling of the economy and health care. When it comes to
creating jobs, he gets 46 percent approval, addressing problems on Wall Street, 42 percent support,
running the war in Afghanistan, 46 percent approve, and managing the BP Plc oil spill, 46 percent
support.
Forty-five percent say they have become more supportive in recent months of tougher regulations for Wall
Street. The momentum is heading in the opposite direction from the White House and Democrats on most
other issues.
Almost half say they have become less supportive in recent months of federal money being loaned to
automotive companies to help them stay in business, while 37 percent have become less supportive of
the health-care overhaul passed by Congress earlier this year. A majority, 61 percent, say the nation
should wait and see how the health-care legislation works or leave it alone, while 37 percent want to see it
repealed.
Arizona Immigration Law
Almost half of Americans say they have also grown more supportive of allowing local law enforcement to
detain anyone who can't produce proof of citizenship when stopped for an offense, as is contemplated in
an Arizona law. Cbama has criticized the measure and the Justice Department has announced it plans to
sue Arizona.
At least half of respondents also say they would be less likely to support candidates who voted to give
financial assistance to the banking or automobile industries.
Americans are roughly divided on whether they would be more or less likely to support a candidate who
voted against extending unemployment benefits because of concern over the cost. A measure providing
such support worth $34 billion is stalled in Congress.
Clinton Popularity
The disaffection with Obarna and Democrats doesn't carry over to all Democrats. Hillary Clinton, 62, is
viewed favorably by 61 percent of respondents and a quarter of Americans, including 30 percent of
Republicans and 21 percent of Democrats, say the nation would be in a better place if she had been
elected president.
The Tea Party movement, which has been mainly associated with Republicans, has lukewarm support in
the poll. A majority of 58 percent of all respondents says it would make no difference to them if a
candidate was backed by Tea Party activists, while a third of Republicans say that kind of backing would
make a candidate more appealing to them.
Those who are more likely to think the Tea Party is a simplistic and misguided movement -- 44 percent of
all respondents -- include Democrats, 65 percent, and those with the highest incomes, 52 percent.
Independent voters are divided on whether it is misguided or has rightly identified that the nation would be
better served by reduced federal government, compared with 39 percent overall.

Netanyahu pleased: I didn't capitulate
Ben Caspit, Maariv, May 27 2010 [page 2 with front page lead; Hebrew original here
<http://www.scribd.com/doc/32038200/Maariv-May27-10-Netanyahu-Says-He-Beat-Obama> and at bottom of post] In
the course of intimate conversations over the past few weeks with top political officials and civil servants, Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has said, according to his interlocutors, that he managed to defeat the US administration.
Netanyahu is pleased by the fact that the Americans failed, so he said, to twist his arm and that ultimately, in the duel
between him and the Obama administration, he was the one who emerged with the upper hand. We did not make
concessions on our red lines and they failed to make us fold and to drag us to places we didn't want to go, said
Netanyahu, according to people who heard him speak.
Netanyahu is convinced that he is not going to be forced to extend the settlement construction freeze, which is due to
expire in September. According to senior officials in Jerusalem, an agreement has already been reached with the
administration that the Israeli government will not announce an extension of the construction freeze in the territories,
and the Americans will "make sure" that the Palestinians do not withdraw from the talks. Israel, however, will not take
"aggressive" action and construction will be resumed only in areas that are clearly within the consensus inside the
settlement blocs.
The Prime Minister's Bureau vigorously denied the above report. "The statements attributed to the prime minister are
incorrect," said a spokesman in the Prime Minister's Bureau. "They were not said by Netanyahu in any forum. The
reason is simple: the prime minister does not think that, Prime Minister Netanyahu holds in great esteem the
commitment by President Obama and the administration to Israel's security and their efforts to renew the peace
process in our region."
Eli Bardenstein adds: The formal invitation that Netanyahu received yesterday to meet with President Obama next week
might attest to a radical change in the White House's attitude towards him. Political sources in Israel described the
planned meeting as "the peak of the campaign for Israel and the Jews that has been pursued by the Obama
administration in the past number of weeks." The sources said that the meeting was geared to put an end to the grave
crisis that erupted some two months ago between the Obama administration and Netanyahu over the Israeli-Palestinian

conflict and particularly over the continued construction in East Jerusalem, and to mend the mistaken impression that
was received as if Israel was "no longer an absolute ally of the United States."
That crisis, which was initiated by the Americans, elicited fierce criticism in the United States, and sparked a desire
among members of the Obama administration to rectify the situation. Another reason for the administration's desire to
end the crisis is the fear of failure in the upcoming Congressional elections in November. "The Democratic Party's coffers
are empty. Many Democrat members of Congress and Senators have complained that if the hazing of Israel were to
continue, they would be unable to obtain donations from Jews and were liable to lose the elections," said one source in
Washington.
The prevalent assessment is that Netanyahu will be received far more warmly in Washington next week than he was two
months ago. This time the meeting will be covered by the media and the two leaders are expected to have their picture
taken together and to give statements to the media.
That said, sources in Washington noted that "Netanyahu is leery of the meeting with Obama and of walking into a trap
once again. He knows that the smiles notwithstanding, behind closed doors he is going to have to give answers to very
difficult questions, like 'how do you envision the end of the negotiations with the Palestinians."
Netanyahu is to begin his political travels today in Paris, where he is to attend the ceremony in honor of Israel's
acceptance into the OECD. The prime minister will be arriving in a city that is on strike, which is liable to impede his
movement through the city streets to the center of Paris for his meetings.

Gaza: it's Hamas's move now
Hamas must seize the initiative if there is ever to be an end to Israel's occupation of Palestine
•
•
c) Jeremy Greenstock
o quardian.co.uk, Wednesday 2 June 2010 12.29 BST
So it has happened again. Nearly 18 months after the Israelis bombed Gaza to a wasteland, with barely a load of building
materials allowed in since then, Turkey has taken the brunt of an operation of humanitarian assistance gone wrong.
The UN must establish the facts impartially and independently and, if laws have been broken, those responsible must be
held to account. Political demonstrations posing as relief flotillas go wrong too easily and Israel understandably has to
prevent weapons being smuggled into Gaza. But was this really the best way to bring the ships to shore for examination?
A commando attack on civilian ships looks callous and disproportionate. No one should have been hurt, whatever the
emotions behind all this.
Why is Gaza under siege in the first place? Under international law, the Israelis are responsible as the occupying force for
the proper administration of the territory; and half the point of Israel is not to be above the law. Yet they are creating a
traumatised territory of 1.5m neighbours, many of whose children seem to want to grow up to be suicide bombers. They
are also pouring fertiliser on al-Qaida's ground.
The director of UNRWA operations in Gaza, John Ging, gave a speech in London this week entitled "Illegal, inhuman. and
insane: a medieval siege on Gaza in 2010". This objective humanitarian practitioner should be listened to. How has Israel,
the only democracy in its region and a symbol of the need for racially inspired violence to end, come to risk any claim to
international legitimacy in its handling of this situation?
Hamas are the enemy of Israel, but they do not have to be. They preach violent resistance too readily, yet over the past
17 months they have been trying to control the militant groups intent on threatening Israel with rockets — imperfectly
perhaps, but not a single Israeli citizen has been killed (alas, one immigrant worker was) by a rocket since the Gaza
bombing stopped in January 2009. They are also the implacable opponents of al-Qaida. They won a fair election in 2006
and claim to respect democracy. Let's test them on that. At present, Hamas security people are being sniped at by the
Israeli Defence Forces when they try to arrest other militant groups. This is genuinely getting insane.
The unwisdom of reliance on angry military responses is all the clearer when the mood in Palestine, in both the West
Bank and Gaza, is steadily moving towards a negotiated end to the occupation. I am convinced from my own direct
experience that Hamas is prepared to establish and respect a long-term ceasefire so that the talking can start without the
threat of violence, and that they would enter in good faith, if that were reciprocated, into negotiations to establish two
states in the disputed territories, Israel and Palestine, with their own rights and responsibilities under international law.
The distortion of their position, a little of it the fault of their own PR, does no side any good.
If a comprehensive negotiation is too much to expect for now, what about a first step? I believe an arrangement to end the
blockade is within reach if only Israel, Egypt and Gaza would test the possibilities of dialogue. Hamas have indicated that
they could cease all attacks on Israeli soil, close the tunnels, release Gilead Shalit and stop the import of arms into Gaza if
the blockade was ended, an agreed number of Palestinian prisoners were released and Gaza began to be rebuilt.
The Palestinians of course have work to do on their own internal reconciliation, while the relationship between Fatah in
the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza remains so bad. But the UN, the US, Russia, the EU and the Arab world must make a
much more serious attempt to test the possibilities, putting ordinary Israelis and Palestinians first, not their own political
comfort.
We are coming close to losing the chance of a two-state solution. US policy, based on a West-Bank-only approach, is
locked in a cul-de-sac if Gaza is left out of the equation, because majority Palestinian support will be lacking. Israel is
confident in the knowledge that it cannot be militarily defeated.

But that ignores the huge danger of losing the political, diplomatic, legal and moral high ground. This matters in today's
world, as the US and the UK discovered in Iraq, because government authority and public opinion interact closely, and
legitimacy breeds support.
Israel's relationship with Turkey was the key to a broader understanding with the Islamic community and others beyond
the west. That now lies in tatters. If Israel is left as the permanent occupier, or controlling a one-state structure with part of
its population downgraded or imprisoned, it will truly be a disaster for its people and what they stand for.
I hope that Hamas will not sit back and enjoy Israel's discomfiture. They have so far, for a political organisation, attracted
much too narrow a range of international support. If they wish to be widely accepted as a negotiating partner, they must
unequivocally accept the only fully justified condition set by the international Quartet — the cessation of violence —
underline that their objective is a two-state settlement, and win international friends for the ending of the occupation. In
whoever's hands, bombs, bullets, rockets and iron bars will achieve nothing. But a push for justice will.

on how Turkey thought it was encouraged by Obama in its initiative with Brazil on Iran and then felt the limb

countries in DC. True or not, distorted or accurate, it is what the Arabs believe. Their view is that Obama will
be reelected and there will be no progress at all in the Middle East for six years and they are planning
accordingly—US influence at ebb tide. Did any boys at the NSC encourage the Turks as reported? Better?

America's ties to Israel are not based primarily on U.S. strategic interests. At the best of times, an Israeli
government that pursues the path to peace provides some intelligence, some minor advances in military
technology, and a potential source of stabilizing military power that could help Arab states like Jordan. Even
then, however, any actual Israeli military intervention in an Arab state could prove as destabilizing as
beneficial. The fact is that the real motives behind America's commitment to Israel are moral and ethical. They
are a reaction to the horrors of the Holocaust, to the entire history of Western anti-Semitism, and to the United
States' failure to help German and European Jews during the period before it entered World War II. They are a
product of the fact that Israel is a democracy that shares virtually all of the same values as the United States.
The U.S. commitment to Israel is not one that will be abandoned. The United States has made this repeatedly
clear since it first recognized Israel as a state, and it has steadily strengthened the scale of its commitments since
1967. The United States has provided Israel with massive amounts of economic aid and still provides enough
military assistance to preserve Israel's military superiority over its neighbors. The United States has made it
clear that any U.S. support for Arab-Israeli peace efforts must be based on options that preserve Israel's
security, and its recent announcements that it will consider "extended regional deterrence" are code words for a
U.S. commitment that could guard Israel, as well as its neighbors, against an Iranian nuclear threat.
At the same time, the depth of America's moral commitment does not justify or excuse actions by an Israeli
government that unnecessarily make Israel a strategic liability when it should remain an asset. It does not mean
that the United States should extend support to an Israeli government when that government fails to credibly
pursue peace with its neighbors. It does not mean that the United States has the slightest interest in supporting
Israeli settlements in the West Bank, or that the United States should take a hard-line position on Jerusalem that
would effectively make it a Jewish rather than a mixed city. It does not mean that the United States should be
passive when Israel makes a series of major strategic blunders--such as persisting in the strategic bombing of
Lebanon during the Israeli-Hezbollah conflict, escalating its attack on Gaza long after it had achieved its key
objectives, embarrassing the U.S. president by announcing the expansion of Israeli building programs in east
Jerusalem at a critical moment in U.S. efforts to put Israeli-Palestinian peace talks back on track, or sending
commandos to seize a Turkish ship in a horribly mismanaged effort to halt the "peace flotilla" going to Gaza.
It is time Israel realized that it has obligations to the United States, as well as the United States to Israel, and
that it become far more careful about the extent to which it test the limits of U.S. patience and exploits the
support of American Jews. This does not mean taking a single action that undercuts Israeli security, but it does
mean realizing that Israel should show enough discretion to reflect the fact that it is a tertiary U.S. strategic
interest in a complex and demanding world.
Israel's government should act on the understanding that the long-term nature of the U.S.-Israel strategic
relationship will depend on Israel clearly and actively seeking peace with the Palestinians—the kind of peace
that is in Israel's own strategic interests. Israelis should understand that the United States opposes expansion
and retention of its settlements and its efforts to push Palestinians out of greater Jerusalem. Israeli governments
should plan Israeli military actions that make it clear that Israel will use force only to the level actually required,
that carefully consider humanitarian issues from the start, and that have a clear post-combat plan of action to
limit the political and strategic impact of its use of force. And Israel should not conduct a high-risk attack on
Iran in the face of the clear U.S. "red light" from both the Bush and Obama administrations. Israel should be
sensitive to the fact that its actions directly affect U.S. strategic interests in the Arab and Muslim worlds, and it
must be as sensitive to U.S. strategic concerns as the United States is to those of Israel.
The United States does not need unnecessary problems in one of the most troubled parts of the
world, particularly when Israeli actions take a form that does not serve Israel's own strategic interests. This
Israeli government in particular needs to realize that as strong as U.S.-Israel ties may be, it is time to return to
the kind of strategic realism exemplified by leaders like Yitzhak Rabin. No aspect of what happened this week
off the coast of Gaza can be blamed on Israeli commandos or the Israel Defense Forces. Israel's prime minister
and defense minister had full warning about the situation, and they knew the flotilla was deliberately designed
as a political provocation to capture the attention of the world's media in the most negative way possible. They

The Flotilla Raid Was Not "Bungled." The IDF Detailed Its Violent Strategy In Advance.
On 06.03.10, By Max Blumenthal
Tel Aviv-Israel Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his senior ministers have attempted to blame army
commanders for "the bungled raid on a Gaza-bound flotilla," according to the UK's Daily Telegraph. The AP reported that
"Israel's bloody, bungled takeover of a Gaza-bound Turkish aid vessel is complicating US-led Mideast peace efforts." And
according to Reuters, "Israeli military admits errors in bungled boarding."
But was the raid really bungled? Did the Israeli military command and Netanyahu government have no clear strategy
going in? Or was the violence they meted out against the flotilla activists deliberate and methodically planned?
Statements by senior Israeli military commanders made in the Hebrew media days before the massacre revealed that the
raid was planned over a week in advance by the Israeli military and was personally approved by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Minister of Defense Ehud Barak. The elite Israeli commando unit known as Unit 13 was tasked with
carrying out the mission and its role was known by the Israeli public well before the raid took place. Details of the plan
show that the use of deadly force was authorized and calculated. The massacre of activists should not have been
unexpected.
On May 28, three days before the raid, top Israeli military officials revealed details of their strategy to Maariv, Israel's most
widely circulated paper. The caption of the Maariv article reflected the military command's plan to use force: "On the way
to violence; one of the boats is on its way."
Here is a translation of relevant portions of the article:
Maariv, 5/28/10 P. 4
Title: Head to Head in the Heart of the Sea
Caption: On the way to violence; one of the boats is on its way."
Subhead: The sea encounter that will occur at the end of the weekend is already planned detail by detail. From the
moment that the ships will pass the "red line" on their way to Gaza, the fighters of Unit 13 will take control and transfer 800
passengers from their boats back to where they came from. And special arrest units were set up.
From the body of article: This operation was approved by Prime Minister Netanyahu and Defense Minister Barak and will
be led by the commander of the Navy, Lieutenant Colonel Eliezer Maron, who is nicknamed "Cheney." If the people
aboard the boats will not agree to turn around, the operation will transfer to the stage of force. "We are afraid that
there will be a terror attack by the boats," said a high ranking officer. "If terrorists have gotten on the boats or if there is an

Israeli military that the, saYists might try to repel its commandos once they forced their way on the ships. The plan to
search for "sabbiage materials" also foreshadowed the IDF's post-raid propaganda campaign.
An alternative plan that would have been likely to avert violence could have been set into motion. The Israeli Navy could
have done what it had in the past and hijacked the aid ships without boarding them, then towed them to shore. However,
the Rambo-style plan concocted by Netanyahu, his top aides and the Naval commander with the unfortunate nickname of
"Cheney" made the killing of activists likely, if not inevitable.
Why didn't Israel's leaders choose to deal with the flotilla in a more judicious fashion? Were they that stupid, or just crazy?
From the details of the plan it appears that Netanyahu and his cohorts had envisioned Entebbe Part Deux, a daring anti-
terror raid that would lift the sinking morale of the Israeli public while intimidating Iran and the Arab world. Though Israel
may be more isolated than ever as a result of the massacre, the Netanyahu administration is reaping considerable
political benefits at home.
The day after the massacre, spontaneous celebrations broke out in Ashdod, Tel Aviv, and throughout the country,
bringing together right-wing elements with everyday Israelis. Over a thousand Israelis gathered tonight outside the Turkish
embassy in Tel Aviv to rally against the Turkish government and express their support for the raid. Multiple demonstrators
including one man who has lived in Israel for 60 years told me, "What Turkey [the sponsor of the Mavi Marmara boat] has
done is great. I have never seen this country more united in my entire life. We are all standing together now." (Video
coming soon).
Israeli newscasters are routinely using the term "mechabel," or terrorist, to refer to the flotilla activists, while the violence
that broke out on the deck of the Mavi Marmara is called "the lynch." (Nevermind that zero commandos were hung and
nine activists were killed, including an American citizen who was shot in the head four times.) No evidence is required to
support claims in the Israeli media. The public desperately wants to believe that its government is right, so much so that
Israel's media is not even making a token effort to challenge the increasingly hysterical press releases disseminated by
the IDF press office every few hours.
Hanin Zoabi, a Palestinian-Israeli member of the Knesset who was on the Mavi Marmara, was physically accosted in the
Knesset by fellow legislators for attempting to relate her experience aboard the flotilla. MK Miri Regev of Likud called her a
"traitor," while Yoel Hasson of Kadima, a supposedly centrist party, denounced Zoabi as a "terrorist." An Israeli Facebook
group devoted to inciting Zoabi's assassination has gathered 600 members in just a day and a half. In the meantime,
Israel's Interior Minster Eli Yishai is "looking into" means of stripping Zoabi of her citizenship.
This Friday, anti-occupation activists expect to encounter intense violence from the Israeli Army and Border Police at the
weekly demonstrations in Sheikh Jarrah and Nebi Salah. "In this atmosphere, you can expect with pretty reasonable
certainty that the soldiers Will go crazy," a veteran of the Sheikh Jarrah protest movement told me.
With two more ships on their way towards Gaza with aid for the besieged civilian population, the Israeli military and
Netanyahu administration are not wasting time in hatching a new strategy to stop them. Once again, the plan calls for
violence and possibly more death. "Next time we'll use more force," a top Naval commander told the Jerusalem Post. "We
will have to come prepared in the future as if it was a war."

The U.S. needs to keep nudging Israel on a Gaza fix
By David Ignatius
Friday, June 4,2010; A19
The Obama administration, caught between two allies during this week of crisis, has signaled Israel and Turkey
that the blockade of Gaza should be loosened to allow more humanitarian aid to reach the Palestinian
population there.
From the first news early Monday of the Israeli commando attack on a flotilla of Turkish relief ships, the White
House has been trying to balance the interests of two prickly friends. The immediate aim, said a senior official,
has been to "defuse the electricity of the moment" by freeing the ships' passengers and passing a U.N. resolution
calling (in fuzzy language) for an investigation of the raid.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769651 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769651 Date: 08/31/2015
Beyond crisis management, administration officials have begun to urge Israel to use this incident to untangle the
Gaza mess. U.S. officials hope Israel will take action on its own, before international condemnation grows any
louder or another relief convoy tests the blockade. "The humanitarian aperture is not wide enough," argues the
U.S. official. "We need to convince the Israelis that not everything can be made into a weapon."
The Obama team recognizes that Israel will act in its interests, but it wants Jerusalem to consider U.S. interests,
as well. The administration has communicated at a senior level its fear that the Israelis sometimes "care about
their equities, but not about ours."
This cautionary message -- that Israel must act as a more reliable and responsible partner -- may be the most
important one conveyed this week.
One issue on which the administration believes Israel would benefit from a more farsighted view is the
investigation of the incident. Israel has argued that this is a purely internal matter for the Israeli military, whose
operations to enforce the Gaza blockade were lawful and appropriate.
But by defying calls for an international inquiry, the Israelis will compound their isolation. "They have an
image problem, a perception problem," says the U.S. official. The White House hopes the Israelis will embrace
some mechanism for an international probe -- perhaps a French proposal for an inquiry by the International
Committee of the Red Cross. Such a move would be in Israel's interest, the administration believes.
The trickiest problem in the first hours of the crisis was dealing with Turkey, whose leaders treated the
commando raid as a pirate attack on Turkish citizens. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Gen. Jim
Jones, the national security adviser, met with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu. Then came a lengthy
phone call between President Obama and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Obama told Erdogan that "we need to find a solution" for the Gaza humanitarian problem, according to a U.S.
official. Erdogan is said to have agreed with the president that a good relationship between Israel and Turkey
was crucial for regional stability -- and that Turkey didn't want to see any further degradation.
The Obama administration deserves credit for its repair work in the first days after the Gaza attack. But this is
another example where the administration has been reacting to events that it should have tried better to control.
The Gaza confrontation has been developing for weeks; administration officials reportedly cautioned Israel
about provocative moves, but not emphatically enough to make a difference. U.S. officials were blindsided
about the commando operation partly because they don't spy on a key ally.
Similarly, the Obama White House has been too reactive in its relationship with Turkey. A glaring example of
this diplomatic drift is the Turkish mediation effort with Iran to revive an October plan for enrichment of
uranium abroad. Davutoglu thought he had Obama's blessing for his shuttle diplomacy, and the White House
was given frequent updates. But when Turkey and Brazil announced they had clinched the deal, the
administration did the diplomatic equivalent of shrugging its shoulders -- and went ahead with plans for U.N.
sanctions.
One of the perverse secrets of Middle East diplomacy is the importance of riding several horses at once. In the
heyday of Henry Kissinger's shuttle mediation, the Americans were the supreme masters of playing both sides
of the street.
Obama has been talking about engagement and mediation but without much to show for it. Instead, the
administration has been responding to events rather than driving them. That won't do. As former ambassador
Chas. W. Freeman says in his collection of aphorisms, "The Diplomat's Dictionary": "If you're not at the table,
you're on the menu."

Israel does not need enemies: it has itself. Or more precisely: it has its government. The Netanyahu-Barak
government has somehow found a way to lose the moral high ground, the all-important war for symbols and
meanings, to Hamas. That is quite an accomplishment. Operation Make the World Hate Us, it might have been
called.
I leave it to others to make the operational criticisms of the Israeli action, and will say only that even my
amateurish understanding of the tactical challenge posed by the interdiction of the boats suffices to suggest that
there were other ways to do this. I also will not pretend to a perfect grasp of what happened on board the Mavi
Marmara. I have pondered the videos that both sides have released, and concluded that the Israeli soldiers
sliding down that rope had no intention of attacking the people on board and that the people on board had no
way of being confident of this. I cannot expect Palestinians and their supporters to believe the best about the
Israeli army. (This is what Israeli hardliners call "the restoration of deterrence.") I do not doubt that some of the
activists on the ship welcomed a confrontation with Israel, but the Israelis should not have obliged them. In any
event, what took place on that deck looks to me like a tragic misunderstanding. Yet there was no reason to think
that anything else would have transpired.
The important point is that the killing of civilians on the Mavi Marmara—I understand that they were "armed"
with metal bars and a knife, but still they were civilians, and soldiers are trained to respond unlethally to the
recklessness of a mob—cannot be extenuated by reference to "asymmetrical warfare" and Israel's right to
defend itself. This was not warfare, at least of the physical sort. Israel was not under attack. A headline in The
Washington Post yesterday reported that "Israel says Free Gaza Movement poses threat to Jewish state." Such a
claim is absurd. It is true that the movement has grown in recent years, and is now troublesome to Israel's
policy in Gaza; and it is also true that the Turkish charity that sponsored the "Freedom Flotilla" has ties to
Islamicist groups. But this is hardly what Israel likes to call, in the Iranian context, and there quite plausibly, an
"existential threat." The extension of the definition of a security threat to include hostile activities that have
little or no bearing upon security is an ominous development.
It is also the inevitable consequence of Benjamin Netanyahu's cunning pronouncement last year that Israel is
now endangered by "the Iran threat, the missile threat, and the threat I call the Goldstone threat." The
equivalence was morally misleading, and therefore dangerous. Ideological warfare is not military warfare. I
have studied the entirety of the Goldstone Report, and whereas I do not doubt (and wrote in this magazine in the
days before Goldstone) that Operation Cast Lead caused the unjustifiable death of non-combatants, I also do not
doubt that the Goldstone Report, which was nastily indifferent to Israel's security predicament and to the ethical
challenges of Israeli self-defense, was an instrument in a broad campaign of delegitimation against Israel—and
yet the threat of delegitimation is not like the threat of destruction. It is different in kind. A commando
operation is not an appropriate response to an idea. "This was no Love Boat," Netanyahu said yesterday. "It was
a hate boat." He is right, but so what? The threat of delegitimation is not a military problem and it does not have
a military solution. And the attempt to give it a military solution has now had the awful consequence of making
the threat still greater. The assault on the Mavi Marmara was a stupid gift to the delegitimators.
You do not have to be a general to grasp these distinctions. In fact, judging by Israel's recent history, it might
help not to be one. But the militarization of the Israeli government's understanding of Israel's situation—this
has been the most sterile period for diplomacy in all of Israel's history—is not all that led to the debacle at sea.
Rules of military engagement that allow soldiers to fire on political activists (I leave aside the question of their
humanitarianism for a moment) may signify something still deeper and even more troubling. It is hard not to
conclude from this Israeli action, and also from other Israeli actions in recent years, that the Israeli leadership
simply does not care any longer about what anybody thinks. It does not seem to care about what even the
United States—its only real friend, even in the choppy era of Obama—thinks. This is not defiance, it is despair.
The Israeli leadership seems to have given up any expectation of fairness and sympathy from the world. It is
behaving as if it believes, in the manner of the most perilous Jewish pessimism, that the whole world hates the
Jews, and that is all there is to it. This is the very opposite of the measured and empirical attitude, the search for
strategic opportunity, the enlistment of imagination in the service of ideals and interests, that is required for
statecraft.

The complication—the one that deprives anybody who acknowledges it of membership in any of the gangs of
commentary—is that there is a partial basis in the actually existing world for a degree of Israeli pessimism.
There are leaders, states, organizations, and peoples whose hostility to the Jewish state is irrational and absolute
and in some cases murderous. Things are said critically about Israel that wildly burst the bounds of thoughtful
criticism. The language in which Israel is described by some governments and international organizations is
lurid and grotesque and foul. Anti-Semitic tropes—the conspiracy theory about the Jews, most conspicuously—
are regularly encountered in otherwise respectable places. The analysis of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that
absolves the Palestinians of any significant role in it is widespread. I do not see how any of this can be denied,
or shunted aside, or explained entirely in terms of Israeli behavior. But it is emphatically not the whole picture,
except for those Israelis and Jews whose political interests and ideological inclinations prefer it to be the whole
picture. For there are forces in Israel, and in its government, that have a use for Jewish hopelessness.
There is a verse in Numbers that Jewish pessimists like to cite: "the people shall dwell alone, and not be
reckoned among the nations." It is Balaam's divinely inspired description of the Israelites—Balaam, who came
to curse and stayed to bless. But I have always regarded it as a curse, this promise of loneliness. I have heard it
intoned lachrymosely and proudly—in our time Jewish pride has a disturbingly parasitic relationship with
Jewish lachrymosity—all my life. It chills me to the bone. It is a locution for prophets, not prime ministers. The
Jews cannot dwell alone. In fact, their history shows that they never did dwell alone. It is not a tale of insularity
and isolation. The apartness of the Jews was never a complete secession from their environment. The
engagement of the Jews with the world was a matter not only of practical necessity, but also of theological
conviction. And not even the darkest and most dire adversity succeeded in driving them entirely into
themselves.
When, in the modern era, the Zionists concluded, quite correctly, that the Jews must extract themselves from
anti-Semitic societies and establish a society of their own, a sovereign one, in the land of Israel, it was in part to
"normalize" them by making them "reckoned among the nations," and therefore like other nations. Zionism was
a reversal of Balaam's phony blessing. The state was not supposed to be a bunker, even if it had enemies. But
Netanyahu is a creature of the bunker. He talks about peace, but not like a man who hungers for it. He takes no
steps toward peace except as the consequence of a crisis—a crisis not with the Palestinians but with the
Americans. He liturgically intones his warnings, some of them true, about the external dangers facing Israel,
and mistakes brutishness for toughness, and offers nothing. He is a gray, muddling, reactive figure. His
preferred strategy for his country is: one quiet week after another unto eternity. His problem is that there are not
many quiet weeks.
But about those activists: a great deal of bathetic rubbish has been written about them. Insofar as they were
bringing food and medicine to Gaza, they were humanitarians; but insofar as they were striking a blow for the
government of Gaza, they were anti-humanitarians. A real "Freedom Flotilla" would have sailed for Gaza to
liberate it from its rulers. For Hamas stifles Gaza from within even as Israel stifles it from without. It oppresses
the Palestininans who live under its sway and has brought them ruin. When did it become progressive to support
a theocracy? Consider the case of Henning Mankell, the Swedish writer of thrillers (and the son-in-law of
Ingmar Bergman) who was a passenger on one of the boats in the "Freedom Flotilla." In his youth he took part
in anti-Vietnam and anti-apartheid demonstrations, presumably in the spirit of secular reason. For a while he
lived in Norway and participated in the activities of a radical Maoist party: let us call that secular unreason.
Now he does the work of Hamas and its mullahs. Last year Mankell attended the Palestine Festival of Literature
in east Jerusalem—or would have attended it, if the Israeli authorities had not idiotically closed it down. When
he returned to Sweden, he wrote that "there is a straight line between Soweto, Sharpeville, and what recently
happened [I presume he was referring to the war] in Gaza." And: "Is it strange that some [Palestinians] in pure
desperation, when they cannot see any other way out, decide to become suicide bombers? Not really. Maybe it
is strange that there are not more of them." And: "The state of Israel in its current form has no future. Moreover,
those who advocate a two-state solution have not got it right. ... The question is whether it will be possible to
talk sense into the Israelis in order for them to willingly accept the end of their own apartheid state." This man
has rights, at sea and on land, but he can hardly be lauded as a champion of peace and reconciliation. You are
not for co-existence if you advocate the disappearance of one of the terms. (Consider, analogously, the recent
adventures of Noam Chomsky in the region. It was widely noted that the Israelis, again idiotically, turned him
away at the Allenby Bridge. It was less widely noted that a few days later a reporter for The New York Times

accidentally discovered him in Lebanon at the home of Nabil Qaouk, the deputy head of Hezbollah, which is
not what Voltaire had in mind.)
And yet the screw must be turned again: the anti-Israeli virulence of Henning Mankell and his maritime
comrades does not make Israel's assault on the Mavi Marmara more just or more wise. Now the Israeli
government may find it impossible not to modify or even to lift the blockade of Gaza—an outcome that no
decent person can decry, as long as Hamas does not exploit the respite to acquire weapons or what it needs to
make them, and the past is not encouraging in this regard. Netanyahu will do what he can to get past the mess,
hoping that the approach of the midterm elections in the United States will rescue him from the pressure, and
the deadening hand of the status quo will be back. And Israel will be known to more and more people—in a
wounding misrepresentation—mainly for cruelty.

To the Editor:
Nicholas D. Kristofs column could have been written by the peacemaking Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin or Israel's founder
and first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, if they were alive today.
Mr. Rabin told me shortly before he was assassinated by a right-wing Israeli extremist that Israel, while pursuing peace,
must never play into the hands of Palestinian terrorists, who would try to sabotage the talks with attacks intended to
provoke disproportionate retaliation. Yes, Israel would fight the terrorists, but not the Palestinian people. And it would
certainly not initiate bloody conflict.
Mr. Ben-Gurion told me that Israel would regret maintaining control of Arab-inhabited regions and another people after the
1967 Six-Day War. He said the war would never end as long as Israel occupied the area, an occupation he felt was both
strategically and morally wrong.
And if succeeding right-wing governments had taken his advice, the war might well have been over years ago, preventing
Hamas from ruling Gaza, giving Iran no excuse for threatening Israel with nuclear destruction, and making life much
easier for the United States.
The Israeli assault on the pro-Palestinian flotilla is a symbolic result of the tragic survival-imperiling refutation by Israeli
right-wingers of the visionary views of their country's two greatest leaders.

Re: British election
First and most important: Do NOT, repeat, NOT, call any prospective winner on either Election Night, May 6,
or on the next day, Friday, May 7. The result will be unclear. It will not be clear, even perhaps by Friday
afternoon. Today, the combined polls show Cameron and the Conservatives ahead but not winning an outright
majority. The latest Guardian poll, out tomorrow, shown me by Alan Rusbridger today, has the Tories falling
short of a majority of seats. Even if Cameron were to win an outright majority, Brown and Labour will attempt
to make a deal with Clegg and the Liberal Democrats. Brown remains as Prime Minister unless the Tories win
outright, which take a long time to determine. Labour and the Lib-Dems will almost certainly gain about 60
percent of the vote, more or less. Brown will reach out to Clegg to stay in power. The deal will be that Brown
will approve a referendum on proportional representation giving the LDs much greater representationin future
elections. That will spell the end forever of the Tories ever coming to power. The Tories see the election in
apocalyptic terms—and they are not wrong. Brown's weakness heralds the sort of grand progressive
coalition/alliance that Tony imagined but was never able to attempt between Labour and the LDs. Brown
offering the referendum would be the first step toward that. In the case of the Tories falling short of an outright
majority in seats, they will respond as though Brown is acting illegitimately, which he would not be by
remaining as PM and dealing with Clegg. Informed people are already talking of what might begin to unfold on
Friday as "Florida." The Tories, backed by the Murdoch press, will attempt to push Labour aside by force
majeure—something that will not succeed under those circumstances. The Murdochs are almost literally going
crazy. James Murdoch and hiw wife stormed into the offices of The Independent, not a Murdoch paper, when
the paper endorsed the LDs and confronted the publisher, screaming in the middle of the newsroom. Murdoch
would be a big, big loser if Cameron loses. Another possibile outcome is that the Conservatives come up just
short and attempt their own deal with the DUP to cover the gap in seats. Shaun is on to this potential, has been
talking to Peter Robinson.
No matter what, keep your powder dry until the result is crystal clear. Wait.

The Israeli Media's Flotilla Fail
On 06.22.10, By Max Blumenthal
My summaty of the Israeli media's shambolic performance following the flotilla massacre was originally published here in
Hebrew at Dvorit Shargal's excellent Israeli media blog, Velvet Underground. The English version follows:
If the raid of the Gaza Freedom Flotilla was a disaster for the Israel Defense Forces, its aftermath demonstrated an
equally bewildering performance by the Israeli media. The IDF Spokesman's Office churned out one misleading claim
after another, each one more implausible than the next, seeking to implant in the public's mind a version of events that
bore little relation to reality. To a degree, this was to be expected; but it was startling to see how some of Israel's most
respected reporters lined up to serve as military stenographers, barely challenging the IDF's rapidly changing versions of
events. IDF claims about the flotilla passengers' links to Al Qaida, anti-Semitic statements shouted at the Israeli Navy, and
their terrorist intentions were eagerly broadcast by the Israeli media without a second thought. When independent
reporters forced the IDF to retract or "clarify" all of these claims, Israeli news outlets refused to correct their errors, or
covered them up without acknowledgment.
It so happened that I arrived in Israel for a research trip the day after the flotilla raid. As a result, I was able to do
something which I always thought to be a very basic journalistic practice, so basic it's supposed to be applied routinely:
Asking an implicated party in a story to produce evidence for its claims. What I found bewildering is that at least judging
from Israeli media reports, few, if any, mainstream reporters applied this practice, and when a visiting colleague did their
job for them – nobody bothered to correct or withdraw their original report.
On June 2, the IDF disseminated a press release entitled, "Attackers of the IDF soldiers found to be Al Qaeda
mercenaries." The accusation was not accompanied by any conclusive evidence — the IDF reported that Mavi Marmara
passengers were equipped with night-vision goggles (gasp!). This did not stop Yedioth's Ron Ben-Yishai, who was
embedded with the Navy commandos, from amplifying the baseless charge. Citing an "interrogation" of Marmara
passengers — "lynchers," he called them — Ben-Yishai wrote the same day, "Some among the [flotilla passengers] are
believed to have ties with World Jihad groups, mainly Al Qaeda." The article made no reference to any efforts on part of
Ben Yishai to investigate this claim, nor did he seem to think to ask why the IDF was about to release dangerous
operatives of Osama Bin Laden — presumably they would attack again, wouldn't they? •
On June 3, Israeli journalist Lia Tarachansky of the Real News Network and I placed calls to the IDF Spokesman's Office
to demand further evidence of the Marmara's Al Qaeda ties. We received identical responses from spokespeople from the
IDF's Israel and North America desks: "We don't have any evidence. The press release was based on information from
the National Security Council." Hours later, the IDF retracted its claim, changing the title of its press release to, "Attackers
of IDF Soldiers Found Without Identification Papers." Despite the official retraction, Ben-Yishai's article remains
uncorrected.
On June 4, the IDF released an audio clip purporting to consist of transmissions between the Mavi Marmara and a Naval
warship. "Go back to Aushwitz!" a Marmara passenger shouted, according to the IDF. YNet and Haaretz reported on and
reproduced the audio clip without investigating its authenticity. Forget that the voice uttering the anti-Semitic slur sounded
like a mentally disturbed teenager; had reporters performed a cursory search of the IDF Spokeman's Office website, they
would have found a longer clip released on May 31 that featured a dramatically different exchange with the Marmara with
no mention of Auschwitz. Further, the voice of flotilla organizer Huwaida Arraf was featured in the "Aushwitz" clip, yet Arraf
was not aboard the Marmara (she was on the Challenger One). Could the IDF have doctored audio to exploit public
hysteria surrounding the issue of anti-Semitism?
On my blog, I pointed out the discrepancies in the IDF's footage and raised the question of doctoring. The next day, the
IDF conceded that it had in fact doctored the footage, releasing a "clarification" and a new clip claiming to consist of the
"full" exchange between the Navy and the flotilla. Unfortunately, the authenticity of the new clip was impossible to verify.
Despite the IDF's admission, YNet and Haaretz have not corrected their original reports, though Haaretz has at least
altered its headline. Once the doctoring was exposed, the New York Times covered the episode in detail, directing

international attention to the triumph of independent online reporting and the apparent failure of Israel's parochial press
corps.
On June 7, Haaretz's Anshel Pfeffer reported on an IDF press release claiming without evidence that five flotilla
passengers had links to international terror. The press release was larded with highly implausible claims, including that
Ken O'Keefe, who runs an aid organization with Tony Blair's sister-in-law, was planning to train a Hamas commando unit
in the Gaza Strip. When I called the IDF Spokesman's Office, I learned that once again, no evidence was available to
support their press release. "There is very limited intelligence we can give in this specific case," Sgt. Chen Arad told me.
"Obviously I'm unable to give you more information." Did Pfeffer demand more evidence? If he did and was answered in
the same manner as I did, why did Haaretz publish an unsubstantiated spin as fact?
Joined by Haaretz military correspondents Avi Isacharoff and Amos Harel, Pfeffer became a channel for another daytime
deception by the IDF. On May 31, the three reporters produced an article based exclusively on testimony from Naval
commandos — the flotilla passengers' side of the story was ignored — claiming they had faced live fire and lynching
attempts from Marmara passengers. Since the story was published, the IDF has produced scant evidence to support
either accusation. The article was accompanied by a suspicious photo from the IDF Spokesman's Office depicting a
bearded Muslim man brandishing a knife and surrounded by photojournalists. Daylight beamed in from a window behind
the man. Haaretz's caption, which was sourced to the IDF, asserted that the photo was taken "after" the commandos had
boarded the Marmara. However, the commandos raided the ship at night, while the photo was taken during the day. Once
again, the IDF's story was fishy.
I called Sgt. Arad at the IDF Spokesman's Office to investigate. He told me he had no evidence to support the photo's
questionable caption. Soon after our phone conversation, Haaretz quietly altered the caption, removing its claim that the
photo was taken "after" the commando raid. For nearly a week, the false photo caption had remained intact. Why did
Haaretz suddenly change it? The only plausible explanation is that the paper received a tip from the IDF Spokesman's
Office. If true, the tip-off suggests a scandalous level of coordination between the Israeli military and the country's media.
In the wake of the flotilla raid, Israeli journalists had a unique opportunity to lead the global media's investigation into the
bloodbath that occurred on the deck of the Mavi Marmara. After all, no one had better access to the military or the
eyewitnesses aboard the flotilla. Instead, too many among the Israeli press corps allowed themselves to be conscripted
into the IDF's hapless information war, leaving the important task of investigating the raid to independent reporters who
remembered to view claims by any nation's military with extreme skepticism.
So why do well-connected, experienced reporters follow the IDF baton so willingly, and fail to follow up when IDF claims
are retracted? Is it simple bias, a desire to present their military in the best possible light, a desire so strong they abandon
their duty to their readers to verify their information? Are they afraid of sanctions, of losing contacts and access to
information? Do they fear personal reprisals? Their readers, and the world media that still relies on Israeli journalism as a
vital source of information, need to know.

'Howed I get screwed into going to this dinner?" demands Gen. Stanley McChrystal. It's a Thursday night in mid-April,
and the commander of all U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan is sitting in a four-star suite at the HOtel Westminster in
Paris. He's in France to sell his new war strategy to our NATO allies — to keep up the fiction, in essence, that we actually
have allies. Since McChrystal took over a year ago, the Afghan war has become the exclusive property of the United
States. Opposition to the war has already toppled the Dutch government, forced the resignation of Germany's president
and sparked both Canada and the Netherlands to announce the withdrawal of their 4,500 troops. McChrystal is in Paris to
keep the French, who have lost more than 40 soldiers in Afghanistan, from going all wobbly on him.
"The dinner comes with the position, sir," says his chief of staff, Col. Charlie Flynn.
McChrystal turns sharply in his chair.
"Hey, Charlie," he asks, "does this come with the position?"
McChrystal gives him the middle finger.
The general stands and looks around the suite that his traveling staff of 10 has converted into a full-scale operations
center. The tables are crowded with silver Panasonic Toughbooks, and blue cables crisscross the hotel's thick carpet,
hooked up to satellite dishes to provide encrypted phone and e-mail communications. Dressed in off-the-rack civilian
casual — blue tie, button-down shirt, dress slacks — McChrystal is way out of his comfort zone. Paris, as one of his
advisers says, is the "most anti-McChrystal city you can imagine." The general hates fancy restaurants, rejecting any
place with candles on the tables as too "Gucci." He prefers Bud Light Lime (his favorite beer) to Bordeaux, Talladega
Nights (his favorite movie) to Jean-Luc Godard. Besides, the public eye has never been a place where McChrystal felt
comfortable: Before President Obama put him in charge of the war in Afghanistan, he spent five years running the
Pentagon's most secretive black ops.
"What's the update on the Kandahar bombing?" McChrystal asks Flynn. The city has been rocked by two massive car
bombs in the past day alone, calling into question the general's assurances that he can wrest it from the Taliban.
"We have two KIAs, but that hasn't been confirmed," Flynn says.
McChrystal takes a final look around the suite. At 55, he is gaunt and lean, not unlike an older version of Christian Bale in
Rescue Dawn. His slate-blue eyes have the unsettling ability to drill down when they lock on you. If you've fucked up or
disappointed him, they can destroy your soul without the need for him to raise his voice.
"I'd rather have my ass kicked by a roomful of people than go out to this dinner," McChrystal says.
He pauses a beat.
"Unfortunately," he adds, "no one in this room could do it."
With that, he's out the door.
"Who's he going to dinner with?" I ask one of his aides.
"Some French minister," the aide tells me. "It's fucking gay."

The next morning, McChrystal and his team gather to prepare for a speech he is giving at the Ecole Militaire, a French
military academy. The general prides himself on being sharper and ballsier than anyone else, but his brashness comes
with a price: Although McChrystal has been in charge of the war for only a year, in that short time he has managed to piss
off almost everyone with a stake in the conflict. Last fall, during the question-and-answer session following a speech he
gave in London, McChrystal dismissed the counterterrorism strategy being advocated by Vice President Joe Biden as
"shortsighted," saying it would lead to a state of "Chaos-istan." The remarks earned him a smackdown from the president
himself, who summoned the general to a terse private meeting aboard Air Force One. The message to McChrystal
seemed clear: Shut the fuck up, and keep a lower profile
Now, flipping through printout cards of his speech in Paris, McChrystal wonders aloud what Biden question he might get
today, and how he should respond. "I never know what's going to pop out until I'm up there, that's the problem," he says.
Then, unable to help themselves, he and his staff imagine the general dismissing the vice president with a good one-
liner.
"Are you asking about Vice President Biden?" McChrystal says with a laugh. "Who's that?"
"Biden?" suggests a top adviser. "Did you say: Bite Me?"
When Barack Obama entered the Oval Office, he immediately set out to deliver on his most important campaign
promise on foreign policy: to refocus the war in Afghanistan on what led us to invade in the first place. "I want the
American people to understand," he announced in March 2009. "We have a clear and focused goal: to disrupt, dismantle
and defeat Al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan." He ordered another 21,000 troops to Kabul, the largest increase since
the war began in 2001. Taking the advice of both the Pentagon and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he also fired Gen. David
McKiernan — then the U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan — and replaced him with a man he didn't know and had
met only briefly: Gen. Stanley McChrystal. It was the first time a top general had been relieved from duty during wartime in
more than 50 years, since Harry Truman fired Gen. Douglas MacArthur at the height of the Korean War.
Even though he had voted for Obama, McChrystal and his new commander in chief failed from the outset to connect. The
general first encountered Obama a week after he took office, when the president met with a dozen senior military officials
in a room at the Pentagon known as the Tank. According to sources familiar with the meeting, McChrystal thought Obama
looked "uncomfortable and intimidated" by the roomful of military brass. Their first one-on-one meeting took place in the
Oval Office four months later, after McChrystal got the Afghanistan job, and it didn't go much better. "It was a 10-minute
photo op," says an adviser to McChrystal. "Obama clearly didn't know anything about him, who he was. Here's the guy
who's going to run his fucking war, but he didn't seem very engaged. The Boss was pretty disappointed."
From the start, McChrystal was determined to place his personal stamp on Afghanistan, to use it as a laboratory for a
controversial military strategy known as counterinsurgency. COIN, as the theory is known, is the new gospel of the
Pentagon brass, a doctrine that attempts to square the military's preference for high-tech violence with the demands of
fighting protracted wars in failed states. COIN calls for sending huge numbers of ground troops to not only destroy the
enemy, but to live among the civilian population and slowly rebuild, or build from scratch, another nation's government — a
process that even its staunchest advocates admit requires years, if not decades, to achieve. The theory essentially
rebrands the military, expanding its authority (and its funding) to encompass the diplomatic and political sides of warfare:
Think the Green Berets as an armed Peace Corps. In 2006, after Gen. David Petraeus beta-tested the theory during his
"surge" in Iraq, it quickly gained a hardcore following of think-tankers, journalists, military officers and civilian officials.
Nicknamed "COINdinistas" for their cultish zeal, this influential cadre believed the doctrine would be the perfect solution
for Afghanistan. All they needed was a general with enough charisma and political savvy to implement it.
As McChrystal leaned on Obama to ramp up the war, he did it with the same fearlessness he used to track down terrorists
in Iraq: Figure out how your enemy operates, be faster and more ruthless than everybody else, then take the fuckers out.
After arriving in Afghanistan last June, the general conducted his own policy review, ordered up by Defense Secretary
Robert Gates. The now-infamous report was leaked to the press, and its conclusion was dire: If we didn't send another
40,000 troops — swelling the number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan by nearly half — we were in danger of "mission failure."
The White House was furious. McChrystal, they felt, was trying to bully Obama, opening him up to charges of being weak
on national security unless he did what the general wanted. It was Obama versus the Pentagon, and the Pentagon was
determined to kick the president's ass.
Last fall, with his top general calling for more troops, Obama launched a three-month review to re-evaluate the strategy in
Afghanistan. "I found that time painful," McChrystal tells me in one of several lengthy interviews. "I was selling an
unsellable position." For the general, it was a crash course in Beltway politics — a battle that pitted him against
experienced Washington insiders like Vice President Biden, who argued that a prolonged counterinsurgency campaign in
Afghanistan would plunge America into a military quagmire without weakening international terrorist networks. "The entire
COIN strategy is a fraud perpetuated on the American people," says Douglas Macgregor, a retired colonel and leading
critic of counterinsurgency who attended West Point with McChrystal. "The idea that we are going to spend a trillion
dollars to reshape the culture of the Islamic world is utter nonsense.
In the end, however, McChrystal got almost exactly what he wanted. On December 1st, in a speech at West Point, the
president laid out all the reasons why fighting the war in Afghanistan is a bad idea: It's expensive; we're in an economic
crisis; a decade-long commitment would sap American power; Al Qaeda has shifted its base of operations to Pakistan.

Then, without ever using the words "victory" or "win," Obama announced that he would send an additional 30,000 troops
to Afghanistan, almost as many as McChrystal had requested. The president had thrown his weight, however hesitantly,
behind the counterinsurgency crowd.
Today, as McChrystal gears up for an offensive in southern Afghanistan, the prospects for any kind of success look bleak.
In June, the death toll for U.S. troops passed 1,000, and the number of IEDs has doubled. Spending hundreds of billions
of dollars on the fifth-poorest country on earth has failed to win over the civilian population, whose attitude toward U.S.
troops ranges from intensely wary to openly hostile. Thetiggest military operation of the year — a ferocious offensive that
began in February to retake the southern town of Marja — continues to drag on, prompting McChrystal himself to refer to it
as a "bleeding ulcer." In June, Afghanistan officially outpaced Vietnam as the longest war in American history — and
Obama has quietly begun to back away from the deadline he set for withdrawing U.S. troops in July of next year. The
president finds himself stuck in something even more insane than a quagmire: a quagmire he knowingly walked into, even
though it's precisely the kind of gigantic, mind-numbing, multigenerational nation-building project he explicitly said he
didn't want.
Even those who support McChrystal and his strategy of counterinsurgency know that whatever the general manages to
accomplish in Afghanistan, it's going to look more like Vietnam than Desert Storm. "It's not going to look like a win, smell
like a win or taste like a win," says Maj. Gen. Bill Mayville, who serves as chief of operations for McChrystal. "This is going
to end in an argument."
The night after his speech in Paris, McChrystal and his staff head to Kitty O'Shea's, an Irish pub catering to tourists,
around the corner from the hotel. His wife, Annie, has joined him for a rare visit: Since the Iraq War began in 2003, she
has seen her husband less than 30 days a year. Though it is his and Annie's 33rd wedding anniversary, McChrystal has
invited his inner circle along for dinner and drinks at the "least Gucci" place his staff could find. His wife isn't surprised.
"He once took me to a Jack in the Box when I was dressed in formalwear," she says with a laugh.
The general's staff is a handpicked collection of killers, spies, geniuses, patriots, political operators and outright maniacs.
There's a former head of British Special Forces, two Navy Seals, an Afghan Special Forces commando, a lawyer, two
fighter pilots and at least two dozen combat veterans and counterinsurgency experts. They jokingly refer to themselves as
Team America, taking the name from the South Park-esque sendup of military cluelessness, and they pride themselves
on their can-do attitude and their disdain for authority. After arriving in Kabul last summer, Team America set about
changing the culture of the International Security Assistance Force, as the NATO-led mission is known. (U.S. soldiers had
taken to deriding ISAF as short for "I Suck at Fighting" or "In Sandals and Flip-Flops.") McChrystal banned alcohol on
base, kicked out Burger King and other symbols of American excess, expanded the morning briefing to include thousands
of officers and refashioned the command center into a Situational Awareness Room, a free-flowing information hub
modeled after Mayor Mike Bloomberg's offices in New York. He also set a manic pace for his staff, becoming legendary
for sleeping four hours a night, running seven miles each morning, and eating one meal a day. (In the month I spend
around the general, I witness him eating only once.) It's a kind of superhuman narrative that has built up around him, a
staple in almost every media profile, as if the ability to go without sleep and food translates into the possibility of a man
single-handedly winning the war.
By midnight at Kitty O'Shea's, much of Team America is completely shitfaced. Two officers do an Irish jig mixed with steps
from a traditional Afghan wedding dance, while McChrystal's top advisers lock arms and sing a slurred song of their own
invention."Afghanistan!" they bellow."Afghanistan!" They call it their Afghanistan song.
McChrystal steps away from the circle, observing his team. "All these men," he tells me. "I'd die for them. And they'd die
for me."
The assembled men may look and sound like a bunch of combat veterans letting off steam, but in fact this tight-knit group
represents the most powerful force shaping U.S. policy in Afghanistan. While McChrystal and his men are in indisputable
command of all military aspects of the war, there is no equivalent position on the diplomatic or political side. Instead, an
assortment of administration players compete over the Afghan portfolio: U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry, Special
Representative to Afghanistan Richard Holbrooke, National Security Advisor Jim Jones and Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton, not to mention 40 or so other coalition ambassadors and a host of talking heads who try to insert themselves into
the mess, from John Kerry to John McCain. This diplomatic incoherence has effectively allowed McChrystal's team to call
the shots and hampered efforts to build a stable and credible government in Afghanistan. "It jeopardizes the mission,"
says Stephen Biddle, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who supports McChrystal. "The military cannot
by itself create governance reform."
Part of the problem is structural: The Defense Department budget exceeds $600 billion a year, while the State
Department receives only $50 billion. But part of the problem is personal: In private, Team McChrystal likes to talk shit
about many of Obama's top people on the diplomatic side. One aide calls Jim Jones, a retired four-star general and
veteran of the Cold War, a "clown" who remains "stuck in 1985." Politicians like McCain and Kerry, says another aide,
"turn up, have a meeting with Karzai, criticize him at the airport press conference, then get back for the Sunday talk
shows. Frankly, it's not very helpful." Only Hillary Clinton receives good reviews from McChrystal's inner circle. "Hillary
had Stan's back during the strategic review," says an adviser. "She said, 'If Stan wants it, give him what he needs.'"
McChrystal reserves special skepticism for Holbrooke, the official in charge of reintegrating the Taliban. "The Boss says
he's like a wounded animal," says a member of the general's team. "Holbrooke keeps hearing rumors that he's going to

get fired, so that makes him dangerous. He's a brilliant guy, but he just comes in, pulls on a lever, whatever he can grasp
onto. But this is COIN, and you can't just have someone yanking on shit."
At one point on his trip to Paris, McChrystal checks his BlackBerry. "Oh, not another e-mail from Holbrooke," he groans. "I
don't even want to open it." He clicks on the message and reads the salutation out loud, then stuffs the BladkBerry back in
his pocket, not bothering to conceal his annoyance.
"Make sure you don't get any of that on your leg," an aide jokes, referring to the e-mail.
By far the most crucial — and strained — relationship is between McChrystal and Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador.
According to those close to the two men, Eikenberry — a retired three-star general who served in Afghanistan in 2002 and
2005 — can't stand that his former subordinate is now calling the shots. He's also furious that McChrystal, backed by
NATO's allies, refused to put Eikenberry in the pivotal role of viceroy in Afghanistan, which would have made him the
diplomatic equivalent of the general. The job instead went to British Ambassador Mark Sedwill — a move that effectively
increased McChrystal's influence over diplomacy by shutting out a powerful rival. "In reality, that position needs to be filled
by an American for it to have weight," says a U.S. official familiar with the negotiations.
The relationship was further strained in January, when a classified cable that Eikenberry wrote was leaked to The New
York Times. The cable was as scathing as it was prescient. The ambassador offered a brutal critique of McChrystal's
strategy, dismissed President Hamid Karzai as "not an adequate strategic partner," and cast doubt on whether the
counterinsurgency plan would be "sufficient" to deal with Al Qaeda. "We will become more deeply engaged here with no
way to extricate ourselves," Eikenberry warned, "short of allowing the country to descend again into lawlessness and
chaos."
McChrystal and his team were blindsided by the cable. "I like Karl, I've known him for years, but they'd never said
anything like that to us before," says McChrystal, who adds that he felt "betrayed" by the leak. "Here's one that covers his
flank for the history books. Now if we fail, they can say, 'I told you so.'"
The most striking example of McChrystal's usurpation of diplomatic policy is his handling of Karzai. It is McChrystal, not
diplomats like Eikenberry or Holbrooke, who enjoys the best relationship with the man America is relying on to lead
Afghanistan. The doctrine of counterinsurgency requires a credible government, and since Karzai is not considered
credible by his own people, McChrystal has worked hard to make him so. Over the past few months, he has accompanied
the president on more than 10 trips around the country, standing beside him at political meetings, or shuras, in Kandahar.
In February, the day before the doomed offensive in Marja, McChrystal even drove over to the president's palace to get
him to sign off on what would be the largest military operation of the year. Karzai's staff, however, insisted that the
president was sleeping off a cold and could not be disturbed. After several hours of haggling, McChrystal finally enlisted
the aid of Afghanistan's defense minister, who persuaded Karzai's people to wake the president from his nap.
This is one of the central flaws with McChrystal's counterinsurgency strategy: The need to build a credible government
puts us at the mercy of whatever tin-pot leader we've backed — a danger that Eikenberry explicitly warned about in his
cable. Even Team McChrystal privately acknowledges that Karzai is a less-than-ideal partner. "He's been locked up in his
palace the past year," laments one of the general's top advisers. At times, Karzai himself has actively undermined
McChrystal's desire to put him in charge. During a recent visit to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Karzai met three U.S.
soldiers who had been wounded in Uruzgan province. "General," he called out to McChrystal, "I didn't even know we were
fighting in Uruzgan!"
Growing up as a military brat, McChrystal exhibited the mixture of brilliance and cockiness that would follow him
throughout his career. His father fought in Korea and Vietnam, retiring as a two-star general, and his four brothers all
joined the armed services. Moving around to different bases, McChrystal took solace in baseball, a sport in which he
made no pretense of hiding his superiority: In Little League, he would call out strikes to the crowd before whipping a
fastball down the middle.
McChrystal entered West Point in 1972, when the U.S. military was close to its all-time low in popularity. His class was the
last to graduate before the academy started to admit women. The "Prison on the Hudson," as it was known then, was a
potent mix of testosterone, hooliganism and reactionary patriotism. Cadets repeatedly trashed the mess hall in food fights,
and birthdays were celebrated with a tradition called "rat fucking," which often left the birthday boy outside in the snow or
mud, covered in shaving cream. "It was pretty out of control," says Lt. Gen. David Barno, a classmate who went on to
serve as the top commander in Afghanistan from 2003 to 2005. The class, filled with what Barno calls "huge talent" and
"wild-eyed teenagers with a strong sense of idealism," also produced Gen. Ray Odierno, the current commander of U.S.
forces in Iraq.
The son of a general, McChrystal was also a ringleader of the campus dissidents — a dual role that taught him how to
thrive in a rigid, top-down environment while thumbing his nose at authority every chance he got. He accumulated more
than 100 hours of demerits for drinking, partying and insubordination — a record that his classmates boasted made him a
"century man." One classmate, who asked not to be named, recalls finding McChrystal passed out in the shower after
downing a case of beer he had hidden under the sink. The troublemaking almost got him kicked out, and he spent hours
subjected to forced marches in the Area, a paved courtyard where unruly cadets were disciplined. "I'd come visit, and I'd

end up spending most of my time in the library, while Stan was in the Area," recalls Annie, who began dating McChrystal
in 1973.
McChrystal wound up ranking 298 out of a class of 855, a serious underachievement for a man widely regarded as
brilliant. His most compelling work was extracurricular: As managing editor of The Pointer, the West Point literary
magazine, McChrystal wrote seven short stories that eerily foreshadow many of the issues he would confront in his
career. In one tale, a fictional officer complains about the difficulty of training foreign troops to fight; in another, a 19-year-
old soldier kills a boy he mistakes for a terrorist. In "Brinkman's Note," a piece of suspense fiction, the unnamed narrator
appears to be trying to stop a plot to assassinate the president. It turns out, however, that the narrator himself is the
assassin, and he's able to infiltrate the White House: "The President strode in smiling. From the right coat pocket of the
raincoat I carried, I slowly drew forth my 32-caliber pistol. In Brinkman's failure, I had succeeded."
After graduation, 2nd Lt. Stanley McChrystal entered an Army that was all but broken in the wake of Vietnam. "We really
felt we were a peacetime generation," he recalls. "There was the Gulf War, but even that didn't feel like that big of a deal."
So McChrystal spent his career where the action was: He enrolled in Special Forces school and became a regimental
commander of the 3rd Ranger Battalion in 1986. It was a dangerous position, even in peacetime — nearly two dozen
Rangers were killed in training accidents during the Eighties. It was also an unorthodox career path: Most soldiers who
want to climb the ranks to general don't go into the Rangers. Displaying a penchant for transforming systems he considers
outdated, McChrystal set out to revolutionize the training regime for the Rangers. He introduced mixed martial arts,
required every soldier to qualify with night-vision goggles on the rifle range and forced troops to build up their endurance
with weekly marches involving heavy backpacks.
In the late 1990s, McChrystal shrewdly improved his inside game, spending a year at Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government and then at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he co-authored a treatise on the merits and drawbacks
of humanitarian interventionism. But as he moved up through the ranks, McChrystal relied on the skills he had learned as
a troublemaking kid at West Point: knowing precisely how far he could go in a rigid military hierarchy without getting
tossed out. Being a highly intelligent badass, he discovered, could take you far — especially in the political chaos that
followed September 11th. "He was very focused," says Annie. "Even as a young officer he seemed to know what he
wanted to do. I don't think his personality has changed in all these years."
By some accounts, McChrystal's career should have been over at least two times by now. As Pentagon spokesman
during the invasion of Iraq, the general seemed more like a White House mouthpiece than an up-and-coming commander
with a reputation for speaking his mind. When Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld made his infamous "stuff happens"
remark during the looting of Baghdad, McChrystal backed him up. A few days later, he echoed the president's Mission
Accomplished gaffe by insisting that major combat operations in Iraq were over. But it was during his next stint —
overseeing the military's most elite units, including the Rangers, Navy Seals and Delta Force — that McChrystal took part
in a cover-up that would have destroyed the career of a lesser man.
After Cpl. Pat Tillman, the former-NFL-star-turned-Ranger, was accidentally killed by his own troops in Afghanistan in April
2004, McChrystal took an active role in creating the impression that Tillman had died at the hands of Taliban fighters. He
signed off on a falsified recommendation for a Silver Star that suggested Tillman had been killed by enemy fire.
(McChrystal would later claim he didn't read the recommendation closely enough — a strange excuse for a commander
known for his laserlike attention to minute details.) A week later, McChrystal sent a memo up the chain of command,
specifically warning that President Bush should avoid mentioning the cause of Tillman's death. "If the circumstances of
Corporal Tillman's death become public," he wrote, it could cause "public embarrassment" for the president.
"The false narrative, which McChrystal clearly helped construct, diminished Pat's true actions," wrote Tillman's mother,
Mary, in her book Boots on the Ground by Dusk. McChrystal got away with it, she added, because he was the "golden
boy" of Rumsfeld and Bush, who loved his willingness to get things done, even if it included bending the rules or skipping
the chain of command. Nine days after Tillman's death, McChrystal was promoted to major general.
Two years later, in 2006, McChrystal was tainted by a scandal involving detainee abuse and torture at Camp Nama in
Iraq. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, prisoners at the camp were subjected to a now-familiar litany of
abuse: stress positions, being dragged naked through the mud. McChrystal was not disciplined in the scandal, even
though an interrogator at the camp reported seeing him inspect the prison multiple times. But the experience was so
unsettling to McChrystal that he tried to prevent detainee operations from being placed under his command in
Afghanistan, viewing them as a "political swamp," according to a U.S. official. In May 2009, as McChrystal prepared for
his confirmation hearings, his staff prepared him for hard questions about Camp Nama and the Tillman cover-up. But the
scandals barely made a ripple in Congress, and McChrystal was soon on his way back to Kabul to run the war in
Afghanistan.
The media, to a large extent, have also given McChrystal a pass on both controversies. Where Gen. Petraeus is kind of a
dweeb, a teacher's pet with a Ranger's tab, McChrystal is a snake-eating rebel, a "Jedi" commander, as Newsweek called
him. He didn't care when his teenage son came home with blue hair and a mohawk. He speaks his mind with a candor
rare for a high-ranking official. He asks for opinions, and seems genuinely interested in the response. He gets briefings on
his iPod and listens to books on tape. He carries a custom-made set of nunchucks in his convoy engraved with his name
and four stars, and his itinerary often bears a fresh quote from Bruce Lee. ("There are no limits. There are only plateaus,
and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them.") He went out on dozens of nighttime raids during his time in Iraq,
unprecedented for a top commander, and turned up on missions unannounced, with almost no entourage. "The fucking

lads love Stan McChrystal," says a British officer who serves in Kabul. "You'd be out in Somewhere, Iraq, and someone
would take a knee beside you, and a corporal would be like 'Who the fuck is that?' And it's fucking Stan McChrystal."
It doesn't hurt that McChrystal was also extremely successful as head of the Joint Special Operations Command, the elite
forces that carry out the government's darkest ops. During the Iraq surge, his team killed and captured thousands of
insurgents, including Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq. "JSOC was a killing machine," says Maj. Gen.
Mayville, his chief of operations. McChrystal was also open to new ways of killing. He systematically mapped out terrorist
networks, targeting specific insurgents and hunting them down — often with the help of cyberfreaks traditionally shunned
by the military. "The Boss would find the 24-year-old kid with a nose ring, with some fucking brilliant degree from MIT,
sitting in the corner with 16 computer monitors humming," says a Special Forces commando who worked with McChrystal
in Iraq and now serves on his staff in Kabul. "He'd say, 'Hey — you fucking muscleheads couldn't find lunch without help.
You got to work together with these guys.'"
Even in his new role as America's leading evangelist for counterinsurgency, McChrystal retains the deep-seated instincts
of a terrorist hunter. To put pressure on the Taliban, he has upped the number of Special Forces units in Afghanistan from
four to 19. "You better be out there hitting four or five targets tonight," McChrystal will tell a Navy Seal he sees in the
hallway at headquarters. Then he'll add, "I'm going to have to scold you in the morning for it, though." In fact, the general
frequently finds himself apologizing for the disastrous consequences of counterinsurgency. In the first four months of this
year, NATO forces killed some 90 civilians, up 76 percent from the same period in 2009 — a record that has created
tremendous resentment among the very population that COIN theory is intent on winning over. In February, a Special
Forces night raid ended in the deaths of two pregnant Afghan women and allegations of a cover-up, and in April, protests
erupted in Kandahar after U.S. forces accidentally shot up a bus, killing five Afghans. "We've shot an amazing number of
people," McChrystal recently conceded.
Despite the tragedies and miscues, McChrystal has issued some of the strictest directives to avoid civilian casualties that
the U.S. military has ever encountered in a war zone. It's "insurgent math," as he calls it — for every innocent person you
kill, you create 10 new enemies. He has ordered convoys to curtail their reckless driving, put restrictions on the use of air
power and severely limited night raids. He regularly apologizes to Hamid Karzai when civilians are killed, and berates
commanders responsible for civilian deaths. "For a while," says one U.S. official, "the most dangerous place to be in
Afghanistan was in front of McChrystal after a 'civ cas' incident." The ISAF command has even discussed ways to make
not killing into something you can win an award for: There's talk of creating a new medal for "courageous restraint," a
buzzword that's unlikely to gain much traction in the gung-ho culture of the U.S. military.
But however strategic they may be, McChrystal's new marching orders have caused an intense backlash among his own
troops. Being told to hold their fire, soldiers complain, puts them in greater danger. "Bottom line?" says a former Special
Forces operator who has spent years in Iraq and Afghanistan. "I would love to kick McChrystal in the nuts. His rules of
engagement put soldiers' lives in even greater danger. Every real soldier will tell you the same thing."
In March, McChrystal traveled to Combat Outpost JFM — a small encampment on the outskirts of Kandahar — to confront
such accusations from the troops directly. It was a typically bold move by the general. Only two days earlier, he had
received an e-mail from Israel Arroyo, a 25-year-old staff sergeant who asked McChrystal to go on a mission with his unit.
"I am writing because it was said you don't care about the troops and have made it harder to defend ourselves," Arroyo
wrote.
Within hours, McChrystal responded personally: "I'm saddened by the accusation that I don't care about soldiers, as it is
something I suspect any soldier takes both personally and professionally — at least I do. But I know perceptions depend
upon your perspective at the time, and I respect that every soldier's view is his own." Then he showed up at Arroyo's
outpost and went on a foot patrol with the troops — not some bullshit photo-op stroll through a market, but a real live
operation in a dangerous war zone.
Six weeks later, just before McChrystal returned from Paris, the general received another e-mail from Arroyo. A 23-year-
old corporal named Michael Ingram — one of the soldiers McChrystal had gone on patrol with — had been killed by an IED
a day earlier. It was the third man the 25-member platoon had lost in a year, and Arroyo was writing to see if the general
would attend Ingram's memorial service. "He started to look up to you," Arroyo wrote. McChrystal said he would try to
make it down to pay his respects as soon as possible.
The night before the general is scheduled to visit Sgt. Arroyo's platoon for the memorial, I arrive at Combat Outpost JFM
to speak with the soldiers he had gone on patrol with. JFM is a small encampment, ringed by high blast walls and guard
towers. Almost all of the soldiers here have been on repeated combat tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and have seen
some of the worst fighting of both wars. But they are especially angered by Ingram's death. His commanders had
repeatedly requested permission to tear down the house where Ingram was killed, noting that it was often used as a
combat position by the Taliban. But due to McChrystal's new restrictions to avoid upsetting civilians, the request had been
denied. "These were abandoned houses," fumes Staff Sgt. Kennith Hicks. "Nobody was coming back to live in them."
One soldier shows me the list of new regulations the platoon was given. "Patrol only in areas that you are reasonably
certain that you will not have to defend yourselves with lethal force," the laminated card reads. For a soldier who has
traveled halfway around the world to fight, that's like telling a cop he should only patrol in areas where he knows he won't
have to make arrests. "Does that make any fucking sense?" asks Pfc. Jared Pautsch. "We should just drop a fucking
bomb on this place. You sit and ask yourself: What are we doing here?"
The rules handed out here are not what McChrystal intended — they've been distorted as they passed through the chain of
command — but knowing that does nothing to lessen the anger of troops on the ground. "Fuck, when I came over here and

heard that McChrystal was in charge, I thought we would get our fucking gun on," says Hicks, who has served three tours
of combat. "I get COIN. I get all that. McChrystal comes here, explains it, it makes sense. But then he goes away on his
bird, and by the time his directives get passed down to us through Big Army, they're all fucked up — either because
somebody is trying to cover their ass, or because they just don't understand it themselves. But we're fucking losing this
thing."
McChrystal and his team show up the next day. Underneath a tent, the general has a 45-minute discussion with some two
dozen soldiers. The atmosphere is tense. "I ask you what's going on in your world, and I think it's important for you all to
understand the big picture as well," McChrystal begins. "How's the company doing? You guys feeling sorry for
yourselves? Anybody? Anybody feel like you're losing?" McChrystal says.
"Sir, some of the guys here, sir, think we're losing, sir," says Hicks.
McChrystal nods. "Strength is leading when you just don't want to lead," he tells the men. "You're leading by example.
That's what we do. Particularly when it's really, really hard, and it hurts inside." Then he spends 20 minutes talking about
counterinsurgency, diagramming his concepts and principles on a whiteboard. He makes COIN seem like common sense,
but he's careful not to bullshit the men. "We are knee-deep in the decisive year," he tells them. The Taliban, he insists, no
longer has the initiative — "but I don't think we do, either." It's similar to the talk he gave in Paris, but it's not winning any
hearts and minds among the soldiers. "This is the philosophical part that works with think tanks," McChrystal tries to joke.
"But it doesn't get the same reception from infantry companies."
During the question-and-answer period, the frustration boils over. The soldiers complain about not being allowed to use
lethal force, about watching insurgents they detain be freed for lack of evidence. They want to be able to fight — like they
did in Iraq, like they had in Afghanistan before McChrystal. 'We aren't putting fear into the Taliban," one soldier says.
"Winning hearts and minds in COIN is a coldblooded thing," McChrystal says, citing an oft-repeated maxim that you can't
kill your way out of Afghanistan. "The Russians killed 1 million Afghans, and that didn't work."
"I'm not saying go out and kill everybody, sir," the soldier persists. "You say we've stopped the momentum of the
insurgency. I don't believe that's true in this area. The more we pull back, the more we restrain ourselves, the stronger it's
getting."
"I agree with you," McChrystal says. "In this area, we've not made progress, probably. You have to show strength here,
you have to use fire. What I'm telling you is, fire costs you. What do you want to do? You want to wipe the population out
here and resettle it?"
A soldier complains that under the rules, any insurgent who doesn't have a weapon is immediately assumed to be a
civilian. "That's the way this game is," McChrystal says. "It's complex. I can't just decide: It's shirts and skins, and we'll kill
all the shirts."
As the discussion ends, McChrystal seems to sense that he hasn't succeeded at easing the men's anger. He makes one
last-ditch effort to reach them, acknowledging the death of Cpl. Ingram. "There's no way I can make that easier," he tells
them. "No way I can pretend it won't hurt. No way I can tell you not to feel that. . . . I will tell you, you're doing a great job.
Don't let the frustration get to you." The session ends with no clapping, and no real resolution. McChrystal may have sold
President Obama on counterinsurgency, but many of his own men aren't buying it.
When it comes to Afghanistan, history is not on McChrystal's side. The only foreign invader to have any success here
was Genghis Khan — and he wasn't hampered by things like human rights, economic development and press scrutiny.
The COIN doctrine, bizarrely, draws inspiration from some of the biggest Western military embarrassments in recent
memory: France's nasty war in Algeria (lost in 1962) and the American misadventure in Vietnam (lost in 1975).
McChrystal, like other advocates of COIN, readily acknowledges that counterinsurgency campaigns are inherently messy,
expensive and easy to lose. "Even Afghans are confused by Afghanistan," he says. But even if he somehow manages to
succeed, after years of bloody fighting with Afghan kids who pose no threat to the U.S. homeland, the war will do little to
shut down Al Qaeda, which has shifted its operations to Pakistan. Dispatching 150,000 troops to build new schools,
roads, mosques and water-treatment facilities around Kandahar is like trying to stop the drug war in Mexico by occupying
Arkansas and building Baptist churches in Little Rock. "It's all very cynical, politically," says Marc Sageman, a former CIA
case officer who has extensive experience in the region. "Afghanistan is not in our vital interest — there's nothing for us
there."
In mid-May, two weeks after visiting the troops in Kandahar, McChrystal travels to the White House for a high-level visit by
Hamid Karzai. It is a triumphant moment for the general, one that demonstrates he is very much in command — both in
Kabul and in Washington. In the East Room, which is packed with journalists and dignitaries, President Obama sings the
praises of Karzai. The two leaders talk about how great their relationship is, about the pain they feel over civilian
casualties. They mention the word "progress" 16 times in under an hour. But there is no mention of victory. Still, the •
session represents the most forceful commitment that Obama has made to McChrystal's strategy in months. "There is no
denying the progress that the Afghan people have made in recent years — in education, in health care and economic
development," the president says. "As I saw in the lights across Kabul when I landed — lights that would not have been
visible just a few years earlier."
It is a disconcerting observation for Obama to make. During the worst years in Iraq, when the Bush administration had no
real progress to point to, officials used to offer up the exact same evidence of success. "It was one of our first
impressions," one GOP official said in 2006, after landing in Baghdad at the height of the sectarian violence. "So many
lights shining brightly." So it is to the language of the Iraq War that the Obama administration has turned — talk of

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769954 Date: 08/31/2015
progress, of city lights, of metrics like health care and education. Rhetoric that just a few years ago they would have
mocked. "They are trying to manipulate perceptions because there is no definition of victory — because victory is not even
defined or recognizable," says Celeste Ward, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation who served as a political
adviser to U.S. commanders in Iraq in 2006. "That's the game we're in right now. What we need, for strategic purposes, is
to create the perception that we didn't get run off. The facts on the ground are not great, and are not going to become
great in the near future."
But facts on the ground, as history has proven, offer little deterrent to a military determined to stay the course. Even those
closest to McChrystal know that the rising anti-war sentiment at home doesn't begin to reflect how deeply fucked up things
are in Afghanistan. "If Americans pulled back and started paying attention to this war, it would become even less popular,"
a senior adviser to McChrystal says. Such realism, however, doesn't prevent advocates of counterinsurgency from
dreaming big: Instead of beginning to withdraw troops next year, as Obama promised, the military hopes to ramp up its
counterinsurgency campaign even further. "There's a possibility we could ask for another surge of U.S. forces next
summer if we see success here," a senior military official in Kabul tells me.
Back in Afghanistan, less than a month after the White House meeting with Karzai and all the talk of "progress,"
McChrystal is hit by the biggest blow to his vision of counterinsurgency. Since last year, the Pentagon had been planning
to launch a major military operation this summer in Kandahar, the country's second-largest city and the Taliban's original
home base. It was supposed to be a decisive turning point in the war — the primary reason for the troop surge that
McChrystal wrested from Obama late last year. But on June 10th, acknowledging that the military still needs to lay more
groundwork, the general announced that he is postponing the offensive until the fall. Rather than one big battle, like
Fallujah or Ramadi, U.S. troops will implement what McChrystal calls a "rising tide of security." The Afghan police and
army will enter Kandahar to attempt to seize control of neighborhoods, while the U.S. pours $90 million of aid into the city
to win over the civilian population.
Even proponents of counterinsurgency are hard-pressed to explain the new plan. "This isn't a classic operation," says a
U.S. military official. "It's not going to be Black Hawk Down. There aren't going to be doors kicked in." Other U.S. officials
insist that doors are going to be kicked in, but that it's going to be a kinder, gentler offensive than the disaster in Marja.
"The Taliban have a jackboot on the city," says a military official. "We have to remove them, but we have to do it in a way
that doesn't alienate the population." When Vice President Biden was briefed on the new plan in the Oval Office, insiders
say he was shocked to see how much it mirrored the more gradual plan of counterterrorism that he advocated last fall.
"This looks like CT-plus!" he said, according to U.S. officials familiar with the meeting.
Whatever the nature of the new plan, the delay underscores the fundamental flaws of counterinsurgency. After nine years
of war, the Taliban simply remains too strongly entrenched for the U.S. military to openly attack. The very people that
COIN seeks to win over — the Afghan people — do not want us there. Our supposed ally, President Karzai, used his
influence to delay the offensive, and the massive influx of aid championed by McChrystal is likely only to make things
worse. "Throwing money at the problem exacerbates the problem," says Andrew Wilder, an expert at Tufts University who
has studied the effect of aid in southern Afghanistan. "A tsunami of cash fuels corruption, delegitimizes the government
and creates an environment where we're picking winners and losers" — a process that fuels resentment and hostility
among the civilian population. So far, counterinsurgency has succeeded only in creating a never-ending demand for the
primary product supplied by the military: perpetual war. There is a reason that President Obama studiously avoids using
the word "victory" when he talks about Afghanistan. Winning, it would seem, is not really possible. Not even with
Stanley McChrystal in charge.

Bill Clinton to U.S. soccer team: "You are amazing!"
By Joe Conason
•
AP/Michael Sohn
Former President Bill Clinton at the World Cup group C soccer match between the United States and Algeria in Pretoria,
South Africa on Wednesday
Salon's Joe Conason is traveling with Bill Clinton in Africa this week and was with the former president at today's U.S.
World Cup soccer game in Pretoria. He filed this report:
Minutes after Landon Donovan scored the stunning extra-time goal that won a critical World Cup match against Algeria,
Bill Clinton and several of his aides and friends (including former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry
McAuliffe) were escorted downstairs to the U.S. team's locker room. The American players roared with pride as the former
president (and honorary chairman of the committee bidding to bring the World Cup to the U.S. in 2018 or 2022) walked in.
After a round of embraces, handshakes and high fives, he spoke briefly about his joy in their victory: "I'm proud of you
because you didn't let the frustration of all the shots that you almost made get you down. You are amazing!"
Much posing for pictures ensued with the shirtless, whooping, chest-bumping players -- who couldn't quite seem to
believe they had done it.
The team then invited Clinton alone to join them in the inner locker room, where he could be glimpsed toasting them with
a beer amid much additional hollering. When he emerged 10 minutes or so later, he had a broad smile and a hoarse
voice.
As Clinton left for Johannesburg, where he will meet tomorrow with former President Nelson Mandela, one of the players
chased him out into the hall and handed one of the former president's aides an official ball signed by all the members of
Team USA.
Clinton stopped for just a moment to talk with the local press before disappearing in a convoy of flashing lights and sirens.
"If it hadn't been the decisive game, even I would have said it should have been a tie," he said. "It was a great game. You
know, all great contests become head games at some point -- sports, elections, wars. And they [Team USA] have good
heads and good hearts."

I was in Kyrgyzstan from June 1 – 6, during which time I met with almost all the members of the interim
government, with special focus on foreign relations, security and legal issues. Here are major points that
emerged from my visit:
1. Crisis in the South. Although I departed before the pogroms had commenced in Osh, I found that the
interim government fully expected violence to break out there but did not anticipate the inter-ethnic
element. Several candidly acknowledged that the government's grip on the south, particularly Osh and
Djalalabad provinces, was extremely tenuous. They said they had severe "loyalty" problems with key figures in
the police and military. When I pressed on what they meant by "loyalty," I was told that the Bakiyev family
had "its people" in key positions in the police and army and that they had intercepted communications between

Re: UK politics/economy
1. UK polls show support for the Lib-Dems after the launch of the draconian Cameron
government budget cratering. LD support is down to 16 percent, half what it was at its
peak during the election and half of LD members now express a desire to defect from
their party. They feel deceived by LD ministers' participation in a Tory budget opposed
to their own beliefs. In Parliament, a secret caucus of LDs is meeting with Labour about
opposing the budget. Meanwhile, short term support for Cameron is static and for the
government slightly up, but only translated to the Tories. Both the Tories and Labour are
up, profiting from the LD quandary. The scenario is potentially portentous for the LD
Party: There was once an influential Australian Liberal Democratic Party, holding 11
percent of the vote and the balance of power in the Australian Senate. Upon reaching its
zenith in 1996 the ALDP supported a Liberal (that is to say, a conservative)
government's budget and suffered collapse. Today the ALDP holds 1 percent of the seats
in the lower House. The political effect of the conservative budget will almost certainly
lead to an implosion of the Tory-LD coalition. In the short run it's possible the Tories
will emerge having the greatest plurality of support. But if their budget does not produce
prosperity they will pay the price, too. See Stiglitz's analysis below on the Tory budget
with cold analysis of the US predicament.
2. The implications for US-UK cooperation are apparent. While there are spheres that
remain, they are contingent, including the Afghanistan War, opposed by 75 percent of
UK public and about which Cameron felt compelled this week to declare UK engagement
would end in five years (that is, before the next UK election). On economic policy, the
UK is no partner and no bridge to Europe, where the Merkel government has entered a
fugue state of vertigo (another subject). At no other time since World War II have the US
and UK governments been at such odds over international economics. With JFK and
Macmillan, Macmillan accepted the postwar Keynesian consensus. Reagan and Thatcher,
of course, were of one mind ideologically, and the international economy was buoyed by
Reagan's hyper-Keynesianism masked as Thatcherism. Unfortunately, Obama did not
reach out to Brown, who sought to reestablish the special relationship around

international economic recovery. Speaking of laissez faire, Cameron must be let alone to
receive the consequences (within 18 months) of his ideologically driven economics. Can
he be engaged on international development? Or does his budget rule that out too?
There's not much there.
3. The Labour Party leadership contest is heating up. David Miliband has an article out
today on how the Camerfin budget will foster "a lost generation." More on that soon...

Osborne's first Budget? It's wrong,
wrong, wrong!
Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel prizewinner who predicted the global crisis, delivers his verdict on the
Chancellor's first Budget and tells Paul Vallely it will take the UK deeper into recession and hit millions —
the poorest — badly
Sunday, 27 June 2010
George Osborne will probably not be very bothered that there is a man who thinks he got last week's
emergency Budget almost entirely wrong. But he should be. Because that man is a former chief
economist at the World Bank who won the Nobel Prize for Economics for his work on why markets do not
produce the outcomes which, in theory, they ought to.
Professor Joseph Stiglitz, who has been described as the biggest brain in economics, is distinctly
unimpressed by George Osborne's strategy. This, he predicts, will make Britain's recovery from recession
longer, slower and harder than it needs to be. The rise in VAT could even tip us into a double-dip
recession.
Stiglitz, who was once Bill Clinton's senior economic adviser, is now professor of economics and finance
at Columbia Business School. He was in the UK this week at the University of Manchester, where he
chairs the Brooks World Poverty Institute, but he lifted his head from the detail of international
development to scrutinise the economic strategy of the Conservative Chancellor whose Liberal Democrat
partners recently reversed their judgement that massive public spending cuts now would endanger the
economy and joined in the Tory slash-and-burn strategy. They were deeply wrong to do so, he believes.
It would be a mistake to ignore Stiglitz on this. He has a track record of getting his predictions right. He
was one of the few economists who predicted the global financial meltdown long before it occurred.
'What happened was very much in accord with what I expected," he tells me when we meet for a coffee
outside the Blackwell bookshop in the centre of the university. "The data was pretty clear about that." And
the scale of the crash? "That wasn't a surprise," he adds, in a matter-of-fact manner. "The bigger the
bubble, the bigger the burst.
"The thing most economists did not fully grasp was the extent to which the banks engaged in murky risk-
taking activities. They were taking a risk with our money, their shareholders' money, the bond-holders'
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770025 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770025 Date: 08/31/2015
money," he says. Banks were demanding up to 40 per cent of the corporate profits, saying their
innovative financing was adding value. But "all this talk about innovation was a sham" because it did not
relate to any real increase in the economy's productivity, he says.
"There was a prima facie case of something screwy going on [with all the] perverse incentives that would
lead them to take excessive risk. But there was no way anyone could know or believe that the banks were
[conducting themselves] at that level of stupidity. I predicted that there was going to be a collapse
because of the information asymmetry problems that were being created." His Nobel prize was given for
exactly that — showing how markets fail because different people in them hold different levels of
information.
Yet there is no hint of l-told-you-so about Stiglitz's tone as he asks the waiter for coffee. He orders
decaffeinated, but suggests the British economy needs the opposite: a stiff stimulant rather than the
"fiscal consolidation" which is George Osborne's economic euphemism for cuts.
Fiscal stimulus is out of fashion now. World leaders embarked on that strategy — injecting money to re-
energise the economy — after the banking crash three years ago. It was widely perceived not to have
worked because the money governments pumped into the banks was not passed on to ailing businesses
or individuals in trouble with their mortgages.
"The problem was that, in the US, the stimulus wasn't big enough," he says. "Too much of it was in tax
cuts. And when they gave money to the banks they gave it to the wrong banks and, as a result, credit has
not been restored — we can expect a couple of million or more homes to be repossessed this year than
last year — and the economy has not been restarted." Instead of producing a consensus that the
government should have done more, it has created disillusion that the government can do anything,
Stiglitz says.
The result is that, following the attacks by the financial markets on Greece and then Spain, everybody is
now in a mood of retrenchment. "It's not just pre-Keynesian, it's Hooverite," he says. By which he means
governments are not just refusing to stimulate, they are making cuts, as Herbert Hoover did in the US in
1929 — when he turned the Wall Street Crash into the Great Depression. "Hoover had this idea that,
whenever you go into recession, deficits grow, so he decided to go for cuts — which is what the foolish
financial markets that got us into this trouble in the first place now want."
It has become the new received wisdom throughout Europe. But it is the classic error made by those who
confuse a household's economics with those of a national economy.
"If you have a household that can't pay its debts, you tell it to cut back on spending to free up the cash to
pay the debts. But in a national economy, if you cut back on your spending, then economic activity goes
down, nobody invests, the amount of tax you take goes down, the amount you pay out in unemployment
benefits goes up — and you don't have enough money to pay your debts.
"The old story is still true: you cut expenditures and the economy goes down. We have lots of
experiments which show this, thanks to Herbert Hoover and the IMF," he adds. The IMF imposed that
mistaken policy in Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, Argentina and hosts of other developing countries in the
1980s and 1990s. "So we know what will happen: economies will get weaker, investment will get stymied
and it's a downward vicious spiral. How far down we don't know — it could be a Japanese malaise. Japan
did an experiment just like this in 1997; just as it was recovering, it raised VAT and went into another
recession."
Then why have we not learned from all that? Because politicians like George Osborne are driven by
ideology; the national deficit is an excuse to shrink the state because that is what he wanted anyway.
Because the financial market only cares about one thing — getting repaid. And because other European

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770025 Date: 08/31/2015
governments are panicking because of the market's wild attack on Greece and Spain, and they don't want
to be next.
"But cutbacks in Germany, Britain and France will mean all of Europe will suffer. The cuts will all feed
back negatively. And if everyone follows this policy, their budget deficits will get worse, so they will have
to make more cuts and raise taxes more. It's a vicious downward spiral. We're now looking at a long,
hard, slow recovery with the possibility of a double dip if everybody cuts back at the same time. The best
scenario is long and hard ... and the worst is much worse. If any one of these countries is forced into
default, the banking system is so highly leveraged that it could cause real problems. This is really risky,
really scary."
So what should we be doing? "The lesson is not that you cut back spending, but that you redirect it. You
cut out the war in Afghanistan. You cut a couple of hundred billion dollars of wasteful military expenditure.
You cut out oil subsidies. There's a long list of things we can cut. But you increase spending in other
areas, such as research and development, infrastructure, education" — areas where government can get
a good return on the investment of public money. "I haven't done the calculation for Britain, but, for the
US, all you need is a return on government investment of 5 to 6 per cent and the long-term deficit debt is
lowered."
Taxes also need to be restructured. Osborne has increased capital gains tax for high earners from 18 to
28 per cent. "There's absolutely no reason why you couldn't tax speculative gains [from rising house or
land prices] by 40 per cent. There's no social return on it and land is going to be there whether people
have speculated or not. But you lower the tax on investment in things like R&D."
Stiglitz has one more practical solution to offer. Governments should set up their own banks to restart
lending to businesses and save struggling homeowners from repossession. "If the banks aren't lending,
let's create a new lending facility to do that job," he says. "In the US, we gave $700bn to the banks; if we
had used a fraction of that to create a new bank, we could have financed all the lending that was
needed."
Indeed, it could be done for far less. "Take $100bn, lever that at 10 to 1 [by attracting funds from the
private sector] and that's a trillion-dollar new lending capacity — more than the real economy needs."
Such a move would help ordinary people more than all Osborne's rhetoric about being tough but fair.
Stiglitz is sceptical, too, about the moral underpinning of a Budget which claims that "we are all in this
together", but then hits the poorest hardest.
Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies has suggested that the Chancellor's Budget will cost the poor
2.5 per cent of their income, while the rich will lose just 1 per cent. "I've not made an independent study
on that point, but cuts in public services will have a disproportionate effect on the poor," Stiglitz says.
Osborne's Budget "may be well-intentioned, but it takes an enormous amount of work to make sure that a
package of public spending cuts of that magnitude doesn't hit the poor disproportionately".
His big fear is that overseas aid, which has been protected in this first round of cuts, will not escape a
second. "Developing countries have redirected themselves towards Asia, and China in particular, in
recent years, so growth in Africa will be more robust than one might have expected, given the severity of
the downturn," he says.
Even so, aid remains vital to poor countries. "If aid is cut back, growth will be badly affected," he says.
"China is providing aid, but its aid is all in infrastructure, whereas aid from the US and Europe is mainly in
education and health — areas in which ordinary people will suffer most if there are cuts."
Joseph Stiglitz has come full circle. What the world needs now — developing and developed — is not
retrenchment but greater economic stimulus. It is not a message many are in the mood to hear. But they

Re: UK politics/economy
UK polls show support for the Lib-Dems after the launch of the draconian Cameron government budget
cratering. LD support is down to 16 percent, half what it was at its peak during the election and half of
LD members now express a desire to defect from their party. They feel deceived by LD ministers'
participation in a Tory budget opposed to their own beliefs. In Parliament, a secret caucus of LDs is
meeting with Labour about opposing the budget. Meanwhile, short term support for Cameron is static
and for the government slightly up, but only translated to the Tories. Both the Tories and Labour are up,
profiting from the LD quandary. The scenario is potentially portentous for the LD Party: There was once
an influential Australian Liberal Democratic Party, holding 11 percent of the vote and the balance of
power in the Australian Senate. Upon reaching its zenith in 1996 the ALDP supported a Liberal (that is
to say, a conservative) government's budget and suffered collapse. Today the ALDP holds 1 percent of
the seats in the lower House. The political effect of the conservative budget will almost certainly lead to
an implosion of the Tory-LD coalition. In the short run it's possible the Tories will emerge having the
greatest plurality of support. But if their budget does not produce prosperity they will pay the price, too.
See Stiglitz's analysis below on the Tory budget with cold analysis of the US predicament.
The implications for US-UK cooperation are apparent. While there are spheres that remain, they are
contingent, including the Afghanistan War, opposed by 75 percent of UK public and about which
Cameron felt compelled this week to declare UK engagement would end in five years (that is, before the
next UK election). On economic policy, the UK is no partner and no bridge to Europe, where the Merkel
government has entered a fugue state of vertigo (another subject). At no other time since World War II
have the US and UK governments been at such odds over international economics. With JFK and
Macmillan, Macmillan accepted the postwar Keynesian consensus. Reagan and Thatcher, of course,
were of one mind ideologically, and the international economy was buoyed by Reagan's hyper-
Keynesianism masked as Thatcherism. Unfortunately, Obama did not reach out to Brown, who sought to

Cameron must be let alone to receive the consequences (within 18 months) of his ideologically driven
economics. Can he be engaged on international development? Or does his budget rule that out too?

Osborne's first Budget? It's wrong, wrong,
wrong!
Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel prizewinner who predicted the global crisis, delivers his verdict on the Chancellor's first Budget
and tells Paul Vallely it will take the UK deeper into recession and hit millions — the poorest — badly
Sunday, 27 June 2010
George Osborne will probably not be very bothered that there is a man who thinks he got last week's emergency Budget
almost entirely wrong. But he should be. Because that man is a former chief economist at the World Bank who won the
Nobel Prize for Economics for his work on why markets do not produce the outcomes which, in theory, they ought to.
Professor Joseph Stiglitz, who has been described as the biggest brain in economics, is distinctly unimpressed by George
Osborne's strategy. This, he predicts, will make Britain's recovery from recession longer, slower and harder than it needs
to be. The rise in VAT could even tip us into a double-dip recession.
Stiglitz, who was once Bill Clinton's senior economic adviser, is now professor of economics and finance at Columbia
Business School. He was in the UK this week at the University of Manchester, where he chairs the Brooks World Poverty
Institute, but he lifted his head from the detail of international development to scrutinise the economic strategy of the
Conservative Chancellor whose Liberal Democrat partners recently reversed their judgement that massive public
spending cuts now would endanger the economy and joined in the Tory slash-and-burn strategy. They were deeply wrong
to do so, he believes.
It would be a mistake to ignore Stiglitz on this. He has a track record of getting his predictions right. He was one of the few
economists who predicted the global financial meltdown long before it occurred.
"What happened was very much in accord with what I expected," he tells me when we meet for a coffee outside the
Blackwell bookshop in the centre of the university. "The data was pretty clear about that." And the scale of the crash?
"That wasn't a surprise," he adds, in a matter-of-fact manner. "The bigger the bubble, the bigger the burst.
"The thing most economists did not fully grasp was the extent to which the banks engaged in murky risk-taking activities.
They were taking a risk with our money, their shareholders' money, the bond-holders' money," he says. Banks were
demanding up to 40 per cent of the corporate profits, saying their innovative financing was adding value. But "all this talk
about innovation was a sham" because it did not relate to any real increase in the economy's productivity, he says.
"There was a prima fade case of something screwy going on [with all the] perverse incentives that would lead them to
take excessive risk. But there was no way anyone could know or believe that the banks were [conducting themselves] at
that level of stupidity. I predicted that there was going to be a collapse because of the information asymmetry problems
that were being created." His Nobel prize was given for exactly that — showing how markets fail because different people
in them hold different levels of information.
Yet there is no hint of I-told-you-so about Stiglitz's tone as he asks the waiter for coffee. He orders decaffeinated, but
suggests the British economy needs the opposite: a stiff stimulant rather than the "fiscal consolidation" which is George
Osborne's economic euphemism for cuts.
Fiscal stimulus is out of fashion now. World leaders embarked on that strategy — injecting money to re-energise the
economy — after the banking crash three years ago. It was widely perceived not to have worked because the money
governments pumped into the banks was not passed on to ailing businesses or individuals in trouble with their mortgages.
"The problem was that, in the US, the stimulus wasn't big enough," he says. "Too much of it was in tax cuts. And when
they gave money to the banks they gave it to the wrong banks and, as a result, credit has not been restored — we can
expect a couple of million or more homes to be repossessed this year than last year — and the economy has not been
restarted." Instead of producing a consensus that the government should have done more, it has created disillusion that
the government can do anything, Stiglitz says.
The result is that, following the attacks by the financial markets on Greece and then Spain, everybody is now in a mood of
retrenchment. "It's not just pre-Keynesian, it's Hooverite," he says. By which he means governments are not just refusing
to stimulate, they are making cuts, as Herbert Hoover did in the US in 1929 — when he turned the Wall Street Crash into
the Great Depression. "Hoover had this idea that, whenever you go into recession, deficits grow, so he decided to go for
cuts — which is what the foolish financial markets that got us into this trouble in the first place now want."

It has become the new received wisdom throughout Europe. But it is the classic error made by those who confuse a
household's economics with those of a national economy.
"If you have a household that can't pay its debts, you tell it to cut back on spending to free up the cash to pay the debts.
But in a national economy, if you cut back on your spending, then economic activity goes down, nobody invests, the
amount of tax you take goes down, the amount you pay out in unemployment benefits goes up — and you don't have
enough money to pay your debts.
"The old story is still true: you cut expenditures and the economy goes down. We have lots of experiments which show
this, thanks to Herbert Hoover and the IMF," he adds. The IMF imposed that mistaken policy in Korea, Thailand,
Indonesia, Argentina and hosts of other developing countries in the 1980s and 1990s. "So we know what will happen:
economies will get weaker, investment will get stymied and it's a downward vicious spiral. How far down we don't know —
it could be a Japanese malaise. Japan did an experiment just like this in 1997; just as it was recovering, it raised VAT and
went into another recession."
Then why have we not learned from all that? Because politicians like George Osborne are driven by ideology; the national
deficit is an excuse to shrink the state because that is what he wanted anyway. Because the financial market only cares
about one thing — getting repaid. And because other European governments are panicking because of the market's wild
attack on Greece and Spain, and they don't want to be next.
"But cutbacks in Germany, Britain and France will mean all of Europe will suffer. The cuts will all feed back negatively.
And if everyone follows this policy, their budget deficits will get worse, so they will have to make more cuts and raise taxes
more. It's a vicious downward spiral. We're now looking at a long, hard, slow recovery with the possibility of a double dip if
everybody cuts back at the same time. The best scenario is long and hard ... and the worst is much worse. If any one of
these countries is forced into default, the banking system is so highly leveraged that it could cause real problems. This is
really risky, really scary."
So what should we be doing? "The lesson is not that you cut back spending, but that you redirect it. You cut out the war in
Afghanistan. You cut a couple of hundred billion dollars of wasteful military expenditure. You cut out oil subsidies. There's
a long list of things we can cut. But you increase spending in other areas, such as research and development,
infrastructure, education" — areas where government can get a good return on the investment of public money. "I haven't
done the calculation for Britain, but, for the US, all you need is a return on government investment of 5 to 6 per cent and
the long-term deficit debt is lowered."
Taxes also need to be restructured. Osborne has increased capital gains tax for high earners from 18 to 28 per cent.
"There's absolutely no reason why you couldn't tax speculative gains [from rising house or land prices] by 40 per cent.
There's no social return on it and land is going to be there whether people have speculated or not. But you lower the tax
on investment in things like R&D."

no real opposition, which is just as well, let Cameron/Clegg dig their own hole. Labour needs a new face after Gordon.
Lots of internal tensions inside LDs, will only get worse. They are seen as the enablers. This can't be sustained. This
budget isn't the end either. College tuition probably to double this fall, among other new measures.

"The old story is still true: you cut expenditures and the economy goes down. We
have lots of experiments which show this, thanks to Herbert Hoover and the IMF,"
he adds. The IMF imposed that mistaken policy in Korea, Thailand, Indonesia,
Argentina and hosts of other developing countries in the 1980s and 1990s. "So we
know what will happen: economies will get weaker, investment will get stymied
and it's a downward vicious spiral. How far down we don't know - it could be a
Japanese malaise. Japan did an experiment just like this in 1997; just as it was
recovering, it raised VAT and went into another recession."
Then why have we not learned from all that? Because politicians like George
Osborne are driven by ideology; the national deficit is an excuse to shrink the
state because that is what he wanted anyway. Because the financial market only

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770101 Date: 08/31/2015
cares about one thing - getting repaid. And because other European governments
are panicking because of the market's wild attack on Greece and Spain, and they
don't want to be next.
"But cutbacks in Germany, Britain and France will mean all of Europe will
suffer. The cuts will all feed back negatively. And if everyone follows this
policy, their budget deficits will get worse, so they will have to make more
cuts and raise taxes more. It's a vicious downward spiral. We're now looking at
a long, hard, slow recovery with the possibility of a double dip if everybody
cuts back at the same time. The best scenario is long and hard ... and the worst
is much worse. If any one of these countries is forced into default, the banking
system is so highly leveraged that it could cause real problems. This is really
risky, really scary."
So what should we be doing? "The lesson is not that you cut back spending, but
that you redirect it. You cut out the war in Afghanistan. You cut a couple of
hundred billion dollars of wasteful military expenditure. You cut out oil
. subsidies. There's a long list of things we can cut. But you increase spending
in other areas, such as research and development, infrastructure, education" -
areas where government can get a good return on the investment of public money.
"I haven't done the calculation for Britain, but, for the US, all you need is a
return on government investment of 5 to 6 per cent and the long-term deficit
debt is lowered."
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770101 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770101 Date: 08/31/2015
Taxes also need to be restructured. Osborne has increased capital gains tax for
high earners from 18 to 28 per cent. "There's absolutely no reason why you
couldn't tax speculative gains [from rising house or land prices] by 40 per
cent. There's no social return on it and land is going to be there whether
people have speculated or not. But you lower the tax on investment in things
like R&D."
Stiglitz has one more practical solution to offer. Governments should set up
their own banks to restart lending to businesses and save struggling homeowners
from repossession. "If the banks aren't lending, let's create a new lending
facility to do that job," he says. "In the US, we gave $700bn to the banks; if
we had used a fraction of that to create a new bank, we could have financed all
the lending that was needed."
Indeed, it could be done for far less. "Tak $100bn, lever that at 10 to 1 [by
attracting funds from the private sector] and that's a trillion-dollar new
lending capacity - more than the real economy needs."
Such a move would help ordinary people more than all Osborne's rhetoric about
being tough but fair. Stiglitz is sceptical, too, about the moral underpinning
of a Budget which claims that "we are all in this together", but then hits the
poorest hardest.
Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies has suggested that the Chancellor's
Budget will cost the poor 2.5 per cent of their income, while the rich will lose
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770101 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770101 Date: 08/31/2015
just 1 per cent. "I've not made an independent study on that point, but cuts in
public services will have a disproportionate effect on the poor," Stiglitz says.
Osborne's Budget "may be well-intentioned, but it takes an enormous amount of
work to make sure that a package of public spending cuts of that magnitude
doesn't hit the poor disproportionately".
His big fear is that overseas aid, which has been protected in this first round
of cuts, will not escape a second. "Developing countries have redirected
themselves towards Asia, and China in particular, in recent years, so growth in
Africa will be more robust than one might have expected, given the severity of
the downturn," he says.
Even so, aid remains vital to poor countries. "If aid is cut back, growth will
be badly affected," he says. "China is providing aid, but its aid is all in
infrastructure, whereas aid from the US and Europe is mainly in education and
health - areas in which ordinary people will suffer most if there are cuts."
Joseph Stiglitz has come full circle. What the world needs now - developing and
developed - is not retrenchment but greater economic stimulus. It is not a
message many are in the mood to hear. But they didn't listen to him last time,
either. And he turned out to be right, and they were wrong - and at what a cost
to us all.

Projection from exit of 305 tory seats, 326 majority, LibDems underperforming at 61 in exit. Informed people don't
believe exit, going to be counted out district by district into tomorrow. Tories and Murdoch will try to drive Gordon out
though they lack majority, will say he's repudiated, must concede. Gordon may reach out to Clegg, don't know. Shaun
talked to Alastait Campbell about it yesterday, Alistair working with Gordon. Will likely be protracted and increasingly

First and most important: Do NOT, repeat, NOT, call any prospective winner on either Election Night, May 6, or on the
next day, Friday, May 7. The result will be unclear. It will not be clear, even perhaps by Friday afternoon. Today, the
combined polls show Cameron and the Conservatives ahead but not winning an outright majority. The latest Guardian
poll, out tomorrow, shown me by Alan Rusbridger today, has the Tories falling short of a majority of seats. Even if
Cameron were to win an outright majority, Brown and Labour will attempt to make a deal with Clegg and the Liberal
Democrats. Brown remains as Prime Minister unless the Tories win outright, which take a long time to determine.

Labour and the Lib-Dems will almost certainly gain about 60 percent of the vote, more or less. Brown will reach out to
Clegg to stay in power. The deal will be that Brown will approve a referendum on proportional representation giving the
LDs much greater representationin future elections. That will spell the end forever of the Tories ever coming to power.
The Tories see the election in apocalyptic terms—and they are not wrong. Brown's weakness heralds the sort of grand
progressive coalition/alliance that Tony imagined but was never able to attempt between Labour and the LDs. Brown
offering the referendum would be the first step toward that. In the case of the Tories falling short of an outright majority
in seats, they will respond as though Brown is acting illegitimately, which he would not be by remaining as PM and
dealing with Clegg. Informed people are already talking of what might begin to unfold on Friday as "Florida." The Tories,
backed by the Murdoch press, will attempt to push Labour aside by force majeure—something that will not succeed
under those circumstances. The Murdochs are almost literally going crazy. James Murdoch and hiw wife stormed into
the offices of The Independent, not a Murdoch paper, when the paper endorsed the LDs and confronted the publisher,
screaming in the middle of the newsroom. Murdoch would be a big, big loser if Cameron loses. Another possibile
outcome is that the Conservatives come up just short and attempt their own deal with the DUP to cover the gap in seats.

Clegg just announced he wants Tories to form government as a minority government. But this may not change anything.
Tories don't have a majority and can't move. May be an opening bid.

Re: British election
First and most important: Do NOT, repeat, NOT, call any prospective winner on
either Election Night, May 6, or on the next day, Friday, May 7. The result will
be unclear. It will not be clear, even perhaps by Friday afternoon. Today, the
combined polls show Cameron and the Conservatives ahead but not winning an
outright majority. The latest Guardian poll, out tomorrow, shown me by Alan
Rusbridger today, has the Tories falling short of a majority of seats. Even if
Cameron were to win an outright majority, Brown and Labour will attempt to make
a deal with Clegg and the Liberal Democrats. Brown remains as Prime Minister
unless the Tories win outright, which take a long time to determine. Labour and
the Lib-Dems will almost certainly gain about 60 percent of the vote, more or
less. Brown will reach out to Clegg to stay in power. The deal will be that
Brown will approve a referendum on proportional representation giving the LDs
much greater representationin future elections. That will spell the end forever
of the Tories ever coming to power. The Tories see the election in apocalyptic
terms—and they are not wrong. Brown's weakness heralds the sort of grand
progressive coalition/alliance that Tony imagined but was never able to attempt
between Labour and the LDs. Brown offering the referendum would be the first
step toward that. In the case of the Tories falling short of an outright
majority in seats, they will respond as though Brown is acting illegitimately,
which he would not be by remaining as PM and dealing with Clegg. Informed people
are already talking of what might begin to unfold on Friday as "Florida." The
Tories, backed by the Murdoch press, will attempt to push Labour aside by force
majeure—something that will not succeed under those circumstances. The Murdochs
are almost literally going crazy. James Murdoch and hiw wife stormed into the
offices of The Independent, not a Murdoch paper, when the paper endorsed the LDs

and confronted the publisher, screaming in the middle of the newsroom. Murdoch
would be a big, big loser if Cameron loses. Another possibile outcome is that
the Conservatives come up just short and attempt their own deal with the DUP to
cover the gap in seats. Shaun is on to this potential, has been talking to Peter
Robinson.
No matter what, keep your powder dry until the result is crystal clear. Wait.

It seems to me that Clegg feels he's weak, can't form a grand progressive coalition--the Lib Dems have LOST seats--
Clegg's so-called "modernizing" has failed. So Clegg is saying no deal with Labour, Tories must govern without acting on
their program. He's plalying for another election relatively soon, perhaps a year, hoping to do better, but will do even
worse having played the spoiler. And if Labour goes out, so does Gordon and Labour will have a new face, probably

Maariv: Netanyahu won't meet Clinton; 'sources' say she
"isn't relevant"
Didi Remez I July 1,2010 at 15:25 I Categories: Diplomacy I URL: http://wp.me/pH1QV-Ep
Do they honestly think that publicizing a quote like this, on record or off, works to their advantage?
Israeli diplomatic [euphemism for Prime Minister's Office -- DR] sources said: "Clinton isn't relevant and
is out of the circle of influence. Mitchell has taken over the peace process to a great extent and Obama, in
any event, is the important person in this story because he is the one who decides."
etanyahu to meet Obama, but not Clinton
Eli Bardenstein, Maariv, July 1 2010 [page 7; Hebrew original here and at bottom of post]
rime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is to leave next week for Washington, where he will meet
with US President Barack Obama. Rather curiously, he is not scheduled to meet with Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton in the course of his visit to Washington.
Contrary to his previous visit in March, this time the US administration intends to create the impression,
outwardly at least, that the severe crisis in the relationship has passed and that the relations between the
two countries are as strong as ever. In order to bolster that impression, the two leaders will meet the media
together and will be photographed. As opposed to the previous time, Netanyahu will also be put up at Blair
House, the official White House guesthouse, and not at a hotel.
That said, officials in Washington are waiting apprehensively for the answers that Netanyahu will provide in
the course of the meeting, which is expected to address the transition from the proximity talks that are at an
impasse to direct negotiations. Obama, apparently, will demand that Netanyahu agree to extend the
construction freeze in Judea and Samaria beyond the September 26 expiration date in hope of securing PA

Re: Latest on UK (5:15 pm, Friday, London); plus Euro and Tony
Everyone has their favorite scenario, but it seems fairly obvious that it will be almost impossible for Gordon to
hang on. This process may take some days. Jonathan, who knows Clegg, says he's basically not who his voters
think he is but a pro-Europeanist Tory. When Clegg was contemplating a political career he consulted Jonathan.
Clegg comes from a Tory family. Jonathan told him to become a Tory, join a real political party rather than the
Lib Dems, but Clegg thought he would advance further with LDs. So several theories: 1. Clegg makes an
outright deal with Cameron, including for some form of proportional representation (giving LDs more seats in
future elections) and cabinet positions. Clegg might become foreign secretary under this scenario. This is the
scenario Jonathan believes may well happen. 2. Clegg supports Cameron to form a minority government, but
doesn't go into a coalition. Instead his deal involves Cameron dropping almost the whole Tory program but a
joint program on financial recovery to be proposed in the Queen's Speech (equivalent of State of the Union). I
find this far-fetched. But who knows? 3. Clegg supports Cameron to form government, makes no deals.
Jonathan Freedland, who spent last week with Clegg, told me today that Clegg told him a deal with Gordon
would appear dirty. Yet making a deal with Cameron would also make Clegg to be a dealmaker, even without a
deal on program. These are the convolutions people are going through waiting for resolution. Then, Gordon:
Gordon is trying to figure out how to form a coalition. Clegg is refusing him. Gordon may propose Clegg's
maximum demands to him to see if he will publicly refuse them. Hard to know when this comes to a head and if
and when Gordon departs. Jonathan told me that Tony's view is that Gordon will go but that he couldn't see how
Gordon would understand it or exactly how he would go. Barring any clear process, skipping ahead, David
appears to be frontrunner for successor as leader of opposition. He would be well positioned to be the future PM
if he plays it right under these circumstances. More to come...

Re: The Downing Street meeting today
Today a seven hour meeting took place at Downing Street to attempt to determine Gordon's
strategy. The participants were Gordon, Shaun, Peter, Alastair Campbell, and Ed Balls (who is
close to Gordon).
1. Gordon has made a maximum proposal to Clegg through intermediaries, including a
referendum on proportional representation, program, cabinet slots if Clegg wants them, or
not if he prefers to be perceived as above dealmaking. The offer is open, too, and can be
added to. Gordon is letting Cameron and Clegg have their conversation without going
public. Clegg in private is in something of a state of shock. He actually expected to win
about 125 seats—and finished at 57, losing 14 from what the Lib-Dems held. While
Clegg is out front he cannot make a deal on his own; he requires his party's backing.
Gordon and his people are in touch with people close to Clegg. Many of Clegg's senior
people will not support the deal that Cameron has proposed. Vincent Cable, Clegg's
number two, the shadow chancellor, is unhappy with the Tory deal. Clegg is therefore at
sea. Clegg's party base, moreover, would not approve a deal that did not represent a
"progressive" position. Much of the Lib-Dem base is idealistic and subject to
disillusionment.
2. Gordon is doing whatever he can to hold on to power. Shaun, for his part, is working on
an economic package for Northern Ireland to win support from the DUP and other parties
for Labour—a package to be proposed in the Queen's Speech. Peter floats in and out of
the meeting and appears on TV. Alastair has emerged as a stalwart, providing Gordon
with talking points and practical ideas hour by hour.
3. The Tories are working overtime to foster the atmosphere that Gordon is repudiated and
should leave. This perception is gaining ground as the Cameron-Clegg talks go on.
Cameron seems to be dragging them out in order to undermine Gordon.
4. The outcome is highly uncertain largely because Clegg is between a rock and a hard
place within his own party. More to come later...

The "Summer Camp Of Destruction:" Israeli High Schoolers
Assist The Razing Of A Bedouin Town
On 07.31.10, By Max Blumenthal
AL-ARAKIB, ISRAEL — On July 26, Israeli police demolished 45 buildings in the unrecognized Bedouin village of al-
Arakib, razing the entire village to the ground to make way for a Jewish National Fund forest. The destruction was part of
a larger project to force the Bedouin community of the Negev away from their ancestral lands and into seven Indian
reservation-style communities the Israeli government has constructed for them. The land will then be open for Jewish
settlers, including young couples in the army and those who may someday be evacuated from the West Bank after a
peace treaty is signed. For now, the Israeli government intends to uproot as many villages as possible and erase them
from the map by establishing "facts on the ground" in the form of JNF forests. (See video of of al-Arakib's
demolition here).
Moments before the destruction of the Bedouin village of al-Arakib, Israeli high school age police volunteers lounge on
furniture taken from a family's home. [The following four photos are by Ata Abu Madyam of Arab Negev News.
One of the most troubling aspects of the destruction of al-Arakib was a report by CNN that the hundreds of Israeli riot
police who stormed the village were accompanied by "busloads of cheering civilians." Who were these civilians and why
didn't CNN or any outlet investigate further?
I traveled to al-Arakib yesterday with a delegation from Ta'ayush, an Israeli group that promotes a joint Arab-Jewish
struggle against the occupation. The activists spent the day preparing games and activities for the village's traumatized
children, helping the villagers replace their uprooted olive groves, and assisting in the reconstruction of their demolished
homes. In a massive makeshift tent where many of al-Arakib's residents now sleep, I interviewed village leaders about the
identity of the cheering civilians. Each one confirmed the presence of the civilians, describing how they celebrated the
demolitions. As I compiled details, the story grew increasingly horrific. After interviewing more than a half dozen 'elders of
the village, I was able to finally identify the civilians in question. What I discovered was more disturbing than I had
ima. med.
Israeli police youth volunteers pick through the belongings an al-Arakib family
Arab Negev News publisher Ata Abu Madyam supplied me with a series of photos he took of the civilians in action. They
depicted Israeli high school students who appeared to have volunteered as members of the Israeli police civilian guard (I
'am working on identifying some participants by name). Prior to the demolitions, the student volunteers were sent into the
villagers' homes to extract their furniture and belongings. A number of villagers including Madyam told me the volunteers
smashed windows and mirrors in their homes and defaced family photographs with crude drawings. Then they lounged

around on the furniture of al-Arakib residents in plain site of the owners. Finally, according to Matyam, the volunteers
celebrated while bulldozers destroyed the homes.
"What we learned from the summer camp of destruction," Madyam remarked, "is that Israeli youth are not being educated
on democracy, they are being raised on racism." (The cover of the latest issue of Madyam's Arab Negev News features a
photo of Palestinians being expelled to Jordan in 1948 juxtaposed with a photo of a family fleeing al-Arakib last week. The
headline reads, "Nakba 2010.")

According to residents of al-Arakib, the youth volunteers vandalized homes throughout the village
The Israeli civilian guard, which incorporates 70,000 citizens including youth as young as 15 (about 15% of Israeli police
volunteers are teenagers), is one of many programs designed to incorporate Israeli children into the state's military
apparatus. It is not hard to imagine what lessons the high school students who participated in the leveling of al-Arakib took
from their experience, nor is it especially difficult to predict what sort of citizens they will become once they reach'
adulthood. Not only are they being indoctrinated to swear blind allegiance to the military, they are learning to treat the
Arab outclass as less than human. The volunteers' behavior toward Bedouins, who are citizens of Israel and serve loyally
in Israeli army combat units despite widespread racism, was strikingly reminiscent of the behavior of settler youth in
Hebron who pelt Palestinian shopkeepers in the old city with eggs, rocks and human waste. If there is a distinction
between the two cases, it is that the Hebron settlers act as vigilantes while the teenagers of Israeli civilian guard vandalize
Arab property as agents of the state.
The spectacle of Israeli youth helping destroy al-Arakib helps explain why 56% of Jewish Israeli high school students do
not believe Arabs should be allowed to serve in the Knesset — why the next generation wants apartheid. Indeed, the
widespread indoctrination of Israeli youth by the military apparatus is a central factor in Israel's authoritarian trend. It
would be difficult for any adolescent boy to escape from an experience like al-Arakib, where adults in heroic warror garb
encoura e him to articipate in and gloat over acts of massive destruction, with even a trace of democratic values.
Youth volunteers extract belongings from village homes as bulldozers move in
As for the present condition of Israeli democracy, it is essential to consider the way in which the state pits its own citizens
against one another, enlisting the Jewish majority as conquerers while targeting the Arab others as, in the wordsI of Zionist
founding father Chaim Weizmann, "obstacles that had to be cleared on a difficult path." Historically, only failing states
have encouraged such corrosive dynamics to take hold. That is why the scenes from al-Arakib, from the demolished
homes to the uprooted gardens to the grinning teens who joined the mayhem, can be viewed as much more than the
destruction of a village. They are snapshots of the phenomenon that is laying Israeli society as a whole to waste

Just how broken is the Senate?
Seventy-six nominees for judgeships and executive posts have been approved by committees but, because of blocks,
haven't come up for a vote in the full Senate, leaving courtrooms idle and jobs unfilled across the upper levels of the

The tally of cloture votes reflects only a small fraction of senatorial obstruction. Three hundred and forty-five bills passed
by the House have been prevented from even coming up for debate in the Senate....

Cit and watch us for seven days," one senator says of the deadlocked chamber. "You know what you'll see happening?
Nothing."

'This is just one of those days when you want to throw up your hands and say, 'What in the world are we doing?'"
Senator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat, said.
"It's unconscionable," Carl Levin, the senior Democratic senator from Michigan, said. "The obstructionism has become
mindless."
The Senators were in the Capitol, sunk into armchairs before the marble fireplace in the press lounge, which is directly
behind the Senate chamber. It was four-thirty on a Wednesday afternoon. McCaskill, in a matching maroon jacket and
top, looked exasperated; Levin glowered over his spectacles.
"Also, it's a dumb rule in itself," McCaskill said. "It's time we started looking at some of these rules."
She was referring to Senate Rule XXVI, Paragraph 5, which requires unanimous consent for committees and
subcommittees to hold hearings after two in the afternoon while the Senate is in session. Both Levin and McCaskill had
scheduled hearings that day for two-thirty. Typically, it wouldn't be difficult to get colleagues to waive the rule; a general
and an admiral had flown halfway around the world to appear before Levin's Armed Services Committee, and McCaskill's
Subcommittee on Contracting Oversight of the Homeland Security Committee was investigating the training of Afghan
police. But this was March 24th, the day after President Barack Obama signed the health-care-reform bill, in a victory
ceremony at the White House; it was also the day that the Senate was to vote on a reconciliation bill for health-care
reform, approved by the House three nights earlier, which would retroactively remove the new law's most embarrassing
sweetheart deals and complete the yearlong process of passing universal health care. Republicans, who had fought the
bill as a bloc, were in no mood to make things easy.
So, four hours earlier, when Levin went to the Senate floor and asked for consent to hold his hearing, Senator Richard
Burr, Republican of North Carolina, and a member of Levin's committee, had refused. "I have no personal objection to
continuing," Burr said. But, he added, "there is objection on our side of the aisle. Therefore, I would have to object."
Burr had to object on behalf of his party because he was the only Republican in the chamber when Levin spoke. In
general, when senators give speeches on the floor, their colleagues aren't around, and the two or three who might be
present aren't listening. They're joking with aides, or e-mailing Twitter ideas to their press secretaries, or getting their first
look at a speech they're about to give before the eight unmanned cameras that provide a live feed to C-SPAN2. The
presiding officer of the Senate—freshmen of the majority party take rotating, hour-long shifts intended to introduce them to
the ways of the institution—sits in his chair on the dais, scanning his BlackBerry or reading a Times article about the
Senate. Michael Bennet, a freshman Democrat from Colorado, said, "Sit and watch us for seven days—just watch the
floor. You know what you'll see happening? Nothing. When I'm in the chair, I sit there thinking, I wonder what they're
doing in China right now?"
Between speeches, there are quorum calls, time killers in which a Senate clerk calls the roll at the rate of one name every
few minutes. The press gallery, above the dais, is typically deserted, as journalists prefer to hunker down in the press
lounge, surfing the Web for analysis of current Senate negotiations; television screens alert them if something of interest
actually happens in the chamber. The only people who pay attention to a speech are the Senate stenographers. On this
afternoon, two portly bald men in suits stood facing the speaker from a few feet away, tapping at the transcription
machines, which resembled nineteenth-century cash registers, slung around their necks. The Senate chamber is an
intimate room where men and women go to talk to themselves for the record.
Like many other aspects of senatorial procedure, Rule XXVI, Paragraph 5 is a relic from the days when senators had to
hover around their desks to know what was happening on the floor during the main afternoon debate. (The desks, some
built as long ago as 1819, are mahogany, and their lids lift up, like those in an old schoolhouse; the desks of the Majority
and Minority Leader are still equipped with brass spittoons.) In the press lounge, McCaskill said, with light sarcasm,
"Somebody told me the rule is to make sure people pay attention to what's happening on the floor during debate and not
be distracted by committee work. Clearly, it's an old rule."
The Republicans had turned this old rule into a new means of obstruction. There would be no hearings that afternoon; the
general and the admiral would have to come back another day. Like investment bankers on Wall Street, senators these
days direct much of their creative energy toward the manipulation of arcane rules and loopholes, scoring short-term
successes while magnifying their institution's broader dysfunction.
Around five o'clock, the chamber began to fill, as the reconciliation bill came up for a vote; there were twenty-three
amendments pending, all from Republicans, and perhaps many more to come. Ordinarily, debate and voting on an
amendment might take two legislative days, but under the rules of the reconciliation bill the senators were to dispatch the
amendments one after another, as in a hot-dog-eating contest, with a minute of debate for each side. The goal was to
finish the bill by the end of the evening, so that senators wouldn't miss a day of their spring recess—apparently, the only
thing worse than a government takeover of the health-care system. The usual longueurs of the Senate, where forty
minutes can tick away on the antique clock above the rear double doors without a word's being spoken, were about to
yield to a frenzy. Harry Reid, the Majority Leader, from Nevada, had predicted that the process, known as Vote-O-Rama,
would go past two in the morning, and had warned senators to stay close to the chamber.
Max Baucus, of Montana, the manager of the bill for the Democrats, rose and said, "This is the first time in recent memory
that a reconciliation bill has all the amendments on one side only. These are clearly amendments designed to kill the
reconciliation and, therefore, kill health-care reform. So I very much hope that all of these amendments are defeated."
Tall, gaunt Judd Gregg, of New Hampshire, the bill's Republican manager, took the floor. "The position on the other side
of the aisle is: no amendments allowed, even if they are good," he said. Indignation rouged his cheeks, and his voice rose
half an octave. "Obviously, they presume the Republican Party is an inconvenience. The democratic process is an

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770192 Date: 08/31/2015
inconvenience. It also appears, considering the opposition to this out in America, that the American people are an
inconvenience."
The Senate chamber is laid out in four concentric semicircles, with adjacent desks almost touching on the crowded
Democratic side, and the desks of the much smaller Republican minority spaced loosely apart. The design is meant to
emphasize the senators' unity. But Baucus and Gregg avoided eye contact across the six feet of aisle that now divides the
chamber into two constantly warring factions. Senators are required, by custom, to speak of one another in the third
person, directing their anger and sarcasm through whichever poor freshman happens to be the presiding officer at the
moment. Rule XIX, Paragraphs 2 and 3—one of the original rules drawn from Thomas Jefferson's "Manual of
Parliamentary Practice"—bars senators from imputing unworthy conduct or motives to another senator, and from insulting
any senator's state. But there is no rule against finger-wagging, and Baucus wagged his at Gregg while shouting at Al
Franken, of Minnesota, who had started a shift in the presiding officer's chair: "Mr. President, make no mistake, the intent
of every single one of the amendments offered on the other side of the aisle is to kill health-care reform. . . . A senator on
the other side of the aisle stood up and said that this is hopefully the President's Waterloo. They want to kill health-care
reform!"
The voice of Stuart Smalley filled the chamber: "The time of the senator has expired."
For the next nine hours, the chamber became the stage of a theatrical whose ending, like almost everything that happens
on the Senate floor, was known in advance to all. The Republican goal in Vote-O-Rama was to embarrass the Democrats
while appearing to suggest useful changes; the Democratic goal was to prevent any change to the bill, so that it wouldn't
have to return to the House, where it might be voted down. Several of the Republican amendments had been designed to
make Democrats look hypocritical, by forcing them to vote against policies that the Party typically supports. One
amendment, for example, declared that the health-care bill could not be linked to a tax hike on individuals making less
than two hundred thousand dollars a year. Other amendments were more nakedly partisan, and outlandish. David Vitter, a
Louisiana Republican, proposed an amendment that repealed the entire law. Senator Tom Coburn, a Republican
obstetrician from Oklahoma, introduced an amendment to insure that veterans diagnosed with mental illness would not be
denied the right to own firearms, and another to prevent "convicted child molesters, rapists, and sex offenders" from
buying erectile-dysfunction drugs with taxpayer funds. Coburn got through the minute he was allotted to explain his Viagra
amendment without cracking a smile. "This is not a game amendment," he insisted. "It actually saves money."
So many senators snickered that the presiding officer banged his gavel for order.
"The amendment offered by the senator from Oklahoma makes a mockery of this Senate," Baucus declared. "It is a crass
political stunt aimed at making thirty-second commercials, not public policy." Baucus asked for the yeas and nays, and a
clerk called the roll at a ragged pace. "Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins." Thirty-five-second pause. "Mr. Conrad, Mr.
Corker." Ten seconds. "Mr. Cornyn." Senators pay no attention to the sound of their name; they cast votes when they're
so inclined—wandering in late, shuffling down the chamber's gentle blue-carpeted steps to the swarm of colleagues
milling about in the well, where the clerks sit at a table, and then holding a finger up or down. At one point, John McCain—
now just one of a hundred senators and struggling to stay in office—spent half a minute waving stiff-armed, trying to catch
the eye of a clerk so he could cast his vote. In the end, two Democrats—Evan Bayh, of Indiana, and Ben Nelson, of
Nebraska—joined the Republicans in opposing Viagra for sex offenders. The amendment was defeated.
The carpeting in the chamber absorbs voices, and during the long night one of the few that rose above the muffled drone
was that of Charles Schumer, who said to Gregg, "Get to work! Stop screwing around with health care!" Sporadically, a
sharp cackle emanated from Al Franken, who wandered the chamber, looking for Republicans he could charm into
laughing. Observed from the press gallery, the senators in their confined space began to resemble zoo animals—Levin a
shambling brown bear, John Thune a loping gazelle, Jim Bunning a maddened grizzly. Each one displayed a limited set of
behaviors: in conversations, John Kerry planted himself a few inches away, loomed, and clamped his hands down on a
colleague's shoulders. Joe Lieberman patted everyone on the back. It became clear which senators were loners (Russ
Feingold, Daniel Akaka) and which were social (Blanche Lincoln, Lindsey Graham); which senators were important (Dick
Durbin, Jon Kyl) and which were ignored (Bayh, Bunning).
Past midnight, Durbin slumped at his desk, one hand over his face, yawning painfully. Susan Collins was going through
her mail. Twenty-three amendments had been voted down, and the Republicans were proposing a fresh batch. "Can we
get some order?" Bunning growled, before he introduced a proposal to let senior citizens opt out of parts of Medicare. It
was the only amendment that any Republicans joined the Democrats to defeat.
Harry Reid controls the Senate's schedule, but Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, who is the Minority Leader, can object.
Since nearly everything in the Senate depends on unanimous consent, the main business of the place is a continuous
negotiation between these two supremely unsentimental men. That night, they played a game of chicken: McConnell,
unsmiling, his eyes riveted ahead, held out the prospect of dozens more amendments; Reid, a former boxer, was
hunched and mumbling, playing rope-a-dope, vowing to fend off amendments all night. The two leaders left the chamber
to confer privately about how to proceed. Inside, the atmosphere of a slumber party set in. Debbie Stabenow, of Michigan,
her hand across her heart, sang a sentimental duet with Robert Menendez, of New Jersey. Exhaustion momentarily
eased the partisan divide. Claire McCaskill sat down beside Tom Coburn, held up an erect finger in his face, as if casting
her Viagra vote, then let it go limp. Coburn could be heard to joke, "The longest it lasted was thirty seconds."
At two-forty-five in the morning, Reid suddenly declared the Senate adjourned. The Senate parliamentarian had just found
two small violations of the reconciliation rules, meaning that in the morning, despite the Democrats' efforts, the bill would
go back to the House for another vote. At the bang of the gavel, the senators fled. In the parking lot, on the Capitol's

northeast side, McCaskill climbed into her S.U.V. Levin, in a cramped sedan, was chauffeured off into the empty streets.
On a marble ledge near the exit, Arlen Specter sat alone, a ghost in a brown suit, staring straight ahead, as if waiting for
someone to take him away.
The Senate reconvened at 9:45 A.M. Around two in the afternoon, the members gathered for the final vote, and the
Democrats were giddy. Tom Harkin, of Iowa, and Christopher Dodd, of Connecticut, even exchanged a hug. "Everyone's
tired," Reid declared before the final vote. "This legislative fight is one for the record books." He was so fatigued that he
initially voted the wrong way. Lindsey Graham came in late, delaying the tally by ten minutes. "Way to go, Lindsey, way to
stretch it out," Sam Brownback told him. A few Republicans lingered and took in the moment, like players on the losing
team at the end of the World Series. After a year of work, health-care reform had passed, 56-43, and for a moment the
chamber's Tweeting pygmies had become legislative giants.
The Senate is often referred to as "the world's greatest deliberative body." Jeff Merkley, a freshman Democrat from
Oregon, said, "That is a phrase that I wince each time I hear it, because the amount of real deliberation, in terms of
exchange of ideas, is so limited." Merkley could remember witnessing only one moment of floor debate between a
Republican and a Democrat. "The memory I took with me was: 'Wow, that's unusual—there's a conversation occurring in
which they're making point and counterpoint and challenging each other.' And yet nobody else was in the chamber."
Tom Udall, a freshman Democrat from New Mexico, could not recall seeing a senator change another senator's mind.
"You would really need a good hour or two of extensive exchange among folks that really know the issue," he said.
Instead, a senator typically gives "a prepared speech that's already been vetted through the staff. Then another guy gets
up and gives a speech on a completely different subject." From time to time, senators of the same party carry on a
colloquy—"I would be interested in the distinguished senator from Iowa's view of the other side's Medicare Advantage
plan"—that has been scripted in advance by aides.
While senators are in Washington, their days are scheduled in fifteen-minute intervals: staff meetings, interviews, visits
from lobbyists and home-state groups, caucus lunches, committee hearings, briefing books, floor votes, fund-raisers.
Each senator sits on three or four committees and even more subcommittees, most of which meet during the same
morning hours, which helps explain why committee tables are often nearly empty, and why senators drifting into a hearing
can barely sustain a coherent line of questioning. All this activity is crammed into a three-day week, for it's an unwritten
rule of the modern Senate that votes are almost never scheduled for Mondays or Fridays, which allows senators to spend
four days away from the capital. Senators now, unlike those of several decades ago, often keep their families in their
home states, where they return most weekends, even if it's to Alaska or Idaho—a concession to endless fund-raising, and
to the populist anti-Washington mood of recent years. (When Newt Gingrich became Speaker of the House, in 1995, he
told new Republican members not to move their families to the capital.) Tom Daschle, the former Democratic leader, said,
"When we scheduled votes, the only day where we could be absolutely certain we had all one hundred senators there
was Wednesday afternoon."
Nothing dominates the life of a senator more than raising money. Tom Harkin, the Iowa Democrat, said, "Of any free time
you have, I would say fifty per cent, maybe even more," is spent on fund-raising. In addition to financing their own
campaigns, senators participate at least once a week in the Power Hour, during which they make obligatory calls on
behalf of the Party (in the Democrats' case, from a three-story town house across Constitution Avenue from the Senate
office buildings, since they're barred from using their own offices to raise money). Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee
Republican, insisted that the donations are never sufficient to actually buy a vote, but he added, "It sucks up time that a
senator ought to be spending getting to know other senators, working on issues."
In June, 2009, top aides to Max Baucus, whose Finance Committee was negotiating the health-care-reform bill, took time
to meet with two health-care lobbyists, who themselves were former Baucus aides. (Baucus received more than a million
dollars from the industry for his 2008 reelection campaign.) That month, according to Common Cause, industry groups
were spending $1.4 million a day to lobby members of Congress. Udall, speaking of the corrosive effect of fund-raising
and lobbying, said, "People know it in their heart—they know this place is dominated by special interests. The over-all bills
are not nearly as bold because of the influence of money."
Deschle sketched a portrait of the contemporary senator who is too busy to think: "Sometimes, you're dialling for dollars,
you get the call, you've got to get over to vote, you've got fifteen minutes. You don't have a clue what's on the floor, your
staff is whispering in your ears, you're running onto the floor, then you check with your leader—you double check—but,
just to make triple sure, there's a little sheet of paper on the clerk's table: The leader recommends an aye vote, or a no
vote. So you've got all these checks just to make sure you don't screw up, but even then you screw up sometimes. But, if
you're ever pressed, 'Why did you vote that way?'—you just walk out thinking, Oh, my God, I hope nobody asks, because
I don't have a clue."
Aides, at the elbows of senators as they shuttle between their offices and the Capitol, have proliferated over the past few
decades, and they play a crucial role. Lamar Alexander, who has an office of fifty people, pointed out that staff members,
who are younger and often more ideological than their bosses, and less dependent on institutional relationships, tend to
push senators toward extremes. Often, aides are the main actors behind proposed legislation—writing bills, negotiating
the details—while the senator is relegated to repeating talking points on Fox' or MSNBC.
One day in his office, Udall picked up some tabloids from his coffee table and waved them at me. "You know about all
these rags that cover the Hill, right?" he said, smiling. There are five dailies—Politico, The Hill, Roll Call, Con gressDaily,
and CQ Today—all of which emphasize insider conflict. The senators, who like to complain about the trivializing effect of
the "24/7 media," provide no end of fodder for it. The news of the day was what Udall called a "dust-up" between Scott

Brown, the freshman Massachusetts Republican, and a staffer for Jim DeMint, the arch-conservative from South Carolina;
the staffer had Tweeted that Brown was voting too often with the Democrats, leading Brown to confront DeMint on the
Senate floor over this supposed breach of protocol. Bloggers carry so much influence that many senators have a young
press aide dedicated to the care and feeding of online media. News about, by, and for a tiny kingdom of political
obsessives dominates the attention of senators and staff, while stories that might affect their constituents go unreported
because their home-state papers can no longer afford to have bureaus in Washington. Dodd, who came to the Senate in
1981 and will leave next January, told me, "I used to have eleven Connecticut newspaper reporters who covered me on a
daily basis. I don't have one today, and haven't had one in a number of years. Instead, D.C. publications only see me
through the prism of conflict." Lamar Alexander described the effect as "this instant radicalizing of positions to the left and
the right."
Both Alexander and Gregg said that the Senate had been further polarized by the rising number of senators—now nearly
fifty—who come from the House, rather than from governorships or other positions where bipartisan coOperation is still
permissible. "A lot of senators don't understand the history or tradition of the institution," Gregg said. "Substantive,
thoughtful, moderate discussion is pushed aside."
Encumbered with aides, prodded by hourly jolts from electronic media, racing from the hearing room to the caucus lunch
to the Power Hour to the airport, senators no longer have the time, or perhaps the inclination, to get to know one
another—least of all, members of the other party. Friendships across party lines are more likely among the few spouses
who live in Washington. After Udall joined the Senate, last year, he was invited to dinner by Alexander, because Jill
Cooper Udall and Honey Alexander had become friends through a women's social club. It remains the only time Udall has
set foot in the house of a Republican senator. (Vice-President Joe Biden, in his autobiography, recalls that, in the
seventies, a bipartisan group of senators and their wives hosted a monthly dinner: "In those days Democrats and
Republicans actually enjoyed each other's company.") When I asked Chris Dodd how well he knew, for example, Jim
DeMint, Dodd said, "Not at all. Whereas Jesse Helms and I knew each other pretty well." He repeated something that Jon
Kyl, the Republican whip, from Arizona, had recently said to him: "There's no trust." Dodd, whose father was a senator,
went on, "That's really all there is—this place really operates on that. I don't think anyone would argue with that
conclusion. And if that's missing.
There remains a veneer—badly chipped—of comity. On the floor, senators still refer to members of the opposing party as
"friends." Gregg described Kent Conrad, a Democrat from North Dakota, as "one of my best friends in the Senate," and
both Gregg and Alexander ticked off examples of little-known legislation that they are currently working on with
Democrats; Alexander and Ben Cardin, of Maryland, have introduced a bill to ban mountaintop-removal coal mining. Udall
noted that he had become friendly with John McCain when they went on a congressional tour of Iraq. But opportunities to
bond are rare. On the first floor of the Capitol, there is a private dining room for senators, the "inner sanctum," where
Republicans and Democrats used to have lunch (at separate tables, but in the same room). In the seventies, old bulls
such as James Eastland, Hubert Humphrey, and Jacob Javits held court there; later, Daniel Patrick Moynihan did. "You
learned, and also you found out what was going on," Dodd said, adding, "It's awfully difficult to say crappy things about
someone that you just had lunch with." These days, the inner sanctum is nearly always empty. Senators eat lunch in their
respective caucus rooms with members of their party, or else "downtown," which means asking donors for money over
steak and potatoes at the Monocle or Charlie Palmer. The tradition of the "caucus lunch" was instituted by Republicans in
the fifties, when they lost their majority; Democrats, after losing theirs in 1980, followed suit. Caucus lunches work
members on both sides into a state of pep-rally fervor. During one recent Republican lunch, Jim Bunning referred to Harry
Reid as an idiot. "At least he had the courtesy to do it behind closed doors," Alexander joked, adding, "We spend most of
our time in team meetings deciding what we're going to do to each other."
In 2007, Alexander and Lieberman started a series of bipartisan Tuesday breakfasts. "They kind of dwindled off during the
health-care debate," Alexander said. Udall has tried to revive the Wednesday inner-sanctum lunch. For the first few
months, only Democrats attended. Then, one Wednesday in May, Susan Collins, the Maine Republican, showed up,
joking nervously about being a turncoat; to protect her reputation, her presence was kept secret.
These efforts at resurrecting dead customs are as self-conscious and, probably, as doomed as the get-togethers of lovers
who try to stay friends after a breakup. Ira Shapiro, a Washington lawyer and a former aide to Senator Gaylord Nelson, of
Wisconsin, put it this way: "Why would they want to have lunch together when they hate each other?"
The upper chamber of Congress was a constitutional compromise between popular sovereignty and state sovereignty.
The Senate was designed, as part of the separation of powers, to check the impulses of the House and the popular will.
For some Federalists, it also had an aristocratic purpose: to collect knowledge and experience, and to guard against a
levelling spirit that might overtake the majority. When Alexis de Tocqueville visited the Senate, in 1832, he was deeply
impressed by the quality of its members: "They represent only the lofty thoughts [of the nation] and the generous instincts
animating it, not the petty passions." But he also recognized that "a minority of the nation dominating the Senate could
completely paralyze the will of the majority represented in the other house, and that is contrary to the spirit of
constitutional government." As long as the Senate continued to be composed of America's most talented statesmen,
Tocqueville implied, it would restrain its own anti-democratic potential.
Robert A. Caro, in "Master of the Senate," the third volume of his life of Lyndon Johnson, argues that after the Civil War •
the Senate was captured by wealthy and sectional interests, ending a more high-minded age when Daniel Webster, Henry
Clay, and John C. Calhoun engaged in brilliant debate. Aside from spasms of legislation at the start of the Presidencies of
Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt, Caro writes, the Senate remained controlled by an alliance of Southern racists

and Republican corporate shills, and was "the dam against which the waves of social reform dashed themselves in vain—
the chief obstructive force in the federal government." By the fifties, the Senate had become far more conservative than
the public. And not just conservative: William S. White, in his 1956 book "Citadel," called the Senate "to a most peculiar
degree, a Southern Institution . . . growing at the heart of this ostensibly national assembly" and "the only place in the
country where the South did not lose the war."
By mid-century, it had become a journalistic cliché to call the Senate broken. Otto Preminger's 1962 film "Advise and
Consent," based on the novel by Allen Drury, is about the Senate of that period, and it presents Democrats and
Republicans as equally amoral, calculating, and power-hungry. But the institution, as depicted by Preminger, still works, in
its way: though the deals stink, they get cut. The senators know their colleagues and the rules; they back-stab one
another in the lunchroom, then drink cocktails and play cards on Saturday nights. There are no lobbyists, no fund-raisers,
no media, no constituents—only senators' intricate relations with one another. The Senate is its own world.
In a memoir, Johnson's longtime aide Harry McPherson recalls learning that the Senate's "famous 'club' atmosphere is
based on the members' mutual acceptance of responsibility and concentration on the tasks at hand. . . . They thrust hard
at one another in debate over serious matters," but, he writes, "understanding and accommodation in the ordinary course
of the Senate day was essential to sanity." Johnson, the most powerful Majority Leader in history, bent the Senate to his
will and forced it to become more efficient. He saw his colleagues as either "whales"—the heavyweight chairmen who
negotiated legislation—or "minnows," the followers who went along with the brokered deals. And when, in 1958, a
formidable new class of liberal Democrats entered the Senate—including Edmund Muskie, Eugene McCarthy, and Philip
Hart—the legislative machinery began to produce reform. Michael Janeway, the author of "The Fall of the House of
Roosevelt," worked as a summer staff member between 1958 and 1962. "They used to talk to each other—that's my most
vivid recollection," he said. "If Wayne Morse talked of constitutional law on the floor, the Southerners would come in to
hear him. The same with Hubert Humphrey on farm policy. My strongest impression was of it being a deliberative body,
drawing each other out—sometimes pedantically." Senators who ran for office in order to work on foreign policy, social
welfare, or urbanization had to win credibility with the whales. "But if you wanted to do something there was a mechanism
by which you could do it," Janeway said.
In the sixties and seventies, Southern-conservative control was broken by a coalition of left-of-center Democrats and
moderate Republicans. Donald Ritchie, the Senate historian, who started working there in 1976, described the Senate of
those decades as "a bipartisan liberal institution." The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was written largely out of the office of the
Republican Minority Leader, Everett Dirksen. Every major initiative—voting rights, open housing, environmental law,
campaign reform—enjoyed bipartisan support. In the rare event of a filibuster, the motion to end debate was often filed
jointly by leaders of both parties. When Medicare—that government takeover of health care for the elderly—was passed,
in 1965, it won 70-24.
The Senate's momentum nurtured superb talent: William Fulbright, Everett Dirksen, Henry Jackson, Frank Church,
Howard Baker. In 1969, George McGovern chaired a select committee on hunger that actually held bipartisan "field
hearings" in poor regions, calling witnesses in migrant labor camps, and then, with Bob Dole's indispensable support,
greatly expanded the food-stamp program. The intensity of senatorial purpose in those years must strike today's
legislators as profoundly humbling. After Joe Biden came to the Senate, in 1973, Hubert Humphrey took him aside and
said, "You have to pick an issue that becomes yours. That's how you attract your colleagues to follow you, Joe. That's
how you demonstrate your bona fides. Don't be a gadfly." Humphrey's career advice: "You should become Mr. Housing.
Housing is the future."
The Senate's modern decline began in 1978, with the election of a new wave of anti-government conservatives, and
accelerated as Republicans became the majority in 1981. "The Quayle generation came in, and there were a number of
people just like Dan—same generation, same hair style, same beliefs," Gary Hart, the Colorado Democrat, recalled. "They
were harder-line. They weren't there to get along with Democrats. But they look accommodationist compared to
Republicans in the Senate today." Church, McGovern, Javits, and Birch Bayh were gone. Ira Shapiro, the former aide,
who is writing a book about the Senate of the sixties and seventies, said, "It was a huge loss of the most experienced,
accomplished senators being replaced by neophytes. All of a sudden, in 1981, more than half the Senate had been there
less than six years." He added, "The shattering of the great Senate has long-term effects that keep showing up. It gets
worse over time, but it just never gets restored. There was a phrase I heard from Helms and the younger ones: 'Others
didn't want to make waves; I wanted to drain the swamp.'"
After C-SPAN went on the air, in 1979, the cozy atmosphere that encouraged both deliberation and back-room deals
began to yield to transparency and, with it, posturing. "So Damn Much Money," a recent book by the Washington Post
reporter Robert G. Kaiser, traces the spectacular rise of Washington lobbying to the same period. Liberal Republicans
began to disappear, and as Southern Democrats died out they were replaced by conservative Republicans. Bipartisan
coalitions on both wings of the Senate vanished. The institutionalist gave way to the free agent, who controlled his own
fund-raising apparatus and media presence, and whose electoral base was a patchwork of single-issue groups. Members
of both parties—Howard Metzenbaum, the Ohio Democrat; Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican—took to
regularly using the Senate's rules to tie up business for narrowly ideological reasons. The number of filibusters shot up in
the eighties and continued to rise in the following decades, as the parties kept alternating control of the Senate and
escalating a procedural arms race, routinely blocking the confirmation of executive and judicial appointees. Democrats
filibustered Republican nominees to the bench; then Republicans threatened to ban the filibuster in such cases—the so-
called "nuclear option." Older members were perturbed when, in 2004, the Republican Majority Leader, Bill Frist, went to

South Dakota to campaign against the Democratic Minority Leader, Tom Daschle (who went on to lose). A few years
earlier, such an action would have been unthinkable.
The weakened institution could no longer withstand pressures from outside its walls; as money and cameras rushed in,
independent minds fell more and more in line with the partisans. Rough parity between the two parties meant that every
election had the potential to make or break a majority, crushing the incentive to cooperate across the aisle. The Senate,
no longer a fount of ideas, became a backwater of the U.S. government. During the Clinton years, the main action was
between the White House and the Gingrich House of Representatives; during the Bush years, the Republican Senate
majority abdicated the oversight role that could have placed a vital check on executive power.
Norman Ornstein, a congressional expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said that the Senate has increasingly
become populated by "ideologues and charlatans." He went on, "When we do get good people who come in, they very
quickly get ground up by the dynamic and the culture of the parties. And once you get there, look at what it takes to stay
there." He spoke of Charles Grassley, the Iowa Republican, who, nearing the end of his career, spent much of last year
working closely with his friend Max Baucus on the health-care bill. Then, in August, Grassley went home and, faced with
angry Republican voters and the prospect of a primary challenge from the right, started warning about "pulling the plug on
Grandma." Ornstein added that similar pressures had led John McCain to begin "altering his behavior and abandoning
every issue, including campaign-finance reform."
One morning in April, I visited Harry McPherson, the former L.B.J. aide, at the offices of the legal and lobbying firm D. L.
A. Piper, in downtown Washington. McPherson, who is eighty, had on his desk the firm's spiral-bound directory for the
111th Congress. I asked him who, in Johnsonian terms, were the whales of the current Senate. McPherson ran his finger
down the list of senators. He did it again. "I'm trying here, looking for a remote descendant. Judas Priest, look at this." He
was stumped. "Well, I see some good people, I see some people who are going to get coalitions together over time." He
put the directory aside. "I'm just having the damnedest time."
Down the hall from McPherson's office was that of Mel Martinez, a former Republican senator from Florida; he was hired
last year, two weeks after resigning his Senate seat without completing his first term. (He has since moved on to
JPMorgan Chase.) William Cohen, the former Maine senator and Secretary of Defense, has an office downstairs. Tom
Daschle works at D. L. A. Piper; his predecessor as Democratic leader, George Mitchell, was the firm's chairman, until
President Obama appointed him to be his Middle East envoy. One feature of the diminished U.S. senator is the ease with
which he moves from legislating to lobbying. Between 1998 and 2004, half the senators who left office became lobbyists.
In 2007, Trent Lott, a Republican leader in the Senate less than a year into his fourth term, abruptly resigned and formed
a lobbying firm with former Senator John Breaux, just a few weeks before a new law took effect requiring a two-year
waiting period between serving and lobbying.
When you spend your days at the Senate, it's easy to forget about everything else. The House of Representatives seems
miles away (it's just down a corridor and across the rotunda), the White House is another country, and actual foreign
countries are unimaginable. The place remains insular, labyrinthine, and opaque—even physically. Senators commute
thirty seconds between their offices and the chamber by electric subway cars that run along a tunnel under Constitution
Avenue. Many signs are misleading or obsolete (the gilded lettering over the visitors' gallery says "Men's Gallery"), and
the Capitol is filled with secret passageways and spare rooms, called hideaways, doled out according to seniority, where
senators can read, drink, doze, and wait for the buzzer announcing an imminent vote. The most pervasive authority over
the institution is not the Constitution or the Bible but, rather, an impenetrable sixteen-hundred-page tome, by Floyd M.
Riddick, called "Senate Procedure: Precedents and Practices," which only the late Robert Byrd, of West Virginia, was
known to have read in its entirety. The procedures are so abstruse that a parliamentarian must sit below the presiding
officer and, essentially, tell him or her what to say.
After half a century, the picture given by Preminger's "Advise and Consent" is still faintly visible. "The Senate, by its
nature, is a place where consensus reigns and personal relationships are paramount," Lamar Alexander said. "And that's
not changed." Which is exactly the problem: it's a self-governing body that depends on the reasonableness of its
members to function. Sarah Binder, a congressional scholar at George Washington University, said, "To have a chamber
that rules by unanimous consent—it's nutty! Especially when you've got Jim Bunning to please."
In 2006 and 2008, sixteen Democrats entered the Senate, giving the Party its current majority of fifty-nine to forty-one
(counting two independents). They include moderates, like Jon Tester, of Montana, and Mark Warner, of Virginia; liberals,
like Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, and Sheldon Whitehouse, of Rhode Island; policy specialists, like Amy Klobuchar, of
Minnesota, and Jeff Merkley; and iconoclasts, like Claire McCaskill. Their interest in legislating has won the admiration of
senior senators. "If they can stay, I think they'll be terrific," Chris Dodd said. "My worry is they won't stay. Because it's not
productive."
The Democratic class of 2008 arrived with President Obama, expecting to usher in 6 dynamic new era. Instead, their
young Senate careers have passed in a daily slog of threatened filibusters and "secret holds"—when a senator
anonymously objects to bringing an appointment up for a vote, which requires unanimous consent. On April 20th, Claire
McCaskill took the trouble to read off the names of fifty-six Obama nominees languishing in the limbo of secret holds, and
Jon Kyl objected to every one of them. Just getting a bill to the floor for debate can require days of tactical gamesmanship
between the party leaders. There were times when Warner wondered if anyone had ever quit in the first year. Michael
Bennet said, "We find ourselves at a moment in our history when the questions are huge ones, not small ones, and where
things have been put off for a really long period of time." He mentioned the national debt, energy policy, and the financial
crisis. "Yet you have a Senate that's designed not to advance change but to slow it."

We were talking in his hideaway, a windowless room in the Capitol basement, which had a mini-fridge stocked with bottled
water, black leatherette furniture circa 1962, and a TV tuned to C-SPAN2 on mute; Senator Kyl's mouth was moving.
Bennet, the former superintendent of schools in Denver, was appointed to a vacant seat in 2009, and already has to
defend it this year. He described the Senate with the dry bluntness of an outsider who hasn't allowed himself to grow too
attached. Bennet repeated a story he had heard. about a new congressman giving his maiden speech: "And then some
more veteran guy came over and said, 'Son, you're talking like this place is on the level. It's not on the level.' As the fifteen
months or so have gone by that I've been here, the less on the level it seems."
Earlier this year, the Senate's procedural absurdities became national news twice in one month. On February 4th,
Con gressDaily reported that Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican, was secretly blocking the confirmation of seventy
Obama appointees over a dispute involving defense earmarks for his•state. (His tactics exposed, Shelby—whose office
maintains that he was responsible for fewer than fifty holds—lifted all but three.) Later that month, Bunning spent several
days and a late night on the Senate floor, filibustering to prevent benefits from being paid to millions of unemployed
Americans. When Merkley tried to reason with him, Bunning responded, "Tough shit." (Eventually, Republicans persuaded
Bunning to stop.)
These incidents elicited a brief outcry, but the extent of the Senate's routine folly remains largely hidden. For example,
Grassley and Ron Wyden, of Oregon, have been trying since 1997 to end the practice of secret holds, without success. In
2007, the Senate passed a bill banning secret holds that last longer than six days. But to get around the ban two or more
senators can pass the hold back and forth—it's called "rolling holds"—and their party leader facilitates the game by
keeping their names secret.
Many of the Senate's antique rules and precedents have been warped beyond recognition by the modern pressures of
partisanship. The hold, for example, was a courtesy extended to senators in the days of horse travel, when they needed
time to get back to Washington and read a bill or question an appointee before casting their vote. Sarah Binder, who co-
authored a book on the filibuster, calls the procedure a historical accident: in 1806, the Senate got rid of a little-used rule
that allowed the "previous question" to be called to a vote. Suddenly, there was no inherent limit on debate, and by the
eighteen-thirties senators had begun taking advantage of this loophole, derailing the proceedings by getting up and talking
until their voice, legs, or bladder gave out. (The word "filibuster' comes from vrijbuiter—old Dutch for "looter.")
In 1917, Woodrow Wilson, with his wartime legislative agenda blocked by filibusters, forced the Senate to pass Rule XXII,
which allowed a two-thirds majority to bring a floor debate to an end with a "cloture" vote. For decades, the rule was rarely
used; between 1919 and 1971, there were only forty-nine cloture votes, fewer than one per year. In the seventies and
eighties, the annual average rose to about a dozen. (Frustration with this increase led the Senate, in 1975, to lower the
threshold for cloture to sixty votes.) In the nineties and early aughts, the average went up to twenty-five or thirty a year, as
both parties escalated their use of the filibuster when they found themselves in the minority. After the Republicans lost
their majority in 2006, filibusters became everyday events: there were a hundred and twelve cloture votes in 2007 and
2008, and this session Republicans are on target to break their own filibuster record.
The tally of cloture votes reflects only a small fraction of senatorial obstruction. Three hundred and forty-five bills passed
by the House have been prevented from even coming up for debate in the Senate. "Why?" Steny Hoyer, the outraged
Democratic Majority Leader of the House, asked me. "Because they do not do their business in a way that facilitates
noncontroversial things. Thankfully, the House of Representatives is not becoming the Senate." Last week, six House
Democrats expressed their displeasure with the upper chamber by staging a sit-in of sorts on the Senate floor.
Seventy-six nominees for judgeships and executive posts have been approved by committees but, because of blocks,
haven't come up for a vote in the full Senate, leaving courtrooms idle and jobs unfilled across the upper levels of the
Obama Administration. (The Democrats also practiced the art of blocking nominees during the Bush Administration.)
There's often no objection to the individual being blocked: after an eight-month hold, Martha Johnson, nominated to run
the General Services Administration, was confirmed 96-0. On an issue like health-care reform, when the objection was
substantive, Republicans ransacked Riddick's "Senate Procedure" for every conceivable way to delay a debate and vote.
Judd Gregg even sent a memo on stalling tactics to his Republican colleagues. Tom Coburn demanded the reading aloud
of an entire seven-hundred-and-sixty-seven-page amendment proposed by Bernie Sanders, the Vermont socialist; Senate
clerks, working in half-hour shifts, were three hours into the chore when Sanders withdrew the amendment in frustration.
Under McConnell, Republicans have consistently consumed as much of the Senate's calendar as possible with legislative
maneuvering. The strategy is not to extend deliberation of the Senate's agenda but to prevent it. Tom Harkin, who first
proposed reform of the filibuster in 1995, called his Republican colleagues "nihilists," who want to create chaos because it
serves their ideology. "If there's chaos, things will tend toward simple solutions," Harkin said. "In chaos people don't listen
to reason." McConnell did not respond to requests for an interview, but he has often argued that the Republican strategy
reflects the views of a majority of Americans. In March, he told the Times, "To the extent that they"—the Democrats—
"want to do things that we think are in the political center and would be helpful to the country, we'll be helpful. To the
extent they are trying to turn us into a Western European country, we are not going to be helpful."
One of the mysteries of the Senate is how Mitch McConnell has been able to keep his members in line, on vote after vote.
Why do moderates with years of experience and their own power base back home—Richard Lugar, of Indiana; Susan
Collins, of Maine; George Voinovich, of Ohio—keep siding with the more extreme members of their caucus? Alexander
said that McConnell listens well to all his members, adding, "When you have your back against the wall and the gallows
are hanging in front of you, it tends to unify. Operating with forty members—it concentrates the mind."

Lindsey Graham described to the Times how McConnell exhorted his caucus after the disastrous 2008 election: "He said
if we didn't stick together on big things, we wouldn't be relevant." Last December, the Republicans decided to filibuster a
military-spending bill in order to delay the looming vote on health care until as close to Christmas as possible. Thad
Cochran, the Republican ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, promised Daniel Inouye, the chairman, that
he wouldn't join the effort. But at the last minute Cochran, who has been in the Senate since 1979 and brings
disproportionate amounts of defense money to Mississippi, told Reid that his leadership wouldn't allow him to vote with
the Democrats and end the filibuster—even on a matter of national security. (The Democrats were able to impose cloture,
and the vote on health care finally took place on Christmas Eve.)
Republican defections have been rare. In early 2009, Collins and Olympia Snowe, also of Maine, voted for the stimulus
bill, along with Arlen Specter (who promptly switched parties). Snowe also voted for the Finance Committee's health-care-
reform bill last October, the only Republican to do so. But in December, at the pivotal moment, she voted against the
version that went before the full Senate. "I wasn't interested in expanding this program beyond the Finance Committee
version—it grew by a thousand pages," Snowe said. She wasn't included in the negotiations with White House officials
that took place in an elegant conference room across from Reid's suite of offices, and said that the Democrats "did not
accept any of my proposals. As I said to the President, it was all windup and no pitch." McConnell was able to exploit her
alienation. A friend of Snowe cited another reason for her reversal: "She actually said to me once that she had never felt
the pressure that she felt on health care, never before had that pressure been quite as evident to her or quite as real or
troubling. Kyl and McConnell were saying things like 'You just can't let us down, we're all in this together. You're a senior
Republican member of this caucus, and you just have to hang tough with us. We expect it and you're going to do it.' "
Reid doesn't use such tough tactics; he has achieved his position, in spite of his public shortcomings, by being the senator
who helped other Democrats, always answered their calls, and got them what they wanted through masterly
maneuvering. This has made him enormously popular within the Democratic caucus, but it doesn't give him the leverage
of McConnell, let alone of Lyndon Johnson.
In the current Senate, it has become normal for a handful of senators, sometimes representing just ten or twenty per cent
of the country's population, to hold everything up. And the status quo has become sufficiently frustrating that a few new
senators have considered a radical option: mutiny.
Tom Udall, who is sixty-two, is older than most freshman senators. He has the crow's-feet of a Westerner who has spent
time in the sun, and a slow, good-natured voice. His father, Stewart, was an Arizona congressman and the Interior
Secretary for Presidents Kennedy and Johnson; his uncle Mo was a legendary Arizona representative; his cousin Mark is
a freshman senator from Colorado. Udall served five terms in the House before winning a Senate seat from New Mexico,
in 2008. And yet he has the air of a political Candide—he is always earnest, capable of disappointment but not cynicism.
"I ran on the idea that the Senate should not be a graveyard for good ideas," he said. "Then to be on the inside—the thing
that strikes you is how one senator can hold up the whole show."
In his first year in office, Udall decided to do something audacious: he would try to change the Senate's rules.
Customarily, the rules continue session after session, and a provision in Rule XXII requires sixty-seven votes to amend
them, making it extremely difficult. ("Rule XXII is a Catch-22," Ted Kennedy used to joke.) Udall embraced a different
idea—the "constitutional option." Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution states that "each House may determine the Rules
of its Proceedings" at the beginning of the new Congress. So, in theory, a senator could take the floor next January and
propose debating its rules from scratch, including the filibuster. New rules could be passed with a simple majority. There's
even a precedent for this: moves to revisit the rules by invoking the constitutional option have been made three times,
most recently in 1975. Udall has spent much of the past year trying to build support for the idea.
At the request of Udall and others, Schumer, who is the chairman of the Rules Committee, has held a series of hearings
on the filibuster, calling witnesses such as Sarah Binder, the historian, and Walter Mondale, who was in the Senate when
the constitutional option was invoked in 1975. Dick Durbin, the second-highest-ranking Democrat, has organized working
groups among newer members on other internal reforms, such as ending secret holds and choosing committee chairs by
caucus vote rather than by seniority. (Lamar Alexander wryly suggested to me that Schumer and Durbin were competing
for the favor of newer members, in case Harry Reid loses his seat in the fall and they run against each other for Majority
Leader.)
For Republican institutionalists, such as Alexander and Gregg, the push for rules reform is folly. "If you want a
parliamentary form of government, go over to the House," Gregg, who is about to retire, scoffed. "Why even run for the
Senate?" Udall's plan for next January, he said, would be a "gigantic mistake."
"They'll get over it," Alexander said of the Democrats' enthusiasm for rules reform. "And they'll get over it quicker if they're
in the minority next January. Because they'll instantly see the value of slowing the Senate down to consider whatever they
have to say." He added that the Senate "may be getting done about as much as the American people want done." The
President's ambitious agenda, after all, has upset a lot of voters, across the political spectrum. None of the Republicans I
spoke to agreed with the contention that the Senate is "broken." Alexander claimed that he and other Republicans were
exercising the moderating, thoughtful influence on legislation that the founders wanted in the Senate. "The Senate wasn't
created to be efficient," he argued. "It was created to be inefficient." At one of the filibuster hearings, in April, Alexander,
sitting across the table from Udall, said that, for all the times the Democrats charge the Republicans with obstructing
legislation, "we could say that's the number of times the majority has tried to cut off our right to debate, our right to offer
amendments, which is the essence of the Senate."

Newcomers like Udall seem to think that the Senate has grown so absurd and extreme that some kind of reform is
inevitable. Perhaps they need more time to plumb the depths of the institution's intransigence. According to Sarah Binder,
a change in rules is extremely unlikely; Republicans would be implacably opposed to, say, weakening the filibuster, and
so would some Democrats, especially long-serving ones. "I would oppose that," Chris Dodd said, adding of the freshmen,
"These are people who have never been in the minority." For older Democrats, who have put in their years, grown adept
at working the rules, and now chair powerful committees, the reform impulse could be a threat. (Among senior senators,
the sole enthusiast for rules reform is Tom Harkin.) One senator spoke of the Senate as being divided not between
whales and minnows but, rather, between bulls and calves. The older Democrats are too accustomed to the Senate's
ways to share the frustrations of the newcomers; the handful of older moderate Republicans are too weak to challenge the
newer radicals who now dominate the caucus.
Even if the freshmen Democrats can somehow reform the filibuster next January, the Senate will remain a sclerotic,
wasteful, unhappy body. The deepest source of its problems is not rules and precedents but, rather, its human beings,
who have created a culture where Tocqueville's "lofty thoughts" and "generous impulses" have no place.
A few days after passing health-care reform, the Senate struggled to its feet to take on a second large task. Financial
regulatory reform should have been the easiest piece of major legislation of the Obama Presidency, the likeliest to win
real bipartisan support. The financial crisis had been catastrophic for millions of Americans, and after the 2008 bailout
Wall Street had become even more hated than the Senate was. In April, a lineup of bankers from Goldman Sachs
appeared before Senator Levin's subcommittee on investigations, and managed to appear as arrogant, callous, and
evasive as their reputations had suggested. The public demanded action. Some Republicans had a genuine desire to
pass a bill. If health-care reform had been a war of attrition, financial reform was a promising liaison.
The affair began with a Republican, Bob Corker, and a Democrat, Mark Warner—both multimillionaires serving their first
term, both considered centrists. Corker is a small, dapper former construction magnate who became the mayor of
Chattanooga; Warner is a tall, preppily dressed former telecommunications entrepreneur who became the governor of
Virginia. Chris Dodd, the Banking Committee chairman, assigned them to work together on the section of the bill having to
do with the liquidation of troubled firms—making sure that there would never be another taxpayer bailout. They worked
through the winter, in Warner's office, in Corker's office, over dinner, sometimes without staff, as if they were members of
a Senate from the past. They hosted a series of afternoon seminars, inviting guests such as Ben Bernanke, Alan
Greenspan, and Sheila Bair. Corker and Warner were sometimes said to be the only Democrat and Republican still
talking to each other. In January, Business Week called them the Senate's "Odd Couple." By February, they had finished
their work.
Meanwhile, discussions about the entire bill between Dodd and Richard Shelby, the top Republican on the committee,
dragged on, repeatedly breaking down. Finally, on February 10th, Dodd called Corker, who, though he was one of the
committee's junior members, agreed to be the chairman's Republican negotiating partner. When Corker informed
McConnell and Shelby, they expressed surprise. "It was an odd place to be," Corker recalled. "And yet that night we
began meeting." The junior Republican savored the rare experience of creating, rather than opposing, legislation. In
response, Shelby's conservative staff tried to undermine Corker, spreading rumors among Republicans and their lobbyists
that he was giving too much away. (A Shelby aide said that staff members were simply informing other Republicans of the
Party's line on financial reform.)
On March 10th, Dodd concluded that he had to move a bill to the floor. He called Corker and said, "You've been a great
partner." He was ending their talks after only a month. "It's a little stunning, I've got to be honest," Corker told reporters
afterward. Someone close to the negotiations compared Corker to Dickens's Miss Havisham, unable to get over the
rebuff, forever awaiting the arrival of her groom, all her clocks stopped. Corker later said that Dodd had ended the talks
under pressure from the White House and other Democrats. Dodd said that Corker had been unable to bring any other
Republicans with him. "Baloney," Corker said. "If Dodd had reached an agreement with me, we'd've had at least twenty-
five Republican votes."
The bill that Dodd brought before the Senate, after a year of discussions with Democrats and Republicans alike,
incorporated the bipartisan plan of Warner and Corker to prevent another bank bailout: setting up a fifty-billion-dollar fund,
paid for by the banks, to insure orderly liquidation, and establishing a risk council to detect warning signs of another crisis.
But in mid-April Mitch McConnell—who had just met with Wall Street executives in New York, and was now parroting
talking points from a memo written by the Republican strategist Frank Luntz—called it a "partisan bill" that "will guarantee
perpetual taxpayer bailout of Wall Street banks." McConnell presented a letter, signed by all forty-one Republicans,
suggesting that they would filibuster the financial-reform bill.
His remarks amounted to a repudiation of Corker's work as well as of Dodd's. The next day, April 15th, Corker pleaded
with his colleagues, in his Tennessee twang, "Let's come to the floor and let's act like adults. Let's tone down the rhetoric.
Let's don't exaggerate the pluses or minuses. Let's do what the Senate was created to do. . . . We were supposed to be
the people that took some of the red-hot activities that sometimes come from the other body and sat down with cooler
heads and resolved the issues like adults. We can do that. As a matter of fact, I would say, if we cannot do that on
financial regulation, an issue that really doesn't have any real philosophical bearings to it . . ." Corker didn't allow the
thought to ripen—he had already gone farther than almost any Republican would have dared.
Dodd spoke later in the day and completed Corker's speech: "I know my friends on the other side of the aisle are faced
with a difficult choice between supporting their party leadership and participating in this complicated, difficult debate. I am
not naïve. I know that is a hard place to be. But if we can't act like U.S. senators for the sake of this issue . . . then why

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770192 Date: 08/31/2015
are we even here?" He went on, "We work for an American public that is sick and tired of feeling like no one is looking out
for their interests, like the political hacks and lobbyists hold all the cards in these discussions. The minority seems intent
on proving them right. . . . I have been here a long time. I know this institution is better than that. I know there are friends
of mine on the other side of the aisle who care about this bill, who want to be a part of the debate, who want to be part of
the solution."
In the same speech, Dodd joined the partisan fight, accusing McConnell of lying about the bill. Turning crimson-faced, he
chopped the air with his hand as he shouted, "I have to ask myself, why did I go through this process over the last four or
five months, agreeing to much of what they were offering, and there is not a single political vote to show for it. . . . I have
to say to the younger members, the newer members coming along: be careful!"
Corker, having heard that Dodd was speaking, returned to the chamber and asked to respond. "You and I went a long
way," Corker told Dodd. "Then we stopped. On March 10th it ended. I understand that, look, you were losing Democrats
on your committee."
"And I was not gaining Republicans," Dodd replied.
"You had one, and that is all you asked for when you started. I never said I could speak for anybody but myself. And I did
not leave the table." Corker urged Dodd to keep talking to Republicans—their differences could be sorted out in a few
days.
But this was not McConnell's agenda. Instead, financial reform became a slightly more polite repeat of the health-care-
reform brawl: the Republicans threatened filibusters, the Democrats threatened all-nighters, and thousands of lobbyists
prowled the Capitol, charging their Wall Street clients more than a billion dollars. On April 28th, I was sitting in the ornate
Reception Room with Jim Manley, Reid's spokesman. On the other side of the wall, there was the noise of furniture
scraping across a tile floor. "Those are cots being set up in the L.B.J. Room," Manley said. "Very little happens around
here without a deadline." The cots persuaded Republicans to allow the bill to move to the floor for debate. A few weeks
later, on May 20th, yet another filibuster was defeated by yet another cloture motion, and financial reform finally came to a
vote. It passed, 59-39. Only four Republicans had joined the majority. Corker wasn't among them. He had even voted for
an amendment, offered by his Republican colleague Jeff Sessions, of Alabama, that would have scrapped Corker's work
of many months with Warner.
"The idea of watching Bob Corker vote for the Sessions amendment!" Dodd said afterward, sitting in his red-curtained
office, under a print of Holbein's portrait of Thomas More. "It's the Senate, I guess." McConnell's strategy of obstruction
had once again come close to succeeding, Dodd said, but he knew that a "shrinking number" of Republicans were
frustrated. The previous day, Dodd had said to Susan Collins, "God, I would have loved to have you as my ranking
member on this." Collins responded, "We could have had such a great time on this bill."
Warner, who said that he believed in bipartisanship because "the American people don't trust either political party enough
to give them a blank check," was astonished that so few Republicans voted for financial reform. "There was zero
substantive reason why this couldn't have been eighty votes," he said. I asked him why Bob Corker had voted no on the
bill. Warner started to talk about the consumer-protection title, and then said, "If you want to vote against something, you
can always find your reasons."
But Corker hadn't seemed to want to vote against it. He had spent months trying to act like a U.S. senator, alienating
himself from his own party and then the other party, and on the day of the vote he held the floor for the better part of thirty
minutes, as if he were still reluctant to let the effort go. "I am obviously disappointed," he said. "I think I have spent as
much time as any senator. . . on policy regarding our financial system. I think any bill—even this bill—has good things in
it. There is no question. And I appreciate the thrust. But I think there is a lot of overreaching, and I think not enough time
was spent on some of the core issues."
As the senators cast their votes, I noticed Robert Kaiser, the author of "So Damn Much Money," in the press gallery. I later
asked him if, with the passage of two big reform bills in three months, we were witnessing a possible renewal of the
Senate. "If you can engage public opinion in a way politicians can understand, public opinion can still blow away money
and interest groups," he said. "But over the past few decades the reflex has grown in the Senate that, all things
considered, it's better to avoid than to take on big issues. This is the kind of thing that drives Michael Bennet nutty: here
you've arrived in the United States Senate and you can't do fuck-all about the destruction of the planet."
After the final vote on financial reform, the Republicans flew home, and the Democratic leaders held a press conference,
smiling before the microphones outside the Senate chamber. Reid said, "For those who wanted to protect Wall Street, it
didn't work." He then excused himself: he had to join Biden for a telephone fund-raiser with "some Nevadans."
Durbin said, "I was stunned that only four Republicans would join us in passing this historic legislation. What does it take
to bring the Republican Party into the conversation about the future of America?"
Dodd, glowing with triumph, said, "I wanted to demonstrate that the Senate of the United States could conduct its
business much as our founders intended. We did that."
On July 21st, President Obama signed the completed bill. The two lasting achievements of this Senate, financial
regulation and health care, required a year and a half of legislative warfare that nearly destroyed the body. They
depended on a set of circumstances—a large majority of Democrats, a charismatic President with an electoral mandate,
and a national crisis—that will not last long or be repeated anytime soon. Two days after financial reform became law,
Harry Reid announced that the Senate would not take up comprehensive energy-reform legislation for the rest of the year.
And so climate change joined immigration, job creation, food safety, pilot training, veterans' care, campaign finance,
transportation security, labor law, mine safety, wildfire management, and scores of executive and judicial appointments on

the list of matters that the world's greatest deliberative body is incapable of addressing. Already, you can feel the Senate
slipping back into stagnant waters.

The Political Scene
The Empty Chamber
Just how broken is the Senate?
Seventy-six nominees for judgeships and executive posts have been approved by committees but, because of blocks,
haven't come up for a vote in the full Senate, leaving courtrooms idle and jobs unfilled across the upper levels of the
Obama Administration....
The tally of cloture votes reflects only a small fraction of senatorial obstruction. Three hundred and forty-five bills
passed by the House have been prevented from even coming up for debate in the Senate....

"Sit and watch us for seven days," one senator says of the deadlocked chamber. "You know what you'll see happening?
Nothing."
"This is just one of those days when you want to throw up your hands and say, 'What in the world are we doing?'"
Senator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat, said.
"It's unconscionable," Carl Levin, the senior Democratic senator from Michigan, said. "The obstructionism has become
mindless."
The Senators were in the Capitol, sunk into armchairs before the marble fireplace in the press lounge, which is directly
behind the Senate chamber. It was four-thirty on a Wednesday afternoon. McCaskill, in a matching maroon jacket and
top, looked exasperated; Levin glowered over his spectacles.
"Also, it's a dumb rule in itself," McCaskill said. "It's time we started looking at some of these rules."
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015
She was referring to Senate Rule XXVI, Paragraph 5, which requires unanimous consent for committees and
subcommittees to hold hearings after two in the afternoon while the Senate is in session. Both Levin and McCaskill had
scheduled hearings that day for two-thirty. Typically, it wouldn't be difficult to get colleagues to waive the rule; a general
and an admiral had flown halfway around the world to appear before Levin's Armed Services Committee, and
McCaskill's Subcommittee on Contracting Oversight of the Homeland Security Committee was investigating the training
of Afghan police. But this was March 24th, the day after President Barack Obama signed the health-care-reform bill, in a
victory ceremony at the White House; it was also the day that the Senate was to vote on a reconciliation bill for health-
care reform, approved by the House three nights earlier, which would retroactively remove the new law's most
embarrassing sweetheart deals and complete the yearlong process of passing universal health care. Republicans, who
had fought the bill as a bloc, were in no mood to make things easy.
So, four hours earlier, when Levin went to the Senate floor and asked for consent to hold his hearing, Senator Richard
Burr, Republican of North Carolina, and a member of Levin's committee, had refused. "I have no personal objection to
continuing," Burr said. But, he added, "there is objection on our side of the aisle. Therefore, I would have to object."
Burr had to object on behalf of his party because he was the only Republican in the chamber when Levin spoke. In
general, when senators give speeches on the floor, their colleagues aren't around, and the two or three who might be
present aren't listening. They're joking with aides, or e-mailing Twitter ideas to their press secretaries, or getting their
first look at a speech they're about to give before the eight unmanned cameras that provide a live feed to C-SPAN2. The
presiding officer of the Senate—freshmen of the majority party take rotating, hour-long shifts intended to introduce
them to the ways of the institution—sits in his chair on the dais, scanning his BlackBerry or reading a Times article about
the Senate. Michael Bennet, a freshman Democrat from Colorado, said, "Sit and watch us for seven days—just watch the
floor. You know what you'll see happening? Nothing. When I'm in the chair, I sit there thinking, I wonder what they're
doing in China right now?"
Between speeches, there are quorum calls, time killers in which a Senate clerk calls the roll at the rate of one name
every few minutes. The press gallery, above the dais, is typically deserted, as journalists prefer to hunker down in the
press lounge, surfing the Web for analysis of current Senate negotiations; television screens alert them if something of
interest actually happens in the chamber. The only people who pay attention to a speech are the Senate stenographers.
On this afternoon, two portly bald men in suits stood facing the speaker from a few feet away, tapping at the
transcription machines, which resembled nineteenth-century cash registers, slung around their necks. The Senate
chamber is an intimate room where men and women go to talk to themselves for the record.
Like many other aspects of senatorial procedure, Rule XXVI, Paragraph 5 is a relic from the days when senators had to
hover around their desks to know what was happening on the floor during the main afternoon debate. (The desks, some
built as long ago as 1819, are mahogany, and their lids lift up, like those in an old schoolhouse; the desks of the Majority
and Minority Leader are still equipped with brass spittoons.) In the press lounge, McCaskill said, with light sarcasm,
"Somebody told me the rule is to make sure people pay attention to what's happening on the floor during debate and
not be distracted by committee work. Clearly, it's an old rule."
The Republicans had turned this old rule into a new means of obstruction. There would be no hearings that afternoon;
the general and the admiral would have to come back another day. Like investment bankers on Wall Street, senators
these days direct much of their creative energy toward the manipulation of arcane rules and loopholes, scoring short-
term successes while magnifying their institution's broader dysfunction.
Around five o'clock, the chamber began to fill, as the reconciliation bill came up for a vote; there were twenty-three
amendments pending, all from Republicans, and perhaps many more to come. Ordinarily, debate and voting on an
amendment might take two legislative days, but under the rules of the reconciliation bill the senators were to dispatch
the amendments one after another, as in a hot-dog-eating contest, with a minute of debate for each side. The goal was
to finish the bill by the end of the evening, so that senators wouldn't miss a day of their spring recess—apparently, the
only thing worse than a government takeover of the health-care system. The usual longueurs of the Senate, where forty
minutes can tick away on the antique clock above the rear double doors without a word's being spoken, were about to
yield to a frenzy. Harry Reid, the Majority Leader, from Nevada, had predicted that the process, known as Vote-O-Rama,
would go past two in the morning, and had warned senators to stay close to the chamber.
Max Baucus, of Montana, the manager of the bill for the Democrats, rose and said, "This is the first time in recent
memory that a reconciliation bill has all the amendments on one side only. These are clearly amendments designed to
kill the reconciliation and, therefore, kill health-care reform. So I very much hope that all of these amendments are
defeated."

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015
Tall, gaunt Judd Gregg, of New Hampshire, the bill's Republican manager, took the floor. "The position on the other side
of the aisle is: no amendments allowed, even if they are good," he said. Indignation rouged his cheeks, and his voice rose
half an octave. "Obviously, they presume the Republican Party is an inconvenience. The democratic process is an
inconvenience. It also appears, considering the opposition to this out in America, that the American people are an
inconvenience."
The Senate chamber is laid out in four concentric semicircles, with adjacent desks almost touching on the crowded
Democratic side, and the desks of the much smaller Republican minority spaced loosely apart. The design is meant to
emphasize the senators' unity. But Baucus and Gregg avoided eye contact across the six feet of aisle that now divides
the chamber into two constantly warring factions. Senators are required, by custom, to speak of one another in the third
person, directing their anger and sarcasm through whichever poor freshman happens to be the presiding officer at the
moment. Rule XIX, Paragraphs 2 and 3—one of the original rules drawn from Thomas Jefferson's "Manual of
Parliamentary Practice"—bars senators from imputing unworthy conduct or motives to another senator, and from
insulting any senator's state. But there is no rule against finger-wagging, and Baucus wagged his at Gregg while shouting
at Al Franken, of Minnesota, who had started a shift in the presiding officer's chair: "Mr. President, make no mistake, the
intent of every single one of the amendments offered on the other side of the aisle is to kill health-care reform.... A
senator on the other side of the aisle stood up and said that this is hopefully the President's Waterloo. They want to kill
health-care reform!"
The voice of Stuart Smalley filled the chamber: "The time of the senator has expired."
For the next nine hours, the chamber became the stage of a theatrical whose ending, like almost everything that
happens on the Senate floor, was known in advance to all. The Republican goal in Vote-O-Rama was to embarrass the
Democrats while appearing to suggest useful changes; the Democratic goal was to prevent any change to the bill, so that
it wouldn't have to return to the House, where it might be voted down. Several of the Republican amendments had
been designed to make Democrats look hypocritical, by forcing them to vote against policies that the Party typically
supports. One amendment, for example, declared that the health-care bill could not be linked to a tax hike on
individuals making less than two hundred thousand dollars a year. Other amendments were more nakedly partisan, and
outlandish. David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican, proposed an amendment that repealed the entire law. Senator Tom
Coburn, a Republican obstetrician from Oklahoma, introduced an amendment to insure that veterans diagnosed with
mental illness would not be denied the right to own firearms, and another to prevent "convicted child molesters, rapists,
and sex offenders" from buying erectile-dysfunction drugs with taxpayer funds. Coburn got through the minute he was
allotted to explain his Viagra amendment without cracking a smile. "This is not a game amendment," he insisted. "It
actually saves money."
So many senators snickered that the presiding officer banged his gavel for order.
"The amendment offered by the senator from Oklahoma makes a mockery of this Senate," Baucus declared. "It is a crass
political stunt aimed at making thirty-second commercials, not public policy." Baucus asked for the yeas and nays, and a
clerk called the roll at a ragged pace. "Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins." Thirty-five-second pause. "Mr. Conrad, Mr.
Corker." Ten seconds. "Mr. Cornyn." Senators pay no attention to the sound of their name; they cast votes when they're
so inclined—wandering in late, shuffling down the chamber's gentle blue-carpeted steps to the swarm of colleagues
milling about in the well, where the clerks sit at a table, and then holding a finger up or down. At one point, John
McCain—now just one of a hundred senators and struggling to stay in office—spent half a minute waving stiff-armed,
trying to catch the eye of a clerk so he could cast his vote. In the end, two Democrats—Evan Bayh, of Indiana, and Ben
Nelson, of Nebraska—joined the Republicans in opposing Viagra for sex offenders. The amendment was defeated.
The carpeting in the chamber absorbs voices, and during the long night one of the few that rose above the muffled
drone was that of Charles Schumer, who said to Gregg, "Get to work! Stop screwing around with health care!"
Sporadically, a sharp cackle emanated from Al Franken, who wandered the chamber, looking for Republicans he could
charm into laughing. Observed from the press gallery, the senators in their confined space began to resemble zoo
animals—Levin a shambling brown bear, John Thune a loping gazelle, Jim Bunning a maddened grizzly. Each one
displayed a limited set of behaviors: in conversations, John Kerry planted himself a few inches away, loomed, and
clamped his hands down on a colleague's shoulders. Joe Lieberman patted everyone on the back. It became clear which
senators were loners (Russ Feingold, Daniel Akaka) and which were social (Blanche Lincoln, Lindsey Graham); which
senators were important (Dick Durbin, Jon Kyl) and which were ignored (Bayh, Bunning).
Past midnight, Durbin slumped at his desk, one hand over his face, yawning painfully. Susan Collins was going through
her mail. Twenty-three amendments had been voted down, and the Republicans were proposing a fresh batch. "Can we
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015
get some order?" Bunning growled, before he introduced a proposal to let senior citizens opt out of parts of Medicare. It
was the only amendment that any Republicans joined the Democrats to defeat.
Harry Reid controls the Senate's schedule, but Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, who is the Minority Leader, can object.
Since nearly everything in the Senate depends on unanimous consent, the main business of the place is a continuous
negotiation between these two supremely unsentimental men. That night, they played a game of chicken: McConnell,
unsmiling, his eyes riveted ahead, held out the prospect of dozens more amendments; Reid, a former boxer, was
hunched and mumbling, playing rope-a-dope, vowing to fend off amendments all night. The two leaders left the
chamber to confer privately about how to proceed. Inside, the atmosphere of a slumber party set in. Debbie Stabenow,
of Michigan, her hand across her heart, sang a sentimental duet with Robert Menendez, of New Jersey. Exhaustion
momentarily eased the partisan divide. Claire McCaskill sat down beside Tom Coburn, held up an erect finger in his face,
as if casting her Viagra vote, then let it go limp. Coburn could be heard to joke, "The longest it lasted was thirty
seconds."
At two-forty-five in the morning, Reid suddenly declared the Senate adjourned. The Senate parliamentarian had just
found two small violations of the reconciliation rules, meaning that in the morning, despite the Democrats' efforts, the
bill would go back to the House for another vote. At the bang of the gavel, the senators fled. In the parking lot, on the
Capitol's northeast side, McCaskill climbed into her S.U.V. Levin, in a cramped sedan, was chauffeured off into the empty
streets. On a marble ledge near the exit, Arlen Specter sat alone, a ghost in a brown suit, staring straight ahead, as if
waiting for someone to take him away.
The Senate reconvened at 9:45 A.M. Around two in the afternoon, the members gathered for the final vote, and the
Democrats were giddy. Tom Harkin, of Iowa, and Christopher Dodd, of Connecticut, even exchanged a hug. "Everyone's
tired," Reid declared before the final vote. "This legislative fight is one for the record books." He was so fatigued that he
initially voted the wrong way. Lindsey Graham came in late, delaying the tally by ten minutes. "Way to go, Lindsey, way
to stretch it out," Sam Brownback told him. A few Republicans lingered and took in the moment, like players on the
losing team at the end of the World Series. After a year of work, health-care reform had passed, 56-43, and for a
moment the chamber's Tweeting pygmies had become legislative giants.
The Senate is often referred to as "the world's greatest deliberative body." Jeff Merkley, a freshman Democrat from
Oregon, said, "That is a phrase that I wince each time I hear it, because the amount of real deliberation, in terms of
exchange of ideas, is so limited." Merkley could remember witnessing only one moment of floor debate between a
Republican and a Democrat. "The memory I took with me was: 'Wow, that's unusual—there's a conversation occurring
in which they're making point and counterpoint and challenging each other.' And yet nobody else was in the chamber."
Tom Udall, a freshman Democrat from New Mexico, could not recall seeing a senator change another senator's mind.
"You would really need a good hour or two of extensive exchange among folks that really know the issue," he said.
Instead, a senator typically gives "a prepared speech that's already been vetted through the staff. Then another guy gets
up and gives a speech on a completely different subject." From time to time, senators of the same party carry on a
colloquy—"I would be interested in the distinguished senator from Iowa's view of the other side's Medicare Advantage
plan"—that has been scripted in advance by aides.
While senators are in Washington, their days are scheduled in fifteen-minute intervals: staff meetings, interviews, visits
from lobbyists and home-state groups, caucus lunches, committee hearings, briefing books, floor votes, fund-raisers.
Each senator sits on three or four committees and even more subcommittees, most of which meet during the same
morning hours, which helps explain why committee tables are often nearly empty, and why senators drifting into a
hearing can barely sustain a coherent line of questioning. All this activity is crammed into a three-day week, for it's an
unwritten rule of the modern Senate that votes are almost never scheduled for Mondays or Fridays, which allows
senators to spend four days away from the capital. Senators now, unlike those of several decades ago, often keep their
families in their home states, where they return most weekends, even if it's to Alaska or Idaho—a concession to endless
fund-raising, and to the populist anti-Washington mood of recent years. (When Newt Gingrich became Speaker of the
House, in 1995, he told new Republican members not to move their families to the capital.) Tom Daschle, the former
Democratic leader, said, "When we scheduled votes, the only day where we could be absolutely certain we had all one
hundred senators there was Wednesday afternoon."
Nothing dominates the life of a senator more than raising money. Tom Harkin, the Iowa Democrat, said, "Of any free
time you have, I would say fifty per cent, maybe even more," is spent on fund-raising. In addition to financing their own
campaigns, senators participate at least once a week in the Power Hour, during which they make obligatory calls on
behalf of the Party (in the Democrats' case, from a three-story town house across Constitution Avenue from the Senate
office buildings, since they're barred from using their own offices to raise money). Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee

Republican, insisted that the donations are never sufficient to actually buy a vote, but he added, "It sucks up time that a
senator ought to be spending getting to know other senators, working on issues."
In June, 2009, top aides to Max Baucus, whose Finance Committee was negotiating the health-care-reform bill, took
time to meet with two health-care lobbyists, who themselves were former Baucus aides. (Baucus received more than a
million dollars from the industry for his 2008 reelection campaign.) That month, according to Common Cause, industry
groups were spending $1.4 million.a day to lobby members of Congress. Udall, speaking of the corrosive effect of fund-
raising and lobbying, said, "People know it in their heart—they know this place is dominated by special interests. The
over-all bills are not nearly as bold because of the influence of money."
Daschle sketched a portrait of the contemporary senator who is too busy to think: "Sometimes, you're dialling for
dollars, you get the call, you've got to get over to vote, you've got fifteen minutes. You don't have a clue what's on the
floor, your staff is whispering in your ears, you're running onto the floor, then you check with your leader—you double
check—but, just to make triple sure, there's a little sheet of paper on the clerk's table: The leader recommends an aye
vote, or a no vote. So you've got all these checks just to make sure you don't screw up, but even then you screw up
sometimes. But, if you're ever pressed, 'Why did you vote that way?'—you just walk out thinking, Oh, my God, I hope
nobody asks, because I don't have a clue."
Aides, at the elbows of senators as they shuttle between their offices and the Capitol, have proliferated over the past
few decades, and they play a crucial role. Lamar Alexander, who has an office of fifty people, pointed out that staff
members, who are younger and often more ideological than their bosses, and less dependent on institutional
relationships, tend to push senators toward extremes. Often, aides are the main actors behind proposed legislation—
writing bills, negotiating the details—while the senator is relegated to repeating talking points on Fox or MSNBC.
One day in his office, Udall picked up some tabloids from his coffee table and waved them at me. "You know about all
these rags that cover the Hill, right?" he said, smiling. There are five dailies—Politico, The Hill, Roll Call, CongressDaily,
and CO Today—all of which emphasize insider conflict. The senators, who like to complain about the trivializing effect of
the "24/7 media," provide no end of fodder for it. The news of the day was what Udall called a "dust-up" between Scott
Brown, the freshman Massachusetts Republican, and a staffer for Jim DeMint, the arch-conservative from South
Carolina; the staffer had Tweeted that Brown was voting too often with the Democrats, leading Brown to confront
DeMint on the Senate floor over this supposed breach of protocol. Bloggers carry so much influence that many senators
have a young press aide dedicated to the care and feeding of online media. News about, by, and for a tiny kingdom of
political obsessives dominates the attention of senators and staff, while stories that might affect their constituents go
unreported because their home-state papers can no longer afford to have bureaus in Washington. Dodd, who came to
the Senate in 1981 and will leave next January, told me, "I used to have eleven Connecticut newspaper reporters who
covered me on a daily basis. I don't have one today, and haven't had one in a number of years. Instead, D.C. publications
only see me through the prism of conflict." Lamar Alexander described the effect as "this instant radicalizing of positions
to the left and the right."
Both Alexander and Gregg said that the Senate had been further polarized by the rising number of senators—now nearly
fifty—who come from the House, rather than from governorships or other positions where bipartisan cooperation is still
permissible. "A lot of senators don't understand the history or tradition of the institution," Gregg said. "Substantive,
thoughtful, moderate discussion is pushed aside."
Encumbered with aides, prodded by hourly jolts from electronic media, racing from the hearing room to the caucus
lunch to the Power Hour to the airport, senators no longer have the time, or perhaps the inclination, to get to know one
another—least of all, members of the other party. Friendships across party lines are more likely among the few spouses
who live in Washington. After Udall joined the Senate, last year, he was invited to dinner by Alexander, because Jill
Cooper Udall and Honey Alexander had become friends through a women's social club. It remains the only time Udall
has set foot in the house of a Republican senator. (Vice-President Joe Biden, in his autobiography, recalls that, in the
seventies, a bipartisan group of senators and their wives hosted a monthly dinner: "In those days Democrats and
Republicans actually enjoyed each other's company.") When I asked Chris Dodd how well he knew, for example, Jim
DeMint, Dodd said, "Not at all. Whereas Jesse Helms and I knew each other pretty well." He repeated something that
Jon Kyl, the Republican whip, from Arizona, had recently said to him: "There's no trust." Dodd, whose father was a
senator, went on, "That's really all there is—this place really operates on that. I don't think anyone would argue with
that conclusion. And if that's missing ... "
There remains a veneer—badly chipped—of comity. On the floor, senators still refer to members of the opposing party
as "friends." Gregg described Kent Conrad, a Democrat from North Dakota, as "one of my best friends in the Senate,"
and both Gregg and Alexander ticked off examples of little-known legislation that they are currently working on with

Democrats; Alexander and Ben Cardin, of Maryland, have introduced a bill to ban mountaintop-removal coal mining.
Udall noted that he had become friendly with John McCain when they went on a congressional tour of Iraq. But
opportunities to bond are rare. On the first floor of the Capitol, there is a private dining room for senators, the "inner
sanctum," where Republicans and Democrats used to have lunch (at separate tables, but in the same room). In the
seventies, old bulls such as James Eastland, Hubert Humphrey, and Jacob Javits held court there; later, Daniel Patrick
Moynihan did. "You learned, and also you found out what was going on," Dodd said, adding, "It's awfully difficult to say
crappy things about someone that you just had lunch with." These days, the inner sanctum is nearly always empty.
Senators eat lunch in their respective caucus rooms with members of their party, or else "downtown," which means
asking donors for money over steak and potatoes at the Monocle or Charlie Palmer. The tradition of the "caucus lunch"
was instituted by Republicans in the fifties, when they lost their majority; Democrats, after losing theirs in 1980,
followed suit. Caucus lunches work members on both sides into a state of pep-rally fervor. During one recent Republican
lunch, Jim Bunning referred to Harry Reid as an idiot. "At least he had the courtesy to do it behind closed doors,"
Alexander joked, adding, "We spend most of our time in team meetings deciding what we're going to do to each other."
In 2007, Alexander and Lieberman started a series of bipartisan Tuesday breakfasts. "They kind of dwindled off during
the health-care debate," Alexander said. Udall has tried to revive the Wednesday inner-sanctum lunch. For the first few
months, only Democrats attended. Then, one Wednesday in May, Susan Collins, the Maine Republican, showed up,
joking nervously about being a turncoat; to protect her reputation, her presence was kept secret.
These efforts at resurrecting dead customs are as self-conscious and, probably, as doomed as the get-togethers of lovers
who try to stay friends after a breakup. Ira Shapiro, a Washington lawyer and a former aide to Senator Gaylord Nelson,
of Wisconsin, put it this way: "Why would they want to have lunch together when they hate each other?"
The upper chamber of Congress was a constitutional compromise between popular sovereignty and state sovereignty.
The Senate was designed, as part of the separation of powers, to check the impulses of the House and the popular will.
For some Federalists, it also had an aristocratic purpose: to collect knowledge and experience, and to guard against a
levelling spirit that might overtake the majority. When Alexis de Tocqueville visited the Senate, in 1832, he was deeply
impressed by the quality of its members: "They represent only the lofty thoughts [of the nation] and the generous
instincts animating it, not the petty passions." But he also recognized that "a minority of the nation dominating the
Senate could completely paralyze the will of the majority represented in the other house, and that is contrary to the
spirit of constitutional government." As long as the Senate continued to be composed of America's most talented
statesmen, Tocqueville implied, it would restrain its own anti-democratic potential.
Robert A. Caro, in "Master of the Senate," the third volume of his life of Lyndon Johnson, argues that after the Civil War
the Senate was captured by wealthy and sectional interests, ending a more high-minded age when Daniel Webster,
Henry Clay, and John C. Calhoun engaged in brilliant debate. Aside from spasms of legislation at the start of the
Presidencies of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt, Caro writes, the Senate remained controlled by an alliance of
Southern racists and Republican corporate shills, and was "the dam against which the waves of social reform dashed
themselves in vain—the chief obstructive force in the federal government." By the fifties, the Senate had become far
more conservative than the public. And not just conservative: William S. White, in his 1956 book "Citadel," called the
Senate "to a most peculiar degree, a Southern Institution ... growing at the heart of this ostensibly national assembly"
and "the only place in the country where the South did not lose the war."
By mid-century, it had become a journalistic cliché to call the Senate broken. Otto Preminger's 1962 film "Advise and
Consent," based on the novel by Allen Drury, is about the Senate of that period, and it presents Democrats and
Republicans as equally amoral, calculating, and power-hungry. But the institution, as depicted by Preminger, still works,
in its way: though the deals stink, they get cut. The senators know their colleagues and the rules; they back-stab one
another in the lunchroom, then drink cocktails and play cards on Saturday nights. There are no lobbyists, no fund-
raisers, no media, no constituents—only senators' intricate relations with one another. The Senate is its own world.
In a memoir, Johnson's longtime aide Harry McPherson recalls learning that the Senate's "famous 'club' atmosphere is
based on the members' mutual acceptance of responsibility and concentration on the tasks at hand.... They thrust
hard at one another in debate over serious matters," but, he writes, "understanding and accommodation in the ordinary
course of the Senate day was essential to sanity." Johnson, the most powerful Majority Leader in history, bent the
Senate to his will and forced it to become more efficient. He saw his colleagues as either "whales"—the heavyweight
chairmen who negotiated legislation—or "minnows," the followers who went along with the brokered deals. And when,
in 1958, a formidable new class of liberal Democrats entered the Senate—including Edmund Muskie, Eugene McCarthy,
and Philip Hart—the legislative machinery began to produce reform. Michael Janeway, the author of "The Fall of the
House of Roosevelt," worked as a summer staff member between 1958 and 1962. "They used to talk to each other—

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015
that's my most vivid recollection," he said. "If Wayne Morse talked of constitutional law on the floor, the Southerners
would come in to hear him. The same with Hubert Humphrey on farm policy. My strongest impression was of it being a
deliberative body, drawing each other out—sometimes pedantically." Senators who ran for office in order to work on
foreign policy, social welfare, or urbanization had to win credibility with the whales. "But if you wanted to do something
there was a mechanism by which you could do it," Janeway said.
In the sixties and seventies, Southern-conservative control was broken by a coalition of left-of-center Democrats and
moderate Republicans. Donald Ritchie, the Senate historian, who started working there in 1976, described the Senate of
those decades as "a bipartisan liberal institution." The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was written largely out of the office of the
Republican Minority Leader, Everett Dirksen. Every major initiative—voting rights, open housing, environmental law,
campaign reform—enjoyed bipartisan support. In the rare event of a filibuster, the motion to end debate was often filed
jointly by leaders of both parties. When Medicare—that government takeover of health care for the elderly—was
passed, in 1965, it won 70-24.
The Senate's momentum nurtured superb talent: William Fulbright, Everett Dirksen, Henry Jackson, Frank Church,
Howard Baker. In 1969, George McGovern chaired a select committee on hunger that actually held bipartisan "field
hearings" in poor regions, calling witnesses in migrant labor camps, and then, with Bob Dole's indispensable support,
greatly expanded the food-stamp program. The intensity of senatorial purpose in those years must strike today's
legislators as profoundly humbling. After Joe Biden came to the Senate, in 1973, Hubert Humphrey took him aside and
said, "You have to pick an issue that becomes yours. That's how you attract your colleagues to follow you, Joe. That's
how you demonstrate your bona fides. Don't be a gadfly." Humphrey's career advice: "You should become Mr. Housing.
Housing is the future."
The Senate's modern decline began in 1978, with the election of a new wave of anti-government conservatives, and
accelerated as Republicans became the majority in 1981. "The Quayle generation came in, and there were a number of
people just like Dan—same generation, same hair style, same beliefs," Gary Hart, the Colorado Democrat, recalled.
"They were harder-line. They weren't there to get along with Democrats. But they look accommodationist compared to
Republicans in the Senate today." Church, McGovern, Javits, and Birch Bayh were gone. Ira Shapiro, the former aide,
who is writing a book about the Senate of the sixties and seventies, said, "It was a huge loss of the most experienced,
accomplished senators being replaced by neophytes. All of a sudden, in 1981, more than half the Senate had been there
less than six years." He added, "The shattering of the great Senate has long-term effects that keep showing up. It gets
worse over time, but it just never gets restored. There was a phrase I heard from Helms and the younger ones: 'Others
didn't want to make waves; I wanted to drain the swamp.'"
After C-SPAN went on the air, in 1979, the cozy atmosphere that encouraged both deliberation and back-room deals
began to yield to transparency and, with it, posturing. "So Damn Much Money," a recent book by the Washington Post
reporter Robert G. Kaiser, traces the spectacular rise of Washington lobbying to the same period. Liberal Republicans
began to disappear, and as Southern Democrats died out they were replaced by conservative Republicans. Bipartisan
coalitions on both wings of the Senate vanished. The institutionalist gave way to the free agent, who controlled his own
fund-raising apparatus and media presence, and whose electoral base was a patchwork of single-issue groups. Members
of both parties—Howard Metzenbaum, the Ohio Democrat; Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican—took to
regularly using the Senate's rules to tie up business for narrowly ideological reasons. The number of filibusters shot up in
the eighties and continued to rise in the following decades, as the parties kept alternating control of the Senate and
escalating a procedural arms race, routinely blocking the confirmation of executive and judicial appointees. Democrats
filibustered Republican nominees to the bench; then Republicans threatened to ban the filibuster in such cases—the so-
called "nuclear option." Older members were perturbed when, in 2004, the Republican Majority Leader, Bill Frist, went
to South Dakota to campaign against the Democratic Minority Leader, Tom Daschle (who went on to lose). A few years
earlier, such an action would have been unthinkable.
The weakened institution could no longer withstand pressures from outside its walls; as money and cameras rushed in,
independent minds fell more and more in line with the partisans. Rough parity between the two parties meant that
every election had the potential to make or break a majority, crushing the incentive to cooperate across the aisle. The
Senate, no longer a fount of ideas, became a backwater of the U.S. government. During the Clinton years, the main
action was between the White House and the Gingrich House of Representatives; during the Bush years, the Republican
Senate majority abdicated the oversight role that could have placed a vital check on executive power.
Norman Ornstein, a congressional expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said that the Senate has increasingly
become populated by "ideologues and charlatans." He went on, "When we do get good people who come in, they very
quickly get ground up by the dynamic and the culture of the parties. And once you get there, look at what it takes to stay
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015

there." He spoke of Charles Grassley, the Iowa Republican, who, nearing the end of his career, spent much of last year
working closely with his friend Max Baucus on the health-care bill. Then, in August, Grassley went home and, faced with
angry Republican voters and the prospect of a primary challenge from the right, started warning about "pulling the plug
on Grandma." Ornstein added that similar pressures had led John McCain to begin "altering his behavior and
abandoning every issue, including campaign-finance reform."
One morning in April, I visited Harry McPherson, the former L.B.J. aide, at the offices of the legal and lobbying firm D. L.
A. Piper, in downtown Washington. McPherson, who is eighty, had on his desk the firm's spiral-bound directory for the
111th Congress. I asked him who, in Johnsonian terms, were the whales of the current Senate. McPherson ran his finger
down the list of senators. He did it again. "I'm trying here, looking for a remote descendant. Judas Priest, look at this."
He was stumped. "Well, I see some good people, I see some people who are going to get coalitions together over time."
He put the directory aside. "I'm just having the damnedest time."
Down the hall from McPherson's office was that of Mel Martinez, a former Republican senator from Florida; he was
hired last year, two weeks after resigning his Senate seat without completing his first term. (He has since moved on to
JPMorgan Chase.) William Cohen, the former Maine senator and Secretary of Defense, has an office downstairs. Tom
Daschle works at D. L. A. Piper; his predecessor as Democratic leader, George Mitchell, was the firm's chairman, until
President Obama appointed him to be his Middle East envoy. One feature of the diminished U.S. senator is the ease with
which he moves from legislating to lobbying. Between 1998 and 2004, half the senators who left office became
lobbyists. In 2007, Trent Lott, a Republican leader in the Senate less than a year into his fourth term, abruptly resigned
and formed a lobbying firm with former Senator John Breaux, just a few weeks before a new law took effect requiring a
two-year waiting period between serving and lobbying.
When you spend your days at the Senate, it's easy to forget about everything else. The House of Representatives seems
miles away (it's just down a corridor and across the rotunda), the White House is another country, and actual foreign
countries are unimaginable. The place remains insular, labyrinthine, and opaque—even physically. Senators commute
thirty seconds between their offices and the chamber by electric subway cars that run along a tunnel under Constitution
Avenue. Many signs are misleading or obsolete (the gilded lettering over the visitors' gallery says "Men's Gallery"), and
the Capitol is filled with secret passageways and spare rooms, called hideaways, doled out according to seniority, where
senators can read, drink, doze, and wait for the buzzer announcing an imminent vote. The most pervasive authority over
the institution is not the Constitution or the Bible but, rather, an impenetrable sixteen-hundred-page tome, by Floyd M.
Riddick, called "Senate Procedure: Precedents and Practices," which only the late Robert Byrd, of West Virginia, was
known to have read in its entirety. The procedures are so abstruse that a parliamentarian must sit below the presiding
officer and, essentially, tell him or her what to say.
After half a century, the picture given by Preminger's "Advise and Consent" is still faintly visible. "The Senate, by its
nature, is a place where consensus reigns and personal relationships are paramount," Lamar Alexander said. "And that's
not changed." Which is exactly the problem: it's a self-governing body that depends on the reasonableness of its
members to function. Sarah Binder, a congressional scholar at George Washington University, said, "To have a chamber
that rules by unanimous consent—it's nutty! Especially when you've got Jim Bunning to please."
In 2006 and 2008, sixteen Democrats entered the Senate, giving the Party its current majority of fifty-nine to forty-one
(counting two independents). They include moderates, like Jon Tester, of Montana, and Mark Warner, of Virginia;
liberals, like Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, and Sheldon Whitehouse, of Rhode Island; policy specialists, like Amy Klobuchar, of
Minnesota, and Jeff Merkley; and iconoclasts, like Claire McCaskill. Their interest in legislating has won the admiration of
senior senators. "If they can stay, I think they'll be terrific," Chris Dodd said. "My worry is they won't stay. Because it's
not productive."
The Democratic class of 2008 arrived with President Obama, expecting to usher in a dynamic new era. Instead, their
young Senate careers have passed in a daily slog of threatened filibusters and "secret holds"—when a senator
anonymously objects to bringing an appointment up for a vote, which requires unanimous consent. On April 20th, Claire
McCaskill took the trouble to read off the names of fifty-six Obama nominees languishing in the limbo of secret holds,
and Jon Kyl objected to every one of them. Just getting a bill to the floor for debate can require days of tactical
gamesmanship between the party leaders. There were times when Warner wondered if anyone had ever quit in the first
year. Michael Bennet said, "We find ourselves at a moment in our history when the questions are huge ones, not small
ones, and where things have been put off for a really long period of time." He mentioned the national debt, energy
policy, and the financial crisis. "Yet you have a Senate that's designed not to advance change but to slow it."
We were talking in his hideaway, a windowless room in the Capitol basement, which had a mini-fridge stocked with
bottled water, black leatherette furniture circa 1962, and a TV tuned to C-SPAN2 on mute; Senator Kyl's mouth was

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015
moving. Bennet, the former superintendent of schools in Denver, was appointed to a vacant seat in 2009, and already
has to defend it this year. He described the Senate with the dry bluntness of an outsider who hasn't allowed himself to
grow too attached. Bennet repeated a story he had heard about a new congressman giving his maiden speech: "And
then some more veteran guy came over and said, 'Son, you're talking like this place is on the level. It's not on the level.'
As the fifteen months or so have gone by that I've been here, the less on the level it seems."
Earlier this year, the Senate's procedural absurdities became national news twice in one month. On February 4th,
CongressDaily reported that Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican, was secretly blocking the confirmation of seventy
Obama appointees over a dispute involving defense earmarks for his state. (His tactics exposed, Shelby—whose office
maintains that he was responsible for fewer than fifty holds—lifted all but three.) Later that month, Bunning spent
several days and a late night on the Senate floor, filibustering to prevent benefits from being paid to millions of
unemployed Americans. When Merkley tried to reason with him, Bunning responded, "Tough shit." (Eventually,
Republicans persuaded Bunning to stop.)
These incidents elicited a brief outcry, but the extent of the Senate's routine folly remains largely hidden. For example,
Grassley and Ron Wyden, of Oregon, have been trying since 1997 to end the practice of secret holds, without success. In
2007, the Senate passed a bill banning secret holds that last longer than six days. But to get around the ban two or more
senators can pass the hold back and forth—it's called "rolling holds"—and their party leader facilitates the game by
keeping their names secret.
Many of the Senate's antique rules and precedents have been warped beyond recognition by the modern pressures of
partisanship. The hold, for example, was a courtesy extended to senators in the days of horse travel, when they needed
time to get back to Washington and read a bill or question an appointee before casting their vote. Sarah Binder, who co-
authored a book on the filibuster, calls the procedure a historical accident: in 1806, the Senate got rid of a little-used
rule that allowed the "previous question" to be called to a vote. Suddenly, there was no inherent limit on debate, and by
the eighteen-thirties senators had begun taking advantage of this loophole, derailing the proceedings by getting up and
talking until their voice, legs, or bladder gave out. (The word "filibuster" comes from vrijbuiter—old Dutch for "looter.")
In 1917, Woodrow Wilson, with his wartime legislative agenda blocked by filibusters, forced the Senate to pass Rule XXII,
which allowed a two-thirds majority to bring a floor debate to an end with a "cloture" vote. For decades, the rule was
rarely used; between 1919 and 1971, there were only forty-nine cloture votes, fewer than one per year. In the seventies
and eighties, the annual average rose to about a dozen. (Frustration with this increase led the Senate, in 1975, to lower
the threshold for cloture to sixty votes.) In the nineties and early aughts, the average went up to twenty-five or thirty a
year, as both parties escalated their use of the filibuster when they found themselves in the minority. After the
Republicans lost their majority in 2006, filibusters became everyday events: there were a hundred and twelve cloture
votes in 2007 and 2008, and this session Republicans are on target to break their own filibuster record.
The tally of cloture votes reflects only a small fraction of senatorial obstruction. Three hundred and forty-five bills
passed by the House have been prevented from even coming up for debate in the Senate. "Why?" Steny Hoyer, the
outraged Democratic Majority Leader of the House, asked me. "Because they do not do their business in a way that
facilitates noncontroversial things. Thankfully, the House of Representatives is not becoming the Senate." Last week, six
House Democrats expressed their displeasure with the upper chamber by staging a sit-in of sorts on the Senate floor.
Seventy-six nominees for judgeships and executive posts have been approved by committees but, because of blocks,
haven't come up for a vote in the full Senate, leaving courtrooms idle and jobs unfilled across the upper levels of the
Obama Administration. (The Democrats also practiced the art of blocking nominees during the Bush Administration.)
There's often no objection to the individual being blocked: after an eight-month hold, Martha Johnson, nominated to
run the General Services Administration, was confirmed 96-0. On an issue like health-care reform, when the objection
was substantive, Republicans ransacked Riddick's "Senate Procedure" for every conceivable way to delay a debate and
vote. Judd Gregg even sent a memo on stalling tactics to his Republican colleagues. Tom Coburn demanded the reading
aloud of an entire seven-hundred-and-sixty-seven-page amendment proposed by Bernie Sanders, the Vermont socialist;
Senate clerks, working in half-hour shifts, were three hours into the chore when Sanders withdrew the amendment in
frustration.
Under McConnell, Republicans have consistently consumed as much of the Senate's calendar as possible with legislative
maneuvering. The strategy is not to extend deliberation of the Senate's agenda but to prevent it. Tom Harkin, who first
proposed reform of the filibuster in 1995, called his Republican colleagues "nihilists," who want to create chaos because
it serves their ideology. "If there's chaos, things will tend toward simple solutions," Harkin said. "In chaos people don't
listen to reason." McConnell did not respond to requests for an interview, but he has often argued that the Republican
strategy reflects the views of a majority of Americans. In March, he told the Times, "To the extent that they"—the

Democrats—"want to do things that we think are in the political center and would be helpful to the country, we'll be
helpful. To the extent they are trying to turn us into a Western European country, we are not going to be helpful."
One of the mysteries of the Senate is how Mitch McConnell has been able to keep his members in line, on vote after
vote. Why do moderates with years of experience and their own power base back home—Richard Lugar, of Indiana;
Susan Collins, of Maine; George Voinovich, of Ohio—keep siding with the more extreme members of their caucus?
Alexander said that McConnell listens well to all his members, adding, "When you have your back against the wall and
the gallows are hanging in front of you, it tends to unify. Operating with forty members—it concentrates the mind."
Lindsey Graham described to the Times how McConnell exhorted his caucus after the disastrous 2008 election: "He said
if we didn't stick together on big things, we wouldn't be relevant." Last December, the Republicans decided to filibuster
a military-spending bill in order to delay the looming vote on health care until as close to Christmas as possible. Thad
Cochran, the Republican ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, promised Daniel Inouye, the chairman, that
he wouldn't join the effort. But at the last minute Cochran, who has been in the Senate since 1979 and brings
disproportionate amounts of defense money to Mississippi, told Reid that his leadership wouldn't allow him to vote with
the Democrats and end the filibuster—even on a matter of national security. (The Democrats were able to impose
cloture, and the vote on health care finally took place on Christmas Eve.)
Republican defections have been rare. In early 2009, Collins and Olympia Snowe, also of Maine, voted for the stimulus
bill, along with Arlen Specter (who promptly switched parties). Snowe also voted for the Finance Committee's health-
care-reform bill last October, the only Republican to do so. But in December, at the pivotal moment, she voted against
the version that went before the full Senate. "I wasn't interested in expanding this program beyond the Finance
Committee version—it grew by a thousand pages," Snowe said. She wasn't included in the negotiations with White
House officials that took place in an elegant conference room across from Reid's suite of offices, and said that the
Democrats "did not accept any of my proposals. As I said to the President, it was all windup and no pitch." McConnell
was able to exploit her alienation. A friend of Snowe cited another reason for her reversal: "She actually said to me once
that she had never felt the pressure that she felt on health care, never before had that pressure been quite as evident to
her or quite as real or troubling. Kyl and McConnell were saying things like 'You just can't let us down, we're all in this
together. You're a senior Republican member of this caucus, and you just have to hang tough with us. We expect it and
you're going to do it.'"
Reid doesn't use such tough tactics; he has achieved his position, in spite of his public shortcomings, by being the
senator who helped other Democrats, always answered their calls, and got them what they wanted through masterly
maneuvering. This has made him enormously popular within the Democratic caucus, but it doesn't give him the leverage
of McConnell, let alone of Lyndon Johnson.
In the current Senate, it has become normal for a handful of senators, sometimes representing just ten or twenty per
cent of the country's population, to hold everything up. And the status quo has become sufficiently frustrating that a
few new senators have considered a radical option: mutiny.
Tom Udall, who is sixty-two, is older than most freshman senators. He has the crow's-feet of a Westerner who has spent
time in the sun, and a slow, good-natured voice. His father, Stewart, was an Arizona congressman and the Interior
Secretary for Presidents Kennedy and Johnson; his uncle Mo was a legendary Arizona representative; his cousin Mark is
a freshman senator from Colorado. Udall served five terms in the House before winning a Senate seat from New Mexico,
in 2008. And yet he has the air of a political Candide—he is always earnest, capable of disappointment but not cynicism.
"I ran on the idea that the Senate should not be a graveyard for good ideas," he said. "Then to be on the inside—the
thing that strikes you is how one senator can hold up the whole show."
In his first year in office, Udall decided to do something audacious: he would try to change the Senate's rules.
Customarily, the rules continue session after session, and a provision in Rule XXII requires sixty-seven votes to amend
them, making it extremely difficult. ("Rule XXII is a Catch-22," Ted Kennedy used to joke.) Udall embraced a different
idea—the "constitutional option." Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution states that "each House may determine the
Rules of its Proceedings" at the beginning of the new Congress. So, in theory, a senator could take the floor next January
and propose debating its rules from scratch, including the filibuster. New rules could be passed with a simple majority.
There's even a precedent for this: moves to revisit the rules by invoking the constitutional option have been made three
times, most recently in 1975. Udall has spent much of the past year trying to build support for the idea.
At the request of Udall and others, Schumer, who is the chairman of the Rules Committee, has held a series of hearings
on the filibuster, calling witnesses such as Sarah Binder, the historian, and Walter Mondale, who was in the Senate when
the constitutional option was invoked in 1975. Dick Durbin, the second-highest-ranking Democrat, has organized
working groups among newer members on other internal reforms, such as ending secret holds and choosing committee

chairs by caucus vote rather than by seniority. (Lamar Alexander wryly suggested to me that Schumer and Durbin were
competing for the favor of newer members, in case Harry Reid loses his seat in the fall and they run against each other
for Majority Leader.)
For Republican institutionalists, such as Alexander and Gregg, the push for rules reform is folly. "If you want a
parliamentary form of government, go over to the House," Gregg, who is about to retire, scoffed. "Why even run for the
Senate?" Udall's plan for next January, he said, would be a "gigantic mistake."
"They'll get over it," Alexander said of the Democrats' enthusiasm for rules reform. "And they'll get over it quicker if
they're in the minority next January. Because they'll instantly see the value of slowing the Senate down to consider
whatever they have to say." He added that the Senate "may be getting done about as much as the American people
want done." The President's ambitious agenda, after all, has upset a lot of voters, across the political spectrum. None of
the Republicans I spoke to agreed with the contention that the Senate is "broken." Alexander claimed that he and other
Republicans were exercising the moderating, thoughtful influence on legislation that the founders wanted in the Senate.
"The Senate wasn't created to be efficient," he argued. "It was created to be inefficient." At one of the filibuster
hearings, in April, Alexander, sitting across the table from Udall, said that, for all the times the Democrats charge the
Republicans with obstructing legislation, "we could say that's the number of times the majority has tried to cut off our
right to debate, our right to offer amendments, which is the essence of the Senate."
Newcomers like Udall seem to think that the Senate has grown so absurd and extreme that some kind of reform is
inevitable. Perhaps they need more time to plumb the depths of the institution's intransigence. According to Sarah
Binder, a change in rules is extremely unlikely; Republicans would be implacably opposed to, say, weakening the
filibuster, and so would some Democrats, especially long-serving ones. "I would oppose that," Chris Dodd said, adding of
the freshmen, "These are people who have never been in the minority." For older Democrats, who have put in their
years, grown adept at working the rules, and now chair powerful committees, the reform impulse could be a threat.
(Among senior senators, the sole enthusiast for rules reform is Tom Harkin.) One senator spoke of the Senate as being
divided not between whales and minnows but, rather, between bulls and calves. The older Democrats are too
accustomed to the Senate's ways to share the frustrations of the newcomers; the handful of older moderate
Republicans are too weak to challenge the newer radicals who now dominate the caucus.
Even if the freshmen Democrats can somehow reform the filibuster next January, the Senate will remain a sclerotic,
wasteful, unhappy body. The deepest source of its problems is not rules and precedents but, rather, its human beings,
who have created a culture where Tocqueville's "lofty thoughts" and "generous impulses" have no place.
A few days after passing health-care reform, the Senate struggled to its feet to take on a second large task. Financial
regulatory reform should have been the easiest piece of major legislation of the Obama Presidency, the likeliest to win
real bipartisan support. The financial crisis had been catastrophic for millions of Americans, and after the 2008 bailout
Wall Street had become even more hated than the Senate was. In April, a lineup of bankers from Goldman Sachs
appeared before Senator Levin's subcommittee on investigations, and managed to appear as arrogant, callous, and
evasive as their reputations had suggested. The public demanded action. Some Republicans had a genuine desire to pass
a bill. If health-care reform had been a war of attrition, financial reform was a promising liaison.
The affair began with a Republican, Bob Corker, and a Democrat, Mark Warner—both multimillionaires serving their first
term, both considered centrists. Corker is a small, dapper former construction magnate who became the mayor of
Chattanooga; Warner is a tall, preppily dressed former telecommunications entrepreneur who became the governor of
Virginia. Chris Dodd, the Banking Committee chairman, assigned them to work together on the section of the bill having
to do with the liquidation of troubled firms—making sure that there would never be another taxpayer bailout. They
worked through the winter, in Warner's office, in Corker's office, over dinner, sometimes without staff, as if they were
members of a Senate from the past. They hosted a series of afternoon seminars, inviting guests such as Ben Bernanke,
Alan Greenspan, and Sheila Bair. Corker and Warner were sometimes said to be the only Democrat and Republican still
talking to each other. In January, Business Week called them the Senate's "Odd Couple." By February, they had finished
their work.
Meanwhile, discussions about the entire bill between Dodd and Richard Shelby, the top Republican on the committee,
dragged on, repeatedly breaking down. Finally, on February 10th, Dodd called Corker, who, though he was one of the
committee's junior members, agreed to be the chairman's Republican negotiating partner. When Corker informed
McConnell and Shelby, they expressed surprise. "It was an odd place to be," Corker recalled. "And yet that night we
began meeting." The junior Republican savored the rare experience of creating, rather than opposing, legislation. In
response, Shelby's conservative staff tried to undermine Corker, spreading rumors among Republicans and their

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770194 Date: 08/31/2015
lobbyists that he was giving too much away. (A Shelby aide said that staff members were simply informing other
Republicans of the Party's line on financial reform.)
On March 10th, Dodd concluded that he had to move a bill to the floor. He called Corker and said, "You've been a great
partner." He was ending their talks after only a month. "It's a little stunning, I've got to be honest," Corker told reporters
afterward. Someone close to the negotiations compared Corker to Dickens's Miss Havisham, unable to get over the
rebuff, forever awaiting the arrival of her groom, all her clocks stopped. Corker later said that Dodd had ended the talks
under pressure from the White House and other Democrats. Dodd said that Corker had been unable to bring any other
Republicans with him. "Baloney," Corker said. "If Dodd had reached an agreement with me, we'd've had at least twenty-
five Republican votes."
The bill that Dodd brought before the Senate, after a year of discussions with Democrats and Republicans alike,
incorporated the bipartisan plan of Warner and Corker to prevent another bank bailout: setting up a fifty-billion-dollar
fund, paid for by the banks, to insure orderly liquidation, and establishing a risk council to detect warning signs of
another crisis. But in mid-April Mitch McConnell—who had just met with Wall Street executives in New York, and was
now parroting talking points from a memo written by the Republican strategist Frank Luntz—called it a "partisan bill"
that "will guarantee perpetual taxpayer bailout of Wall Street banks." McConnell presented a letter, signed by all forty-
one Republicans, suggesting that they would filibuster the financial-reform bill.
His remarks amounted to a repudiation of Corker's work as well as of Dodd's. The next day, April 15th, Corker pleaded
with his colleagues, in his Tennessee twang, "Let's come to the floor and let's act like adults. Let's tone down the
rhetoric. Let's don't exaggerate the pluses or minuses. Let's do what the Senate was created to do.... We were
supposed to be the people that took some of the red-hot activities that sometimes come from the other body and sat
down with cooler heads and resolved the issues like adults. We can do that. As a matter of fact, I would say, if we cannot
do that on financial regulation, an issue that really doesn't have any real philosophical bearings to it ..." Corker didn't
allow the thought to ripen—he had already gone farther than almost any Republican would have dared.
Dodd spoke later in the day and completed Corker's speech: "I know my friends on the other side of the aisle are faced
with a difficult choice between supporting their party leadership and participating in this complicated, difficult debate. I
am not naïve. I know that is a hard place to be. But if we can't act like U.S. senators for the sake of this issue ... then
why are we even here?" He went on, "We work for an American public that is sick and tired of feeling like no one is
looking out for their interests, like the political hacks and lobbyists hold all the cards in these discussions. The minority
seems intent on proving them right.... I have been here a long time. I know this institution is better than that. I know
there are friends of mine on the other side of the aisle who care about this bill, who want to be a part of the debate,
who want to be part of the solution."
In the same speech, Dodd joined the partisan fight, accusing McConnell of lying about the bill. Turning crimson-faced, he
chopped the air with his hand as he shouted, "I have to ask myself, why did I go through this process over the last four
or five months, agreeing to much of what they were offering, and there is not a single political vote to show for it.... I
have to say to the younger members, the newer members coming along: be careful!"
Corker, having heard that Dodd was speaking, returned to the chamber and asked to respond. "You and I went a long
way," Corker told Dodd. "Then we stopped. On March 10th it ended. I understand that, look, you were losing Democrats
on your committee."
"And I was not gaining Republicans," Dodd replied.
"You had one, and that is all you asked for when you started. I never said I could speak for anybody but myself. And I did
not leave the table." Corker urged Dodd to keep talking to Republicans—their differences could be sorted out in a few
days.
But this was not McConnell's agenda. Instead, financial reform became a slightly more polite repeat of the health-care-
reform brawl: the Republicans threatened filibusters, the Democrats threatened all-nighters, and thousands of lobbyists
prowled the Capitol, charging their Wall Street clients more than a billion dollars. On April 28th, I was sitting in the
ornate Reception Room with Jim Manley, Reid's spokesman. On the other side of the wall, there was the noise of
furniture scraping across a tile floor. "Those are cots being set up in the L.B.J. Room," Manley said. "Very little happens
around here without a deadline." The cots persuaded Republicans to allow the bill to move to the floor for debate. A
few weeks later, on May 20th, yet another filibuster was defeated by yet another cloture motion, and financial reform
finally came to a vote. It passed, 59-39. Only four Republicans had joined the majority. Corker wasn't among them. He
had even voted for an amendment, offered by his Republican colleague Jeff Sessions, of Alabama, that would have
scrapped Corker's work of many months with Warner.

"The idea of watching Bob Corker vote for the Sessions amendment!" Dodd said afterward, sitting in his red-curtained
office, under a print of Holbein's portrait of Thomas More. "It's the Senate, I guess." McConnell's strategy of obstruction
had once again come close to succeeding, Dodd said, but he knew that a "shrinking number" of Republicans were
frustrated. The previous day, Dodd had said to Susan Collins, "God, I would have loved to have you as my ranking
member on this." Collins responded, "We could have had such a great time on this bill."
Warner, who said that he believed in bipartisanship because "the American people don't trust either political party
enough to give them a blank check," was astonished that so few Republicans voted for financial reform. "There was zero
substantive reason why this couldn't have been eighty votes," he said. I asked him why Bob Corker had voted no on the
bill. Warner started to talk about the consumer-protection title, and then said, "If you want to vote against something,
you can always find your reasons."
But Corker hadn't seemed to want to vote against it. He had spent months trying to act like a U.S. senator, alienating
himself from his own party and then the other party, and on the day of the vote he held the floor for the better part of
thirty minutes, as if he were still reluctant to let the effort go. "I am obviously disappointed," he said. "I think I have
spent as much time as any senator.
... on policy regarding our financial system. I think any bill—even this bill—has good
things in it. There is no question. And I appreciate the thrust. But I think there is a lot of overreaching, and I think not
enough time was spent on some of the core issues."
As the senators cast their votes, I noticed Robert Kaiser, the author of "So Damn Much Money," in the press gallery. I
later asked him if, with the passage of two big reform bills in three months, we were witnessing a possible renewal of
the Senate. "If you can engage public opinion in a way politicians can understand, public opinion can still blow away
money and interest groups," he said. "But over the past few decades the reflex has grown in the Senate that, all things
considered, it's better to avoid than to take on big issues. This is the kind of thing that drives Michael Bennet nutty: here
you've arrived in the United States Senate and you can't do fuck-all about the destruction of the planet."
After the final vote on financial reform, the Republicans flew home, and the Democratic leaders held a press conference,
smiling before the microphones outside the Senate chamber. Reid said, "For those who wanted to protect Wall Street, it
didn't work." He then excused himself: he had to join Biden for a telephone fund-raiser with "some Nevadans."
Durbin said, "I was stunned that only four Republicans would join us in passing this historic legislation. What does it take
to bring the Republican Party into the conversation about the future of America?"
Dodd, glowing with triumph, said, "I wanted to demonstrate that the Senate of the United States could conduct its
business much as our founders intended. We did that."
On July 21st, President Obama signed the completed bill. The two lasting achievements of this Senate, financial
regulation and health care, required a year and a half of legislative warfare that nearly destroyed the body. They
depended on a set of circumstances—a large majority of Democrats, a charismatic President with an electoral mandate,
and a national crisis—that will not last long or be repeated anytime soon. Two days after financial reform became law,
Harry Reid announced that the Senate would not take up comprehensive energy-reform legislation for the rest of the
year. And so climate change joined immigration, job creation, food safety, pilot training, veterans' care, campaign
finance, transportation security, labor law, mine safety, wildfire management, and scores of executive and judicial
appointments on the list of matters that the world's greatest deliberative body is incapable of addressing. Already, you
can feel the Senate slipping back into stagnant waters.

Re: Sunday, State of Play
Clegg is still in talks with Cameron. About 1,500 Liberal Democrats spontaneously protested at Lib-Dem
headquarters against a deal with the Tories given their policies, especially on Europe. But Clegg remains in
negotiations. He seems quite intent on working it out with Cameron, it appears. His inner Tory magnetically
draws him to his heritage. Clegg has also misplayed almost every turn, presented with big chances and blowing
them through a combination of inexperience (derived partly from heading a party out of power for nearly 100
years) and inbred arrogance (from no less a privileged background than Cameron, though seeming less snobbish
because he went to Westminster instead of Eton and has a less pronounced upper-class accent, more neutral,
because of his more cosmopolitan roots through his family).
What about Labour? Shaun and a couple of others have rounded up about 29 votes from other parties (Scottish
National Party, NI parties, Welsh party) that could be part of a grand progressive once-in-a-lifetime coalition
that required the LDs. Gordon has said he will allow Clegg-Cameron discussions to play out and a general offer
to Clegg is on the table, its terms giving far more on a referendum and policy than the Tories. Behind the
scenes, Labour is putting whatever harsh pressure it can on LD leaders. Peter is playing a cynical double game.
He is a sectarian in a sect of one. Yet Gordon for strange psychological reasons rooted in his triangle with Tony
and Peter relies on Peter. Peter, according to Shaun, has wrung a pledge from Borwn that if Brown emerges
from this crisis he, Peter, will replace David as Foreign Secretary. Meanwhile, Peter has advised David to
sideline himself David has done so instead of being forward as a strong party man behind Brown in dire straits.
Standing back only makes David look ambitious, waiting for Brown to lose and aiming to a leadership contest
afterward, when Peter, as he has promised, would guide David to the prize. The plot thickens: Ed Miliband,
David's younger brother, the environment secretary, will runfor leader against his brother if Brown loses. Ed
has more of a common touch. The outcome of that contest would be more than uncertain. But before that
eventuality Gordon's team reaches out to the LDs in private. Yet Shaun's attitude, as I read it, leans toward
pessmism. A London Times polls just out says 62 percent want Gordon out. Where were the fickle voters in the

election? The poll shows more than discontent with Gordon, but also how people are being whipped by the
Murdoch media.
What about the Tories? A secret memo from William Hague to Cameron written before the election was leaked
this morning to The Observer (the Sunday paper of The Guardian), proposes an anti-Europe line of the new
government. (I've enclosed the article below.) The atmosphere inside the Conservatives is acrid and anxious.
But Lord Ashcroft, the Tory moneyman, who spent five million pounds alone in marginal districts, is furious
that Cameron failed to win outright, failed in his campaign, made a foolish decision to include Clegg in the
debates, etc. Many agree with the evil Ashcroft. But the finger pointing won't matter if a deal works with
Clegg. The Conservative strategy would be to coopt Clegg now, do whatever deal can be done, maintain a more
or less center-right but moderated government for about a year, call a new election, win outright on the
momentum of the recovery engineered by Brown but claimed by Tories as proof that the change was
responsible, jettison Clegg and the LDs, and govern from the radical right as the children of Thatcher for five
years. The Tories would then move on their electoral reforms: cutting the number of seats in Parliament,
redistricting in Conservative favor, and trying to outlaw union contributions to the Labour Party.
What about the LDs? Clegg's deal with the Tories would of course thwart any Lib-Lab coalition, probably the
only chance for a grand progressive alliance that would keep the Tories out of power forever. Clegg's personal
instincts obviously lean toward the Tories, having little to do with policy. The party's leaders may be opposed,
but they are also likely to be feckless and weak as they always have been.
So, whatever the case, I would doubt you'll see David again as Foreign Secretary. Prepare for hauge, who is
deeply anti-European and will be disingenuous with you. Tory budget cuts in NI, already announced, would
cause havoc with peace and economic recovery. I'd send a private message asap on that score the second a new
government is announced, if it is. Tilt publicly to Merkel on Europe for this reason among others.

Tory-Lib Dem coalition threatened by secret
hardline memo on Europe
•Draft letter by William Hague sets out tough stance on EU
•Leak follows leaders"constructive, amicable' meeting
Toby Helm and Anushka Asthana
• The Observer, Sunday 9 May 2010
David Cameron's hopes of forming a coalition with the Liberal Democrats were dramatically undermined last
night by the leaking of a top-secret letter outlining the hardline Eurosceptic stance he and William Hague
planned to adopt in government.
The document, obtained by the Observer, is headed "draft letter from Foreign Secretary to Prime Minister" and
was written last week. It assumed an outright Tory victory and spelt out how Hague intended to adopt a tough
approach to Europe at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels tomorrow.
In the letter, compiled by civil servants but written in the first person, Hague tells Cameron how his message
would be that "the British relationship with the EU has changed with our election" to one firmly against any
further integration.
Exposing the massive gulf between Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg and the Conservative leadership on
Europe, Hague says he would demand the right to repatriate powers over criminal justice as well as social and
employment policy during the first term of a Tory government — demands many EU leaders say they would
resist.
Hague planned to tell his EU counterparts: "Rest assured that we seek engagement, not confrontation. But our
aim is to achieve these commitments during this parliament." He would also tell his first foreign ministers'
meeting "we will never join the euro" and conclude: "You will find us firm but fair, playing a leading role,
fighting our corner, practical and straight-talking."

Last night the Tories said they had no knowledge of the letter. But the Observer understands it was drawn up on
the basis of detailed briefings between senior civil servants and Hague. The document came to light as Clegg, a
strong pro-European, yesterday met his MPs and senior party figures to discuss a possible coalition with the
Tories, who emerged from Thursday's general election with the largest number of seats but short of an overall
majority.
Cameron and Clegg held face-to-face talks late yesterday as they continued their attempts to thrash out a power-
sharing deal. A senior Conservative party spokeswoman said the talks were "constructive and amicable". The
70-minute meeting took place at Admiralty House in Whitehall. A Lib Dem spokesman also described the
discussions as "constructive and amicable".
Tory and Lib Dem sources said last night that discussions would not conclude until the beginning of the coming
week at the earliest. An emergency meeting of the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers will be held tomorrow
to discuss the possible coalition. Today, Hague, Oliver Letwin and George Osborne will resume talks with the
Lib Dems' Vince Cable, Chris Huhne and David Laws.
But the stark language used in the letter is bound to alarm Clegg, who has been savage in his criticism of the
Conservatives' attitude to Europe which he believes is rooted in the past and will limit Britain's ability to fight
cross-border crime and meet the environmental challenges of the 21st century.
The document will also be seen by Lib Dem MPs and the party's rank and file as evidence that their pro-
Europeanism would be compromised by linking up with the Tories. A Lib Dem spokesman said the party was
strongly pro-European, but would not be drawn on the document.
Yesterday Cameron came under pressure from senior figures in his own party not to give in to Clegg's demands
by watering down Conservative manifesto commitments. Shadow defence secretary Liam, Fox warned that a
Tory government could not be "held to ransom" by Lib Dems demanding proportional representation.
Clegg may also face opposition from within his party to any attempt to form a coalition with the Tories,
particularly on economic issues.
Yesterday the Social Liberal Forum, which represents left-leaning Lib Dems and includes a third of the party's
MPs, issued a set of "red lines" which it said the party must not cross, including any measure that would
increase the gap between the rich and poor — ruling out supporting the Tory pledge to cut inheritance tax. Three
other red lines were any suggestion of cuts to frontline services in the current financial year, any worsening
treatment of asylum seekers and any watering-down of the human rights act.
Meanwhile, Gordon Brown and his closest advisers were working on how to expand their counter-offer to the
Lib Dems, including a referendum on changes to the voting system. Senior officials said Labour was planning
to draw up a formal "coalition contract" — as happens in Germany — that would bind the Lib Dems and other
smaller parties into a deal if the Tory discussions with the Lib Dems were to fail.
Most Labour ministers now believe Brown would have to step down before Clegg would consider a pact,
though senior government insiders insisted this was not being discussed as an option.
One re-elected Labour MP, John Mann, of Bassetlaw, called on Brown to step down as Labour leader, claiming
that the party would have influence on the outcome of the current negotiations only if Brown agreed to give up
the leadership.
"Brown should not lead Labour into any future election and he should stand down before the next Labour party
conference," he said. "Gordon Brown's continuation as leader rules out the credibility of a Lib-Lab pact that has
to prioritise the modernisation and reform of the antiquated UK political systems."

that if Brown emerges from this crisis he, Peter, will replace David as Foreign Secretary.
Meanwhile, Peter has advised David to sideline himself. David has done so instead of being
forward as a strong party man behind Brown in dire straits. Standing back only makes David
look ambitious, waiting for Brown to lose and aiming to a leadership contest afterward, when
Peter, as he has promised, would guide David to the prize. The plot thickens: Ed Miliband,
David's younger brother, the environment secretary, will run for leader against his brother if
Brown loses. Ed has more of a common touch. The outcome of that contest would be more than
uncertain. But before that eventuality Gordon's team reaches out to the LDs in private. Yet
Shaun's attitude, as I read it, leans toward pessmism. A London Times polls just out says 62
percent want Gordon out. Where were the fickle voters in the election? The poll shows more
than discontent with Gordon, but also how people are being whipped by the Murdoch media.

What about the Tories? A secret memo from William Hague to Cameron written before the
election was leaked this morning to The Observer (the Sunday paper of The Guardian), proposes
an anti-Europe line of the new government. (I've enclosed the article below.) The atmosphere
inside the Conservatives is acrid and anxious. But Lord Ashcroft, the Tory moneyman, who
spent five million pounds alone In marginal districts, is furious that Cameron failed to win
outright, failed in his campaign, made a foolish decision to include Clegg in the debates, etc.
Many agree with the evil Ashcroft. But the finger pointing won't matter if a deal works with
Clegg. The Conservative strategy would be to coopt Clegg now, do whatever deal can be done,
maintain a more or less center-right but moderated government for about a year, call a new
election, win outright on the momentum of the recovery engineered by Brown but claimed by
Tories as proof that the change was responsible, jettison Clegg and the LDs, and govern from the
radical right as the children of Thatcher for five years. The Tories would then move on their
electoral reforms: cutting the number of seats in Parliament, redistricting in Conservative favor,
and trying to outlaw union contributions to the Labour Party.
What about the LDs? Clegg's deal with the Tories would of course thwart any Lib-Lab coalition,
probably the only chance for a grand progressive alliance that would keep the Tories out of
power forever. Clegg's personal instincts obviously lean toward the Tories, having little to do
with policy. The party's leaders may be opposed, but they are also likely to be feckless and weak
as they always have been.
So, whatever the case, I would doubt you'll see David again as Foreign Secretary. Prepare for
hauge, who is deeply anti-European and will be disingenuous with you. Tory budget cuts in NI,
already announced, would cause havoc with peace and economic recovery. I'd send a private
message asap on that score the second a new government is announced, if it is. Tilt publicly to
Merkel on Europe for this reason among others.

Tory-Lib Dem coalition threatened by secret
hardline memo on Europe
•Draft letter by William Hague sets out tough stance on EU
•Leak follows leaders"constructive, amicable' meeting
Toby Helm and Anushka Asthana
• The Observer, Sunday 9 May 2010
David Cameron's hopes of forming a coalition with the Liberal Democrats were dramatically
undermined last night by the leaking of a top-secret letter outlining the hardline Eurosceptic
stance he and William Hague planned to adopt in government.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770244 Date: 08/31/2015
The document, obtained by the Observer, is headed "draft letter from Foreign Secretary to Prime
Minister" and was written last week. It assumed an outright Tory victory and spelt out how
Hague intended to adopt a tough approach to Europe at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in
Brussels tomorrow.
In the letter, compiled by civil servants but written in the first person, Hague tells Cameron how
his message would be that "the British relationship with the EU has changed with our election"
to one firmly against any further integration.
Exposing the massive gulf between Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg and the Conservative
leadership on Europe, Hague says he would demand the right to repatriate powers over criminal
justice as well as social and employment policy during the first term of a Tory government —
demands many EU leaders say they would resist.
Hague planned to tell his EU counterparts: "Rest assured that we seek engagement, not
confrontation. But our aim is to achieve these commitments during this parliament." He would
also tell his first foreign ministers' meeting "we will never join the euro" and conclude: "You will
find us firm but fair, playing a leading role, fighting our corner, practical and straight-talking."
Last night the Tories said they had no knowledge of the letter. But the Observer understands it
was drawn up on the basis of detailed briefings between senior civil servants and Hague. The
document came to light as Clegg, a strong pro-European, yesterday met his MPs and senior party
figures to discuss a possible coalition with the Tories, who emerged from Thursday's general
election with the largest number of seats but short of an overall majority.
Cameron and Clegg held face-to-face talks late yesterday as they continued their attempts to
thrash out a power-sharing deal. A senior Conservative party spokeswoman said the talks were
"constructive and amicable". The 70-minute meeting took place at Admiralty House in
Whitehall. A Lib Dem spokesman also described the discussions as "constructive and amicable".
Tory and Lib Dem sources said last night that discussions would not conclude until the
beginning of the coming week at the earliest. An emergency meeting of the 1922 committee of
Tory backbenchers will be held tomorrow to discuss the possible coalition. Today, Hague, Oliver
Letwin and George Osborne will resume talks with the Lib Dems' Vince Cable, Chris Huhne and
David Laws.
But the stark language used in the letter is bound to alarm Clegg, who has been savage in his
criticism of the Conservatives' attitude to Europe which he believes is rooted in the past and will
limit Britain's ability to fight cross-border crime and meet the environmental challenges of the
21st century.
The document will also be seen by Lib Dem MPs and the party's rank and file as evidence that
their pro-Europeanism would be compromised by linking up with the Tories. A Lib Dem
spokesman said the party was strongly pro-European, but would not be drawn on the document.

Yesterday Cameron came under pressure from senior figures in his own party not to give in to
Clegg's demands by watering down Conservative manifesto commitments. Shadow defence
secretary Liam Fox warned that a Tory government could not be "held to ransom" by Lib Dems
demanding proportional representation.
Clegg may also face opposition from within his party to any attempt to form a coalition with the
Tories, particularly on economic issues.
Yesterday the Social Liberal Forum, which represents left-leaning Lib Dems and includes a third
of the party's MPs, issued a set of "red lines" which it said the party must not cross, including
any measure that would increase the gap between the rich and poor — ruling out supporting the
Tory pledge to cut inheritance tax. Three other red lines were any suggestion of cuts to frontline
services in the current financial year, any worsening treatment of asylum seekers and any
watering-down of the human rights act.
Meanwhile, Gordon Brown and his closest advisers were working on how to expand their
counter-offer to the Lib Dems, including a referendum on changes to the voting system. Senior
officials said Labour was planning to draw up a formal "coalition contract" — as happens in
Germany — that would bind the Lib Dems and other smaller parties into a deal if the Tory
discussions with the Lib Dems were to fail.
Most Labour ministers now believe Brown would have to step down before Clegg would
consider a pact, though senior government insiders insisted this was not being discussed as an
option.
One re-elected Labour MP, John Mann, of Bassetlaw, called on Brown to step down as Labour
leader, claiming that the party would have influence on the outcome of the current negotiations
only if Brown agreed to give up the leadership.
"Brown should not lead Labour into any future election and he should stand down before the
next Labour party conference," he said. "Gordon Brown's continuation as leader rules out the
credibility of a Lib-Lab pact that has to prioritise the modernisation and reform of the antiquated
UK political systems."

Re: Sunday, State of Play
Clegg is still in talks with Cameron. About 1,500 Liberal Democrats spontaneously protested at Lib-Dem headquarters
against a deal with the Tories given their policies, especially on Europe. But Clegg remains in negotiations. He seems
quite intent on working it out with Cameron, it appears. His inner Tory magnetically draws him to his heritage. Clegg has
also misplayed almost every turn, presented with big chances and blowing them through a combination of inexperience
(derived partly from heading a party out of power for nearly 100 years) and inbred arrogance (from no less a privileged
background than Cameron, though seeming less snobbish because he went to Westminster instead of Eton and has a
less pronounced upper-class accent, more neutral, because of his more cosmopolitan roots through his family).

What about Labour? Shaun and a couple of others have rounded up about 29 votes from other parties (Scottish National
Party, NI parties, Welsh party) that could be part of a grand progressive once-in-a-lifetime coalition that required the
LDs. Gordon has said he will allow Clegg-Cameron discussions to play out and a general offer to Clegg is on the table, its
terms giving far more on a referendum and policy than the Tories. Behind the scenes, Labour is putting whatever harsh
pressure it can on LD leaders. Peter is playing a cynical double game. He is a sectarian in a sect of one. Yet Gordon for
strange psychological reasons rooted in his triangle with Tony and Peter relies on Peter. Peter, according to Shaun, has
wrung a pledge from Borwn that if Brown emerges from this crisis he, Peter, will replace David as Foreign Secretary.

Gordon was convinced he had to sacrifice himself for any attempt to form a grand progressive coalition with the Lib-Dems.
Clegg had said during the campaign he would not deal with Gordon and he remained adamant. Peter, Alastair, Ed Balls,
and Ed Miliband met secretly with the LD team on Sunday. Gordon decided to fall on his sword today. The negotiations
between Labour and the LDs now are engaged with the same teams. The Tories at the same time also are negotiating.
Both offer competing plans for electoral reform that would give the LDs more representation in the future. If the LDs strike
a deal with the Tories Labour is unlikely to support it and campaign against that referendum. Cameron is strained right
now. His right does not approve of a deal while others push him to make an arrangement in order to attain power.
Cameron may be limited in how far he can go in his offer. But by no means is a Labour-LD deal certain or even probable,
even given Gordon's political suicide. The campaign for leader to replace Gordon begins as soon as the Labour-LD
negotiations are concluded. David is ready to go; he will face Ed Balls and possibly his brother Ed. If there is a coalition
that would tilt against Balls, who is seen as Gordon's heir and as an inappropriate PM, Gordon redux, to work with the
LDs. One of the Milibands will emerge. I still bet on David. So four days after the election, everything is still in play. Sid

Re: The day after Gordon
Whatever the outcome, whichever party ultimately makes a pact with the Lib-Dems, or whether neither does,
the next British government will be remarkably weak, flimsy and fly apart within months. That is the only
certainty now.
On Gordon's political suicide, David, Labour: Neither David Miliband nor Shaun (who has been constantly on
the phone with Gordon and by his side since the election as a sort of therapist) were privy to the decision; nor
did Gordon tell either before making his announcement on the steps of No. 10. Gordon's confidant in
contemplating his end was only Peter, the penultimate scene (there must be at least one more) of their twisted
relationship rooted in the Tony-Gordon-Peter triangle now transmuted into the perverse Gordon-Peter-David
triangle. David is the heir, the son, "Our Boy," as Anji Hunter describes him to me, playing a version of the
Tony role. Shaun and David met alone for an hour and a half late last night to discuss the whole situation. David
is well aware of Peter's perversity, that Peter has been plotting to usurp his position as foreign secretary, that
Peter seeks to direct his campaign as leader, that Peter wishes to be the arbiter and controlling figure in a
government under David. At this point, David does not want Peter to run his campaign but involved. Does Peter
know this? No. David is wary of a deal with the Lib-Dems and understands his perilous position in the event he
were to become leader as the second unelected PM in a row. Upon reflection, it may be that a Labour-Lib-Dem
alliance would not be the harbinger of a grand progressive coalition, but an illusion under these circumstances.
If an arrangement were to be made the government would be extraordinarily unstable. Because it would be
subject to the demands of every bit player, the government would have the potential of collapsing over every
issue large or small. It could not last long. Under the stress, the result might be that in an inevitable election to
be held six to eighteen months (at the outside) from now, the Conservatives would be posed to gain the majority
just beyond their grasp. Shaun advised David to work things out with his brother Ed, trying to persuade him not
to compete against him. If Ed runs for leader against David, Ed Balls, Gordon's heir in the same sense that

David is Tony's, might get through, which would put Labour back at square one, bearing the burden of Gordon
again.
Meanwhile, Peter negotiates with the LD team, a meeting that has broken up by this afternoon. Meanwhile, the
Scottish National Party, which two days ago was eager to lead the way to a coalition with Labour, the LDs, and
other parties, has announced it has dropped out of any arrangment, which also means the Welsh national party,
its partner, has dropped out. Meanwhile, David Blunkett, former Labour home secretary, has denounced any
deal with the LDs. Meanwhile, some prominent LDs have denounced a Labour-LD coalition as a "coalition of
the defeated" and a deal with the Tories as "the only game in town." Meanwhile, Clegg met privately with
Cameron this morning while Peter, et al were meeting with the LD negotiators. Meanwhile, this afternoon,
Cameron has upped his offer to the LDs on a referendum, insisting today is "decision time." Meanwhile, the
Tory right denounces any deal with the LDs. Meanwhile, Clegg dithers.
It has been said of the Lib-Dem Party that anytime anyone tries to use it, it simply crumbles in their hands. So
far, so good. I suspect for the party that allies with the LDs, the deal will be a poisoned chalice.
More to come soon...

Meanwhile, this afternoon, Cameron has upped his offer to the LDs on a referendum, insisting
today is "decision time." Meanwhile, the Tory right denounces any deal with the LDs.
Meanwhile, Clegg dithers.
It has been said of the Lib-Dem Party that anytime anyone tries to use it, it simply crumbles in
their hands. So far, so good. I suspect for the party that allies with the LDs, the deal will be a
poisoned chalice.
More to come soon...

Re: British election
First and most important: Do NOT, repeat, NOT, call any prospective winner on either Election
Night, May 6, or on the next day, Friday, May 7. The result will be unclear. It will not be clear,
even perhaps by Friday afternoon. Today, the combined polls show Cameron and the
Conservatives ahead but not winning an outright majority. The latest Guardian poll, out
tomorrow, shown me by Alan Rusbridger today, has the Tories falling short of a majority of
seats. Even if Cameron were to win an outright majority, Brown and Labour will attempt to
make a deal with Clegg and the Liberal Democrats. Brown remains as Prime Minister unless the
Tories win outright, which take a long time to determine. Labour and the Lib-Dems will almost
certainly gain about 60 percent of the vote, more or less. Brown will reach out to Clegg to stay in
power. The deal will be that Brown will approve a referendum on proportional representation
giving the LDs much greater representationin future elections. That will spell the end forever of
the Tories ever coming to power. The Tories see the election in apocalyptic terms—and they are
not wrong. Brown's weakness heralds the sort of grand progressive coalition/alliance that Tony
imagined but was never able to attempt between Labour and the LDs. Brown offering the
referendum would be the first step toward that. In the case of the Tories falling short of an
outright majority in seats, they will respond as though Brown is acting illegitimately, which he
would not be by remaining as PM and dealing with Clegg. Informed people are already talking
of what might begin to unfold on Friday as "Florida." The Tories, backed by the Murdoch press,
will attempt to push Labour aside by force majeure—something that will not succeed under those
circumstances. The Murdochs are almost literally going crazy. James Murdoch and hiw wife
stormed into the offices of The Independent, not a Murdoch paper, when the paper endorsed the
LDs and confronted the publisher, screaming in the middle of the newsroom. Murdoch would be
a big, big loser if Cameron loses. Another possibile outcome is that the Conservatives come up
just short and attempt their own deal with the DUP to cover the gap in seats. Shaun is on to this
potential, has been talking to Peter Robinson.
No matter what, keep your powder dry until the result is crystal clear. Wait.

America and Iran: Strikes, Sanctions and Scapegoats
For the pundits, there are only two questions about U.S.-Iran relations that are of any importance: (1) Will Israel
and/or the United States attack Iran? and (2) will the new sanctions have enough bite to persuade Iran to change
its nuclear policy? Despite all the printers ink spilled on these two issues, the answers are an easy no and no.
Neither the United States nor Israel will take the military option off the table, thereby giving the pundits (and the
crowd that is dying to repeat Iraq) latitude to keep the distant prospect of military action on the front pages,
where it has been for years. As a lede, it sells columns and newspapers, so it will not go away. But as analysis it
is either blinded by the momentary hype or else is simple wish fulfillment.
Uber-neocon John Bolton had it right. If any such attack were to occur, it would have been at the end of the Bush
administration when there was nothing left to lose. Bolton thought it was so inevitable that he predicted it
unequivocally in a Wall Street Journal column in 2008. Dick Cheney apparently agreed, judging from his
subsequent statements of regret. So it is fair to say that George W. Bush, after looking the potential
consequences, resisted the advice of his neocon advisers, his previously dominant vice president, and the
reported direct request from the government of Israel — and rejected a strike. What is the likelihood that Barack
Obama, with the same catastrophic scenario before him, will approve? Forget it.
Sanctions do not persuade dictatorial regimes to abandon projects that they think are central to their security
and survival or even their self-image. Just look at Saddam Hussein. The international sanctions imposed on Iraq
in the 1980s make the current Iran sanctions appear anemic in comparison. Every item that went in and out of
Iraq was subject to approval by a UN committee dominated by a vindictive United States. Yet, although Iraq had
abandoned its nuclear weapons program years earlier, Saddam could not bring himself to let his own people and
his enemies know that. Instead he was prepared to gamble that the United States would not attack him.
One of the reasons for this bad bet was that he and his cronies were doing so well under the sanctions that there
was no immediate necessity to come clean. They, after all, controlled the smuggling routes. And their henchmen
managed the thriving and enormously lucrative black market. As for concern with their own people, a rotund
Tariq Aziz, sitting with a fine Scotch and a Cuban cigar, informed a worried UN representative that it would be
good for the Iraqi people to lose some weight. An Iraqi friend of mine told me at the time that the sanctions had
made criminals of the entire Iraqi middle class, which had to resort to illegal behavior in order to survive. The
biggest – and most successful – of this new criminal class was the privileged group immediately around Saddam
Hussein.
Which brings us to Iran. The sanctions are more effective than many anticipated. They have built a web of
financial restrictions and limitations around the already weak Iranian economy that is certain to cause significant
problems for the leadership. Iran's critical energy sector is particularly vulnerable. It is in a pincer. Because of
cheap energy prices inside the country, artificially propped up by massive subsidies, energy demand is soaring.
This siphons off a lot of Iran's oil production, which would otherwise be sold on the world market for hard
currency.
At the same time, because Iran's oil fields are old and complex, they require modern technology to maintain
production. That technology – and the capital investment that can only be provided by the major international oil
companies – has been absent for many years. It was driven away partly by the sanctions, ironically assisted by
Iran's own short-sighted negotiating tactics that offered only the most meager profit margins to outside
investors. As a result, Iran's oil production is in decline at the same time that more and more of it is being soaked
up by domestic consumption. In a period of relatively low oil prices, this means that Iran's hard currency
earnings are drying up at an alarming rate.
This unenviable economic situation is compounded by what has to be described as perhaps the least competent
economic management team of any major country in the world. Ayatollah Khamene'i, the Supreme Leader,
seems totally preoccupied with bolstering his own shaky political legitimacy by pandering to the Revolutionary

Guards who surround and protect him. The result is corruption on a scale beyond anything the shah's regime
could have imagined.
President Ahmadinejad, also a creature of the Revolutionary Guards, is free to indulge his taste for outlandish
and irresponsible rhetoric. His words keep the international and domestic spotlight glued to him; but the effect
drives away prospective investors and facilitates the U.S. drive to enlist international support for sanctions
against Iran. An American Jewish leader once joked with me that he suspected Ahmadinejad was a Mossad
agent: no one, he observed, had been more helpful in promoting donations to Israel and Israeli causes. At the
same time, under his leadership Iran has inflation and unemployment that are both in double digits.
But to be fair, Ahmadinejad is the first politician in modern Iranian history willing to address the "third rail" of
Iranian politics — the immensely costly subsidies on food and energy. His initial efforts to reduce the amount of
subsidized gasoline that Iranians could use met with outbursts of indignation, including torching filling stations.
But these rules now seem to be grudgingly accepted and have eased slightly Iran's energy dilemma. He is now
addressing the low tax rates assessed against merchants. This has also resulted in outrage, including closing
the bazaars in Iran and other major cities. But his campaign seems to be making progress.
These are needed reforms that would be recommended by any responsible economic overseer, including the
International Monetary Fund. Ahmadinejad attempts to balance his daring assaults on the entrenched economic
interests by his belligerent rhetoric, always casting himself as the champion of the little guy. In that he resembles
his populist predecessors, from Juan Peron to Huey Long to Hugo Chavez. Ahmadinejad takes on America and
Israel the way Governor Long took on Standard Oil. But like other populists, Ahmadinejad is the prisoner of his
own eccentric view of the world and his loyalty to lieutenants who may or may not be worthy of his faith in them.
The key question about Iran today is not whether it will be attacked or collapse under sanctions. It is whether Iran
is capable under its present leadership to take a sober decision about how to deal with the outside world. The
Revolutionary Guards have established a dominant position in Iran's military, its economy, and its politics. Iran
increasingly comes to resemble the corporatist states of southern and eastern Europe in the 1920s and '30s that
we call fascist. Iran is conducting an interior battle with its own demons, from the millenarians on the far right
who choose to believe that Khamene'i is the personal representative of God on earth, to the pragmatic
conservatives who simply want a more responsible leadership, to the reformists of the Green movement whose
objective is to put the "republic" back into the Islamic Republic by giving the people a greater voice.
This is a yeasty and unpredictable mix. No one knows what is going to happen next.
And this is the reality that the Obama administration must deal with. The danger is not that the administration will
back the wrong horse in Iran. The real danger is that the Obama administration will be so preoccupied with
domestic American politics and its constant demand to look tough when dealing with Iran that it will
inadvertently rescue this cruel but hapless regime from its own ineptitude by providing a convenient scapegoat
for everything that goes wrong in Iran.

Re: Hague meeting
On your meeting on Friday, May 14, with new British Foreign Secretary William Hague you might explore a
number of issues below. (I've discussed with Shaun.)
Northern Ireland. Cameron has pledged to reduce public sector spending in NI. But the impact of public
sector spending there is not the same as in other parts of the UK because of 40 years of troubles.
Political stability depends upon economic stability. Removing funding specifically threatens community
policing, creating a vacuum that the Real IRA and other men of violence would rush into. Cutting the
public sector would make it difficult to increase private sector investment. Does the new government
understand the US interest in NI and appreciate the fragility of the situation?
Defense and Foreign Policy Cuts. The new government program is to slash the deficit, cutting deeply into
government programs. This really cannot be done without defense and foreign policy reductions. Seek
claficiation on exactly whether and where these cuts be made. Will they affect Afghanistan policy and
over what schedule? How will cuts in the foreign service affect British influence in other areas?
Trident and Nuclear Deterrent. The coalition agreement between the Conservative and Liberal Democrats
allows the LDs to abstain in parliamentary votes on four issues that will apparently let the Tories have
their way: marriage tax allowances; nuclear power; college tuition fees; and Trident and the nuclear
deterrent. During the campaign, the LDs ran on eliminating the Trident and erasing the UK nuclear
deterrent. How will this actually work in practice?
Political Changes. The new government, because the coalition is fundamentally at odds with itself, has
proposed to pass a parliamentary bill that establishes a five year term for a government and furthermore
establishes that a vote of no confidence can only be passed on a 55 percent vote. You might just seek
Hague's view on how this will work.

Inners arid Losers
Ey ROGER COHEN
NEW YORK — The Clintons threw a big Washington bash on June 30 for Hillary Clinton's longtime aide, Hume Abedin,
and what struck one of the many guests was the absence of anyone from President Obama's tight White House inner
circle.
Congressional heavyweights thronged the garden of the Clinton spread on Embassy Row, including House Speaker
Nancy Pelosi. The city's big powerbrokers and various State Department honchos were there for a party marking Abedin's
marriage to Congressman Anthony Weiner of New York. But White House insiders stayed away.
Well, as Bill Clinton told CNN recently, "I did everything I could to defeat President Obama and I wanted Hillary to win" —
old wounds do not heal overnight. Indeed, they may not heal at all. When my informant said something about the old
grievances not going away, the response from the hosts went something like this:
No, they don't and they never will. But, we're public servants and suckers for punishment, so we soldier on.
Speaking of soldiering on, Mrs. Clinton left for Europe the next day and while Americans celebrated July 4, she was in
Armenia trying to sort out the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute and.— equally thankless task — mediate between Armenia and
Turkey on their disagreement over what happened in 1915.
You've got to salute Hillary. She's got guts to go with that razor-sharp mind. It's a heck of a job being secretary of state
when the White House puts a tight collar around the big issues — Afghanistan, Iran, Israel-Palestine and Iraq — and
you're left with Nagorno-Karabakh, disputed Ottoman crimes of World War I and, if you're lucky, U.S. bases on Okinawa.
The situation might be slightly less troubling if the boys in the White House — and they are overwhelmingly boys — were
foreign-policy heavyweights. They're not. Indeed, I'm told Henry Kissinger refers to them as "the kids."
Chief among them, according to my colleague Helene Cooper, is Denis McDonough, the National Security Council's chief
of staff. Earlier this month, Cooper wrote: "Forget Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton or Defense Secretary Robert
M. Gates. When it comes to national security, Mr. Obama's inner circle is so tight it largely consists of Mr. McDonough, a
40-year-old from Minnesota who is unknown to most Americans."
I do know McDonough and I've spent a fair amount of time in Minnesota. He has many of the state's qualities: positive,
brisk, can-do, affable and efficient.
But am I reassured when! read that Obama's national-security inner circle is comprised of him? Nope. He was a great
guy to control the foreign-policy side of a campaign — as he did to perfection for Obama — but he's not a great guy to
think big about the world.
Thinking big and bold is required right now. The clock is ticking on momentous presidential decisions. Among them are an
Afghan extrication that will salvage a minimum of core U.S. security interests — which will require a bruising negotiation
with the Taliban — and what to do about Iran when it becomes apparent by the end of this year that the latest sanctions
have changed nothing. Obama's apparent carte blanche to Israel this month on Iran was disturbing.
Then there's Israel-Palestine, where Obama can't decide whether the cost of being an honest broker pressure on both
sides — is worth the domestic heat he takes for being critical of Israel, with the result that he's zigzagging to little effect.
After firing Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, Obama said he would tolerate debate but not division. My sense is his foreign-
policy house is divided — and the weaker for it. Gen. James Jones, his national security adviser, speaks fine French —

the French love that — but he's left most people unconvinced. Tom Donilon, Jones' deputy, dances around the vacuum
as best he can. Like McDonough, David Axelrod and Rehm Emanuel were brilliant campaign strategists, but should they
be foreign-policy strategists?
In Clinton, Obama has a Baker-class secretary of state. For how much longer is he going to delegate her to Nagorno-
Karabakh? The State Department, a repository of Other underused talent, cannot be the White House annex for non-
critical affairs.
Back in the 1860s, James Gordon Bennett, then the editor of the New York Herald, a forebear of the International Herald
Tribune, gave these instructions to an intrepid foreign correspondent named Henry Morton Stanley:
"Draw a thousand pounds now; and when you have gone through that, draw another thousand, and when that is spent,
draw another thousand, and when you have finished that, draw another thousand, and so on; but, FIND LIVINGSTONE."
He was referring to the lost African explorer, David Livingstone, whom Stanley eventually tracked down on Lake
Tanganyika, uttering the immortal words: "Doctor Livingstone, I presume?"
That sort of journalism's gone out of fashion. So we can all thank Rolling Stone for opening its pocketbook and telling
Michael Hastings to do whatever it took to find General McChrystal. In his brilliant piece, Hastings did that. He also found
something else: an Afghan policy as fragmented as the team Obama running it.
McChrystal's gone, but not the dysfunction. A blow-up, I presume? Watch this space.

In 20015 PM boasted of manipulating Oslo accords
By I Jul 15, 2010 4:03 PM
Netanyahu in 2001.
CREDIT: ::nl 1
Meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu last week, President Obama could not have been more effusive. "I believe Prime
Minister Netanyahu wants peace," Obama :3411 ill. "I believe he is ready to take risks for peace."
A newly revealed tape of Netanyahu in 2001, being interviewed while he thinks the cameras are off, shows him in a
radically different light. in it, Netanyahu dismisses American foreign policy as easy to maneuver, boasts of having derailed
the Oslo accords with political trickery, and suggests that the only way to deal with the Palestinians is to "beat them up,
not once but repeatedly, beat them up so it hurts so badly, until it's unbearable" (all translations are mine).
PI to Haaretz's Gideon Levy, the video should be "Banned for viewing by children so as not to corrupt them, and
distributed around the country and the world so that everyone will know who leads the government of Israel."
Netanyahu is speaking to a small group of terror victims in the West Bank settlement of Ofra two years after stepping
down as prime minister in 1999. He appears laid-back. After claiming that the only way to deal with the Palestinian
Authority was a large-scale attack, Netanyahu was asked by one of the participants whether or not the United States
would let such an attack come to fruition.
"I know what America is," Netanyahu replied. "America is'a thing you can move very easily, move it in the right direction.
They won't get in their way." He then called former president Bill Clinton "radically pro-Palestinian," and went on to belittle
the Oslo peace accords as vulnerable to manipulation. Since the accords state that Israel would be allowed to hang on to
pre-defined military zones in the West Bank, Netanyahu told his hosts that he could torpedo the accords by defining vast
swaths of land as just that.
"They asked me before the election if rd honor [the Oslo accords]," Netanyahu said. "I said I would, but ... I'm going to
interpret the accords in such a way that would allow me to put an end to this gallOping forward to the '67 borders. How did
we do it? Nobody said what defined military zones were. Defined military zones aresecurity zones; as far as I'm
concerned, the entire Jordan Valley is a defined military zone. Go argue."
Smiling, Netanyahu then recalled how he forced former U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to agree to let Israel
alone determine which parts of the West Bank were to be defined as military zones. "They didn't want to give me that
letter," Netanyahu said, "so I didn't give them the Hebron agreement [the agreement giving Hebron back to the
Palestinians]. I cut the cabinet meeting short and said, 'I'm not signing.' Only when the letter came, during that meeting, to
me and to Arafat, did I ratify the Hebron agreement. Why is this important? Because from that moment on, I de facto put
an end to the Oslo accords."
President Obama, and anyone else concerned about Israel's commitment to the peace process, may watch the tape
online here PI.

In 2003, several prominent Jewish philanthropists hired Republican pollster Frank Luntz to explain why American Jewish
college students were not more vigorously rebutting campus criticism of Israel. In response, he unwittingly produced the
most damning indictment of the organized American Jewish community that I have ever seen.
The philanthropists wanted to know what Jewish students thought about Israel. Luntz found that they mostly didn't. "Six
times we have brought Jewish youth together as a group to talk about their Jewishness and connection to Israel," he
reported. "Six times the topic of Israel did not come up until it was prompted. Six times these Jewish youth used the word
'they' rather than'us` to describe the situation."
That Luntz encountered indifference was not surprising. In recent years, several studies have revealed, in the words of
Steven Cohen of Hebrew Union College and An Kelman of the University of California at Davis, that "non-Orthodox
younger Jews, on the whole, feel much less attached to Israel than their elders," with many professing "a near-total
absence of positive feelings." In 2008, the student senate at Brandeis, the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored university
in America, rejected a resolution commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the Jewish state.
Luntz's task was to figure out what had gone wrong. When he probed the students' views of Israel, he hit up against some
firm beliefs. First, "they reserve the right to question the Israeli position." These young Jews, Luntz explained, "resist
anything they see as 'group think." They want an "open and frank" discussion of Israel and its flaws. Second, "young
Jews desperately want peace." When Luntz showed them a series of ads, one of the most popular was entitled "Proof that
Israel Wants Peace," and listed offers by various Israeli governments to withdraw from conquered land. Third, "some
empathize with the plight of the Palestinians." When Luntz displayed ads depicting Palestinians as violent and hateful,
several focus group participants criticized them as stereotypical and unfair, citing their own Muslim friends.
Most of the students, in other words, were liberals, broadly defined. They had imbibed some of the defining values of
American Jewish political culture: a belief in open debate, a skepticism about military force, a commitment to human
rights. And in their innocence, they did not realize that they were supposed to shed those values when it came to Israel.
The only kind of Zionism they found attractive was a Zionism that recognized Palestinians as deserving of dignity and
capable of peace, and they were quite willing to condemn an Israeli government that did not share those beliefs. Luntz did
not grasp the irony. The only kind of Zionism they found attractive was the kind that the American Jewish establishment
has been working against for most of their lives.
Among American Jews today, there are a great many Zionists, especially in the Orthodox world, people deeply devoted to
the State of Israel. And there are a great many liberals, especially in the secular Jewish world, people deeply devoted to
human rights for all people, Palestinians included. But the two groups are increasingly distinct. Particularly in the younger
generations, fewer and fewer American Jewish liberals are Zionists; fewer and fewer American Jewish Zionists are liberal.
One reason is that the leading institutions of American Jewry have refused to foster—indeed, have actively opposed—a
Zionism that challenges Israel's behavior in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and toward its own Arab citizens. For several

decades, the Jewish establishment has asked American Jews to check their liberalism at Zionism's door, and now, to their
horror, they are finding that many young Jews have checked their Zionism instead.
Morally, American Zionism is in a downward spiral. If the leaders of groups like AIPAC and the Conference of Presidents
of Major American Jewish Organizations do not change course, they will wake up one day to find a younger, Orthodox-
dominated, Zionist leadership whose naked hostility to Arabs and Palestinians scares even them, and a mass of secular
American Jews who range from apathetic to appalled. Saving liberal Zionism in the United States—so that American Jews
can help save liberal Zionism in Israel—is the great American Jewish challenge of our age. And it starts where Luntz's
students wanted it to start: by talking frankly about Israel's current government, by no longer averting our eyes.
Since the 1990s, journalists and scholars have been describing a bifurcation in Israeli society. In the words of Hebrew
University political scientist Yaron Ezrahi, "After decades of what came to be called a national consensus, the Zionist
narrative of liberation [has] dissolved into openly contesting versions." One version, "founded on a long memory of
persecution, genocide, and a bitter struggle for survival, is pessimistic, distrustful of non-Jews, and believing only in
Jewish power and solidarity." Another, "nourished by secularized Versions of messianism as well as the Enlightenment
idea of progress," articulates "a deep sense of the limits of military force, and a commitment to liberal-democratic values."
Every country manifests some kind of ideological divide. But in contemporary Israel, the gulf is among the widest on earth.
As Ezrahi and others have noted, this latter, liberal-democratic Zionism has grown alongside a new individualism,
particularly among secular Israelis, a greater demand for free expression, and a greater skepticism of coercive authority.
You can see this spirit in "new historians" like Tom Segev who have fearlessly excavated the darker corners of the Zionist
past and in jurists like former Supreme Court President Aharon Barak who have overturned Knesset laws that violate the
human rights guarantees in Israel's "Basic Laws." You can also see it in former Prime Minister Ehud Barak's apparent
willingness to relinquish much of the West Bank in 2000 and early 2001.
But in Israel today, this humane, universalistic Zionism does not wield power. To the contrary, it is gasping for air. To
understand how deeply antithetical its values are to those of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, it's worth
considering the case of Effi Eitam. Eitam, a charismatic ex–cabinet minister and war hero, has proposed ethnically
cleansing Palestinians from the West Bank. "We'll have to expel the overwhelming majority of West Bank Arabs from here
and remove Israeli Arabs from [the] political system," he declared in 2006. In 2008, Eitam merged his small Ahi Party into
Netanyahu's Likud. And for the 2009-2010 academic year, he is Netanyahu's special emissary for overseas "campus
engagement." In that capacity, he visited a dozen American high schools and colleges last fall on the Israeli government's
behalf. The group that organized his tour was called "Caravan for Democracy."
Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman once shared Eitam's views. In his youth, he briefly joined Meir Kahane's now
banned Kach Party, which also advocated the expulsion of Arabs from Israeli soil. Now Lieberman's position might be
called "pre-expulsion." He wants to revoke the citizenship of Israeli Arabs who won't swear a loyalty oath to the Jewish
state. He tried to prevent two Arab parties that opposed Israel's 2008-2009 Gaza war from running candidates for the
Knesset. He said Arab Knesset members who met with representatives of Hamas should be executed. He wants to jail
Arabs who publicly mourn on Israeli Independence Day, and he hopes to permanently deny citizenship to Arabs from
other countries who marry Arab citizens of Israel.
You don't have to be paranoid to see the connection between Lieberman's current views and his former ones. The more
you strip Israeli Arabs of legal protection, and the more you accuse them of treason, the more thinkable a policy of
expulsion becomes. Lieberman's American defenders often note that in theory he supports a Palestinian state. What they
usually fail to mention is that for him, a two-state solution means redrawing Israel's border so that a large chunk of Israeli
Arabs find themselves exiled to another country, without their consent.
Lieberman served as chief of staff during Netanyahu's first term as prime minister. And when it comes to the West Bank,
Netanyahu's own record is in its way even more extreme than his protégé's. In his 1993 book, A Place among the
Nations, Netanyahu not only rejects the idea of a Palestinian state, he denies that there is such a thing as a Palestinian. In
fact, he repeatedly equates the Palestinian bid for statehood with Nazism. An Israel that withdraws from the West Bank,
he has declared, would be a "ghetto-state" with "Auschwitz borders." And the effort "to gouge Judea and Samaria [the
West Bank] out of Israel" resembles Hitler's bid to wrench the German-speaking "Sudeten district" from Czechoslovakia in
1938. It is unfair, Netanyahu insists, to ask Israel to concede more territory since it has already made vast, gut-wrenching
concessions. What kind of concessions? It has abandoned its claim to Jordan, which by rights should be part of the
Jewish state.
On the left of Netanyahu's coalition sits Ehud Barak's emasculated Labor Party, but whatever moderating potential it may
have is counterbalanced by what is, in some ways, the most illiberal coalition partner of all, Shas, the ultra-Orthodox party
representing Jews of North African and Middle Eastern descent. At one point, Shas—like some of its Ashkenazi ultra-
Orthodox counterparts—was open to dismantling settlements. In recent years, however, ultra-Orthodox Israelis, anxious
to find housing for their large families, have increasingly moved to the West Bank, where thanks to government subsidies
it is far cheaper to live. Not coincidentally, their political parties have swung hard against territorial compromise. And they
have done so with a virulence that reflects ultra-Orthodox Judaism's profound hostility to liberal values. Rabbi Ovadia
Yosef, Shas's immensely powerful spiritual leader, has called Arabs "vipers," "snakes," and "ants." In 2005, after Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon proposed dismantling settlements in the Gaza Strip, Yosef urged that "God strike him down." The
official Shas newspaper recently called President Obama "an Islamic extremist."
Hebrew University Professor Ze'ev Sternhell is an expert on fascism and a winner of the prestigious Israel Prize.
Commenting on Lieberman and the leaders of Shas in a recent Op-Ed in Haaretz, he wrote, "The last time politicians

holding views similar to theirs were in power in post–World War II Western Europe was in Franco's Spain." With their
blessing, "a crude and multifaceted campaign is being waged against the foundations of the democratic and liberal order."
Sternhell should know. In September 2008, he was injured when a settler set off a pipe bomb at his house.
Israeli governments come and go, but the Netanyahu coalition is the product of frightening, long-term trends in Israeli
society: an ultra-Orthodox population that is increasing dramatically, a settler movement that is growing more radical and
more entrenched in the Israeli bureaucracy and army, and a Russian immigrant community that is particularly prone to
anti-Arab racism. In 2009, a poll by the Israel Democracy Institute found that 53 percent of Jewish Israelis (and 77 percent
of recent immigrants from the former USSR) support encouraging Arabs to leave the country. Attitudes are worst among
Israel's young. When Israeli high schools held mock elections last year, Lieberman won. This March, a poll found that 56
percent of Jewish Israeli high school students—and more than 80 percent of religious Jewish high school students—
would deny Israeli Arabs the right to be elected to the Knesset. An education ministry official called the survey "a huge
warning signal in light of the strengthening trends of extremist views among the youth."
You might think that such trends, and the sympathy for them expressed by some in Israel's government, would occasion
substantial public concern—even outrage—among the leaders of organized American Jewry. You would be wrong. In
Israel itself, voices from the left, and even center, warn in increasingly urgent tones about threats to Israeli democracy.
(Former Prime Ministers Ehud Olmert and Ehud Barak have both said that Israel risks becoming an "apartheid state" if it
continues to hold the West Bank. This April, when settlers forced a large Israeli bookstore to stop selling a book critical of
the occupation, Shulamit Aloni, former head of the dovish Meretz Party, declared that "Israel has not been democratic for
some time now.") But in the United States, groups like AIPAC and the Presidents' Conference patrol public discourse,
scolding people who contradict their vision of Israel as a state in which all leaders cherish democracy and yearn
for peace.
The result is a terrible irony. In theory, mainstream American Jewish organizations still hew to a liberal vision of Zionism.
On its website, AIPAC celebrates Israel's commitment to "free speech and minority rights." The Conference of Presidents
declares that "Israel and the United States share political, moral and intellectual values including democracy, freedom,
security and peace." These groups would never say, as do some in Netanyahu's coalition, that Israeli Arabs don't deserve
full citizenship and West Bank Palestinians don't deserve human rights. But in practice, by defending virtually anything
any Israeli government does, they make themselves intellectual bodyguards for Israeli leaders who threaten the very
liberal values they profess to admire.
After Israel's elections last February, for instance, Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice-chairman of the Presidents'
Conference, explained that Avigdor Lieberman's agenda was "far more moderate than the media has presented it."
Insisting that Lieberman bears no general animus toward Israeli Arabs, Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-
Defamation League, told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that "He's not saying expel them. He's not saying punish them."
(Permanently denying citizenship to their Arab spouses or jailing them if they publicly mourn on Israeli Independence Day
evidently does not qualify as punishment.) The ADL has criticized anti-Arab bigotry in the past, and the American Jewish
Committee, to its credit, warned that Lieberman's proposed loyalty oath would "chill Israel's democratic political debate."
But the Forward summed up the overall response of America's communal Jewish leadership in its headline "Jewish
Leaders Largely Silent on Lieberman's Role in Government."
Not only does the organized American Jewish community mostly avoid public criticism of the Israeli government, it tries to
prevent others from leveling such criticism as well. In recent years, American Jewish organizations have waged a
campaign to discredit the world's most respected international human rights groups. In 2006, Foxman called an Amnesty
International report on Israeli killing of Lebanese civilians "bigoted, biased, and borderline anti-Semitic." The Conference
of Presidents has announced that "biased NGOs include Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Christian Aid, [and]
Save the Children." Last summer, an AIPAC spokesman declared that Human Rights Watch "has repeatedly
demonstrated its anti-Israel bias." When the Obama administration awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Mary
Robinson, former UN high commissioner for human rights, the ADL and AIPAC both protested, citing the fact that she had
presided over the 2001 World Conference Against Racism in Durban, South Africa. (Early drafts of the conference report
implicitly accused Israel of racism. Robinson helped expunge that defamatory charge, angering Syria and Iran.)
Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are not infallible. But when groups like AIPAC and the Presidents'
Conference avoid virtually all public criticism of Israeli actions—directing their outrage solely at Israel's neighbors—they
leave themselves in a poor position to charge bias. Moreover, while American Jewish groups claim that they are simply
defending Israel from its foes, they are actually taking sides in a struggle within Israel between radically different Zionist
visions. At the very moment the Anti-Defamation League claimed that Robinson harbored an "animus toward Israel," an
alliance of seven Israeli human rights groups publicly congratulated her on her award. Many of those groups, like
B'Tselem, which monitors Israeli actions in the Occupied Territories, and the Israeli branch of Physicians for Human
Rights, have been at least as critical of Israel's actions in Lebanon, Gaza, and the West Bank as have Amnesty
International and Human Rights Watch.
All of which raises an uncomfortable question. If American Jewish groups claim that Israel's overseas human rights critics
are motivated by anti- Israeli, if not anti-Semitic, bias, what does that say about Israel's domestic human rights critics?
The implication is clear: they must be guilty of self-hatred, if not treason. American Jewish leaders don't generally say
that, of course, but their allies in the Netanyahu government do. Last summer, Israel's vice prime minister, Moshe Ya'alon,
called the anti-occupation group Peace Now a "virus." This January, a right-wing group called Im Tirtzu accused Israeli
human rights organizations of having fed information to the Goldstone Commission that investigated Israel's Gaza war. A

Knesset member from Netanyahu's Likud promptly charged Naomi Chazan, head of the New Israel Fund, which supports
some of those human rights groups, with treason, and a member of Lieberman's party launched an investigation aimed at
curbing foreign funding of Israeli NG0s.
To their credit, Foxman and other American Jewish leaders opposed the move, which might have impaired their own
work. But they are reaping what they sowed. If you suggest that mainstream human rights criticism of Israel's government
is motivated by animus toward the state, or toward Jews in general, you give aid and comfort to those in Israel who make
the same charges against the human rights critics in their midst.
In the American Jewish establishment today, the language of liberal Zionism—with its idioms of human rights, equal
citizenship, and territorial compromise—has been drained of meaning. It remains the lingua franca in part for generational
reasons, because many older American Zionists still see themselves as liberals of a sort. They vote Democratic; they are
unmoved by biblical claims to the West Bank; they see average Palestinians as decent people betrayed by bad leaders;
and they are secular. They don't want Jewish organizations to criticize Israel from the left, but neither do they want them
to be agents of the Israeli right.
These American Zionists are largely the product of a particular era. Many were shaped by the terrifying days leading up to
the Six-Day War, when it appeared that Israel might be overrun, and by the bitter aftermath of the Yom Kippur War, when
much of the world seemed to turn against the Jewish state. In that crucible, Israel became their Jewish identity, often in
conjunction with the Holocaust, which the 1967 and 1973 wars helped make central to American Jewish life. These Jews
embraced Zionism before the settler movement became a major force in Israeli politics, before the 1982 Lebanon war,
before the first intifada. They fell in love with an Israel that was more secular, less divided, and less shaped by the culture,
politics, and theology of occupation. And by downplaying the significance of Avigdor Lieberman, the settlers, and Shas,
American Jewish groups allow these older Zionists to continue to identify with that more internally cohesive, more
innocent Israel of their youth, an Israel that now only exists in their memories.
But these secular Zionists aren't reproducing themselves. Their children have no memory of Arab armies massed on
Israel's border and of Israel surviving in part thanks to urgent military assistance from the United States. Instead, they
have grown up viewing Israel as a regional hegemon and an occupying power. As a result, they are more conscious than
their parents of the degree to which Israeli behavior violates liberal ideals, and less willing to grant Israel an exemption
because its survival seems in peril. Because they have inherited their parents' liberalism, they cannot embrace their
uncritical Zionism. Because their liberalism is real, they can see that the liberalism of the American Jewish establishment
is fake.
To sustain their uncritical brand of Zionism, therefore, America's Jewish organizations will need to look elsewhere to
replenish their ranks. They will need to find young American. Jews who have come of age during the West Bank
occupation but are not troubled by it. And those young American Jews will come disproportionately from the
Orthodox world.
Because they marry earlier, intermarry less, and have more children, Orthodox Jews are growing rapidly as a share of the
American Jewish population. According to a 2006 American Jewish Committee (AJC) survey, while Orthodox Jews make
up only 12 percent of American Jewry over the age of sixty, they constitute 34 percent between the ages of eighteen and
twenty-four. For America's Zionist organizations, these Orthodox youngsters are a potential bonanza. In their yeshivas
they learn devotion to Israel from an early age; they generally spend a year of religious study there after high school, and
often know friends or relatives who have immigrated to Israel. The same AJC study found that while only 16 percent of
non-Orthodox adult Jews under the age of forty feel "very close to Israel," among the Orthodox the figure is 79 percent. As
secular Jews drift away from America's Zionist institutions, their Orthodox counterparts will likely step into the breach. The
Orthodox "are still interested in parochial Jewish concerns," explains Samuel Heilman, a sociologist at the City University
of New York. "They are among the last ones who stayed in the Jewish house, so they now control the lights."
But it is this very parochialism—a deep commitment to Jewish concerns, which often outweighs more universal ones—
that gives Orthodox Jewish Zionism a distinctly illiberal cast. The 2006 AJC poll found that while 60 percent of non-
Orthodox American Jews under the age of forty support a Palestinian state, that figure drops to 25 percent among the
Orthodox. In 2009, when Brandeis University's Theodore Sasson asked American Jewish focus groups about Israel, he
found Orthodox participants much less supportive of dismantling settlements as part of a peace deal. Even more tellingly,
Reform, Conservative, and unaffiliated Jews tended to believe that average Palestinians wanted peace, but had been ill-
served by their leaders. Orthodox Jews, by contrast, were more likely to see the Palestinian people as the enemy, and to
deny that ordinary Palestinians shared any common interests or values with ordinary Israelis or Jews.
Orthodox Judaism has great virtues, including a communal warmth and a commitment to Jewish learning unmatched in
the American Jewish world. (I'm biased, since my family attends an Orthodox synagogue.) But if current trends continue,
the growing influence of Orthodox Jews in America's Jewish communal institutions will erode even the liberal-democratic
veneer that today covers American Zionism. In 2002, America's major Jewish organizations sponsored a large Israel
solidarity rally on the Washington Mall. Up and down the east coast, yeshivas shut down for the day, swelling the
estimated Orthodox share of the crowd to close to 70 percent. When the then Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul
Wolfowitz told the rally that "innocent Palestinians are suffering and dying as well," he was booed.
America's Jewish leaders should think hard about that rally. Unless they change course, it portends the future: an
American Zionist movement that does not even feign concern for Palestinian dignity and a broader American Jewish
population that does not even feign concern for Israel. My own children, given their upbringing, could as easily end up
among the booers as among Luntz's focus group. Either prospect fills me with dread.

In 2004, in an effort to prevent weapons smuggling from Egypt, Israeli tanks and bulldozers demolished hundreds of
houses in the Rafah refugee camp in the southern Gaza Strip. Watching television, a veteran Israeli commentator and
politician named Tommy Lapid saw an elderly Palestinian woman crouched on all fours looking for her medicines amid the
ruins of her home. He said she reminded him of his grandmother.
In that moment, Lapid captured the spirit that is suffocating within organized American Jewish life. To begin with, he
watched. In my experience, there is an epidemic of not watching among American Zionists today. A Red Cross study on
malnutrition in the Gaza Strip, a bill in the Knesset to allow Jewish neighborhoods to bar entry to Israeli Arabs, an Israeli
human rights report on settlers burning Palestinian olive groves, three more Palestinian teenagers shot—it's unpleasant.
Rationalizing and minimizing Palestinian suffering has become a kind of game. In a more recent report on how to foster
Zionism among America's young, Luntz urges American Jewish groups to use the word "Arabs, not Palestinians," since
"the term `Palestinians' evokes images of refugee camps, victims and oppression," while "Arab' says wealth, oil
and Islam."
Of course, Israel—like the United States—must sometimes take morally difficult actions in its own defense. But they are
morally difficult only if you allow yourself some human connection to the other side. Otherwise, security justifies
everything. The heads of AIPAC and the Presidents' Conference should ask themselves what Israel's leaders would have
to do or say to make them scream "no." After all, Lieberman is foreign minister; Effi Eitam is touring American universities;
settlements are growing at triple the rate of the Israeli population; half of Israeli Jewish high school students want Arabs
barred from the Knesset. If the line has not yet been crossed, where is the line?
What infuriated critics about Lapid's comment was that his grandmother died at Auschwitz. How dare he defile the
memory of the Holocaust? Of course, the Holocaust is immeasurably worse than anything Israel has done or ever will do.
•
But at least Lapid used Jewish suffering to connect to the suffering of others. In the world of AIPAC, the Holocaust
analogies never stop, and their message is always the same: Jews are licensed by their victimhood to worry only about
themselves. Many of Israel's founders believed that with statehood, Jews would rightly be judged on the way they treated
the non-Jews living under their dominion. "For the first time we shall be the majority living with a minority," Knesset
member Pinchas Lavon declared in 1948, "and we shall be called upon to provide an example and prove how Jews live
with a minority."
But the message of the American Jewish establishment and its allies in the Netanyahu government is exactly the
opposite: since Jews are history's permanent victims, always on the knife-edge of extinction, moral responsibility is a
luxury Israel does not have. Its only responsibility is to survive. As former Knesset speaker Avraham Burg writes in his
remarkable 2008 book, The Holocaust Is Over; We Must Rise From Its Ashes, "Victimhood sets you free."
This obsession with victimhood lies at the heart of why Zionism is dying among America's secular Jewish young. It simply
bears no relationship to their lived experience, or what they have seen of Israel's. Yes, Israel faces threats from Hezbollah
and Hamas. Yes, Israelis understandably worry about a nuclear Iran. But the dilemmas you face when you possess
dozens or hundreds of nuclear weapons, and your adversary, however despicable, may acquire one, are not the
dilemmas of the Warsaw Ghetto. The year 2010 is not, as Benjamin Netanyahu has claimed, 1938. The drama of Jewish
victimhood—a drama that feels natural to many Jews who lived through 1938, 1948, or even 1967—strikes most of
today's young American Jews as farce.
But there is a different Zionist calling, which has never been more desperately relevant. It has its roots in Israel's
Independence Proclamation, which promised that the Jewish state "will be based on the precepts of liberty, justice and
peace taught by the Hebrew prophets," and in the December 1948 letter from Albert Einstein, Hannah Arendt, and others
to The New York Times, protesting right-wing Zionist leader Menachem Begin's visit to the United States after his party's
militias massacred Arab civilians in the village of Deir Yassin. It is a call to recognize that in a world in which Jewish
fortunes have radically changed, the best way to memorialize the history of Jewish suffering is through the ethical use of
Jewish power.
For several months now, a group of Israeli students has been traveling every Friday to the East Jerusalem neighborhood
of Sheikh Jarrah, where a Palestinian family named the Ghawis lives on the street outside their home of fifty-three years,
from which they were evicted to make room for Jewish settlers. Although repeatedly arrested for protesting without a
permit, and called traitors and self-haters by the Israeli right, the students keep coming, their numbers now swelling into
the thousands. What if American Jewish organizations brought these young people to speak at Hillel? What if this was the
face of Zionism shown to America's Jewish young? What if the students in Luntz's focus group had been told that their
generation faces a challenge as momentous as any in Jewish history: to save liberal democracy in the only Jewish state
on earth?
"Too many years I lived in the warm embrace of institutionalized elusiveness and was a part of it," writes Avraham Burg. "I
was very comfortable there." I know; I was comfortable there too. But comfortable Zionism has become a moral
abdication. Let's hope that Luntz's students, in solidarity with their counterparts at Sheikh Jarrah, can foster an
uncomfortable Zionism, a Zionism angry at what Israel risks becoming, and in love with what it still could be. Let's hope
they care enough to try.

You may have been alerted to this incident: the barring of Noam Chomsky from Israel. His political views may be
ridiculous or objectionable, though he is the greatest linguistic scholar in the world, but barring him for his political opinions
has created a needless PR disaster, not least for the US, as he is, after all, a US citizen, and a very prominent one
internationally. It is unfortunate on every level. And the US should not be a passive onlooker. He is a US citizen barred for
his political views, after all. This story is splashed across the European press this morning. Not what anyone needs, yes,
yes, like a hole in the head, and bone stupid, but the US effort on his behalf to gain entry should be part of the story. This
incident can be profitable if Israel understands it should not be doing this to US or European critics in the future. This is a
downward slope, bad news for everyone involved. S

Chomsky Barred From West Bank by Israel
By ROBERT MACKEY
Noam Chomsky, an American linguist and political thinker who has been critical of Israel, was denied entry into the West
Bank on Sunday by Israeli immigration officials when he tried to cross into the Palestinian territory from Jordan to deliver a
lecture.
Amira Hass of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported:
No reason was initially given for the decision, but the Interior Ministry later said immigration officials at the Allenby Bridge
border crossing from Jordan had misunderstood Chomsky's intentions thinking initially he was also due to visit Israel.
Chomsky, who is on a speaking tour in the region, was scheduled to speak at Bir Zeit University in the West Bank on
Monday.
A spokeswoman for Israel's interior ministry also told Reuters that there had been a misunderstanding and "officials were
trying to get clearance from the Israeli military, which controls access to the West Bank to allow Chomsky to enter."
In a television interview from Amman, Jordan, after he was rebuffed, Mr. Chomsky told Al Jazeera English, "the facts were
completely clear to everyone; there was no basis for a misunderstanding." He explained that he was interrogated for
several hours before being told that he would not be allowed to cross into the occupied Palestinian territory. The 81-year-
old scholar added:
I can only say what was conveyed to me in the discussion with the official who was carrying out the interrogation — he
was receiving instructions from the [Israeli] ministry of interior and relaying them. There were two basic points. One was
that the government of Israel does not like the kinds of things I say — which puts them into the category of I suppose
every other government in the world. The second was that they seemed upset about the fact that I was just taking an
invitation from Bir Zeit and I had no plans to go on to speak in Israeli universities, as I have done many times in the past
but not this time.
Mr. Chomsky had been invited to speak about American foreign and domestic policy by the philosophy department at the
Palestinian university in Ramallah.
The renowned linguist was outspoken in his opposition to the Israeli offensive in Gaza, which ended in January 2009 and
has criticized Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory many times.
In an interview with Deborah Solomon of The New York Times Magazine in 2003, Mr. Chomsky said, "I objected to the
founding of Israel as a Jewish state. I don't think a Jewish or Christian or Islamic state is a proper concept. I would object
to the United States as a Christian state." When Ms. Solomon pressed Mr. Chomsky on his opposition to Israel, saying,
"Your father was a respected Hebraic scholar, and sometimes you sound like a self-hating Jew," he replied:
It is a shame that critics of Israeli policies are seen as either anti-Semites or self-hating Jews. It's grotesque. If an Italian
criticized Italian policies, would he be seen as a self-hating Italian?

The political genius of supply-side economics

. ,zzq
1h. H)t!..re LH. oclic■/ was intensely debated in the FT last week. In this Exchange, I want to examine what is going on
in '.he ..tS and, in particular, what is going on inside the Republican party. This matters for the US and, because the US
remains the world's most important economy, it also matters greatly for the world.
My reading of contemporary Republican thinking is that there is no chance of any attempt to arrest adverse long-term
fiscal trends should they return to power. Moreover, since the Republicans have no interest in doing anything sensible, the
Democrats will gain nothing from trying to do much either. That is the lesson Democrats have to draw from the Clinton
era's successful frugality, which merely gave George W. Bush the opportunity to make massive (irresponsible and
unsustainable) tax cuts. In practice, then, nothing will be done.
Indeed, nothing may be done even if a genuine fiscal crisis were to emerge. According to my friend, 5rpc*. Uartiett, a
highly informed, if jaundiced, observer, some "conservatives" (in truth, extreme radicals) think a federal default would be
an effective way to bring public spending they detest under control. It should be noted, in passing, that a federal default
would surely create the biggest financial crisis in world economic history.
To understand modern Republican thinking on fiscal policy, we need to go back to perhaps the most politically brilliant
(albeit economically unconvincing) idea in the history of fiscal policy: "supply-side economics". Supply-side economics
liberated conservatives from any need to insist on fiscal rectitude and balanced budgets. Supply-side economics said that
one could cut taxes and balance budgets, because incentive effects would generate new activity and so higher revenue.
The political genius of this idea is evident. Supply-side economics transformed Republicans from a minority party into a
majority party. It allowed them to promise lower taxes, lower deficits and, in effect, unchanged spending. Why should
people not like this combination? Who does not like a free lunch?
How did supply-side economics bring these benefits? First, it allowed conservatives to ignore deficits. They could argue
that, whatever the impact of the tax cuts in the short run, they would bring the budget back into balance, in the longer run.
Second, the theory gave an economic justification — the argument from incentives - for lowering taxes on politically
important supporters. Finally, if deficits did not, in fact, disappear, conservatives could fall back on the "starve the beast"
theory: deficits would create a fiscal crisis that would force the government to cut spending and even destroy the hated
welfare state.
In this way, the Republicans were transformed from a balanced-budget party to a tax-cutting party. This innovative stance
proved highly politically effective, consistently putting the Democrats at a political disadvantage. It also made the
Republicans de facto Keynesians in a de facto Keynesian nation. Whatever the rhetoric, I have long considered the US
the advanced world's most Keynesian nation — the one in which government (including the Federal Reserve) is most
expected to generate healthy demand at all times, largely because jobs are, in the US, the only safety net for those of
working age.
True, the theory that cuts would pay for themselves has proved altogether wrong. That this might well be the case was
evident: cutting tax rates from, say, 30 per cent to zero would unambiguously reduce revenue to zero. This is not to argue
there were no incentive effects. But they were not large enough to offset the fiscal impact of the cuts (see, on this,
Wikioedial and a nice chart from Paul Krugniarl
Indeed, Greg Mankiw, no less, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under George W. Bush, has responded to
the view that broad-based tax cuts would pay for themselves, as follows: "I did not find such a claim credible, based on
the available evidence. I never have, and I still don't." Indeed, he has referred to those who believe this as "charlatans and
cranks". Those are his words, not mine, though I agree. They apply, in force, to contemporary Republicans, alas,

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770731 Date: 08/31/2015
Since the fiscal theory of supply-side economics did not work, the tax-cutting eras of Ronald Reagan and George H. Bush
and again of George W. Bush saw very substantial rises in ratios of federal debt to gross domestic product. Under
Reagan and the first Bush, the ratio of public debt to GDP went from 33 per cent to 64 per cent. It fell to 57 per cent under
Bill Clinton. It then rose to 69 per cent gilder the second (
.
..73e
.proe Bush. Equally, tax cuts in the era of George W. Bush,
wars and the economic crisis account for almost all the dire fiscal outlook for the next ten years (see the Center on Budget
and Policy Priorities).
Today's extremely high deficits are also an inheritance from Bush-era tax-and-spending policies and the financial crisis,
also, of course, inherited by the present administration. Thus, according to the international Monetary Fund the impact of
discretionary stimulus on the US fiscal deficit amounts to a cumulative total of 4.7 per cent of GDP in 2009 and 2010,
while the cumuiative deficit over these years is forecast at 23.5 cer cent of GDP. In any case, the stimulus was certainly
too small, not too large.
The evidence shows, then, that contemporary conservatives (unlike those of old) simply do not think deficits matter, as
former vice-president Richard Cheney is recorted to have tolo forme,. treasury secretary Paul O'Neill. But this is not
because the supply-side theory of self-financing tax cuts, on which Reagan era tax cuts were justified, has worked, but
despite the fact it has not. The faith has outlived its economic (though not its political) rationale.
So, when Republicans assail the deficits under President Ot.)ama, are they to be taken seriously? Yes and no. Yes, they
are politically interested in blaming Mr Obama for deficits, since all is viewed fair in love and partisan politics. And yes,
they are, indeed, rhetorically opposed to deficits created by extra spending (although that did not prevent them from
enacting the unfunded prescription drug benefit, under President Bush). But no, it is not deficits themselves that worry
Republicans, but rather how they are caused: deficits caused by tax cuts are fine; but spending increases brought in by
Democrats are diabolical, unless on the military.
Indeed, this is precisely what John Ky:Lo
...rizonal. a_senior Republican senalcr, has just said:
"[Ylou should never raise taxes in order to cut taxes. Surely Congress has the authority, and it would be
right to — if we decide we want to cut taxes to spur the economy, not to have to raise taxes in order to
offset those costs. You do need to offset the cost of increased spending, and that's what Republicans
object to. But you should never have to offset the cost of a deliberate decision to reduce tax rates on
Americans"
What conclusions should outsiders draw about the likely future of US fiscal policy? .
First, if Republicans win the mid-terms in November, as seems likely, they are surely going to come up with huge tax cut
proposals (probably well beyond extending the already unaffordable Bush-era tax cuts).
Second, the White House will probably veto these cuts, making itself even more Politically unpopular.
Third, some additional fiscal stimulus is, in fact, what the US needs, in the short term, even though across-the-board tax
cuts are an extremely inefficient way of providing it.
Fourth, the Republican proposals would not, alas, be short term, but dangerously long term, in their impact.
Finally, with one party indifferent to deficits, provided they are brought about by tax cuts, and the other party relatively
fiscally responsible (well, everything is relative, after all), but opposed to spending cuts on core programmes, US fiscal
policy is paralysed. I may think the policies of the la L::
.._:agvernscei:jt dangerously austere, but at least it can act.
This is extraordinarily dangerous. The danger does not arise from the fiscal deficits of today, but the attitudes to fiscal
policy, over the long run, of one of the two main parties. Those radical conservatives (a small minority, I hope) who want
to destroy the credit of the US federal government may succeed. If so, that would be the end of the US era of global
dominance. The destruction of fiscal credibility could be the outcome of the policies of the party that considers itself the
most patriotic.
In sum, a great deal of trouble lies ahead, for the US and the world.

Subject: H: Several observations on the Israeli raid. Sid
First observation: Bibi's Entebbe in reverse. The father, Benzion Netanyahu, 100 years old, secretary to Jabotinsky, and
denounced as too radical by Begin, adored his son Yoni, heroically killed at Entebbe. Benyamin has never measured up.
Benzion has constantly criticized him in public for his deviations from the doctrine of Greater Israel. Bibi desperately seeks
his father's approbation and can never equal his dead brother. See Benzion's most recent scathing undermining of his son
Bibi and Bibi's tearful tribute to his brother just last month. The raid on the ship to Gaza resembles the raid on Entebbe,
except that there are no hostages, no guns, it's not in Africa, and it's a fiasco; otherwise, it's Entebbe. (Then, there's Ehud
Barak reliving his youth as a raider killing Palestinians in Lebanon, a feat memorialized in Spielberg's film, Munich.
Ultimately, it didn't work out well that time either. The film captures the moral quandaries, which appear to have escaped
the participants.)
Further observation: The international press will inquire whether the Obama administration gave a wink or nod as the
Bush administration did for the Lebanon and Gaza incursions. Be prepared.
Further: Of course, the consequences for US foreign policy and national security are negative across the board: from the
analogy of the North Korean ship sinking and the Chinese posture to support for Iranian sanctions, etc., etc. Did the
Israelis not hear Petraeus's testimony?
Further: Of course, whatever the outcome of such a raid, one of the inevitable ones would be the death of the peace
process, such as it is, on the very eve of Bibi's scheduled visit to Obama, which would have been, under any
circumstance, in light of the raid, profoundly humiliating for the president. Or are the Israelis bone stupid? I don't think so.

Like Father, Like Son? Netanyahu's Father Says Son Not
Serious About Two-State Solution.
July 8, 2009 1 Comment
In a controversial interview with Israel's Channel II News, the father of Prime Minister Netanyahu, Professor Benzion
Netanyahu, says that his son does not support a Palestinian state. The elder Netanyahu, claims that the prime Minister
told him he deliberately placed impossible conditions before the Palestinians.
Here are excerpts from the interview. When asked if his son really changed his position concerning a Palestinian state,
the 100 year-old historian unequivocally answered: (translation mine)
"He does not support. He supports such conditions that they (the Arabs) will never accept it. That is what I
heard from him. I didn't propose these conditions, he did. They will never accept these conditions. Not
one of them."
When asked about his own personal opinion about a Palestinian state, the senior Netanyahu stated:
Herzl and Nordau (fathers of zionist movement) did not labor to create a Palestinian state. This land is
Jewish land and not a land for the Arabs. There is no place here for Arabs, and there wont be a place
here for the Arabs. They will never agree to the conditions.

On Saturday night, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu visited the grave of his brother Yoni, who fell during the daring
rescue of hijacked Israelis in Entebbe, Uganda in 1976.
He and his wife Sarah decided to go to the gravesite on Mount Herzl 24 hours before the beginning of Remembrance Day
for Fallen Soldiers in order to prevent security tie-ups for thousands of other Israelis who will visit the cemetery Sunday
night and Monday.
The Netanyahus were moved emotionally after seeing for the first time a commemorative decoration that the IDF carved
into the gravestone of Yoni, who led the rescue operation and was the only soldier to die in the maneuver. One of his less
known heroic deeds is his saving a soldier from across Syrian lines in the Yom Kippur War in 1973.
Sirens will sound throughout Israel for one minute at 8 p.m. (1 p.m. EDT) Sunday night to mark the beginning of Memorial
Day for 22,682 Fallen Soldiers and 2,431 victims of Arab terrorist attacks following the re-establishment of the State of
Israel after 2,000 years. Another 1,500 civilians were killed between 1860 and the 1948 War for Independence, when
seven Arab nations attacked the fledging, newly declared state just three years after the Holocaust ended.
On Monday morning, a two-minute siren will sound at 11 a.m. (4 a.m. EDT). (IsraelNationalNews.com)

Netanyahu pleased: I didn't capitulate
Ben Caspit, Maariv, May 27 2010 [page 2 with front page lead; Hebrew original here and at bottom of post]
In the course of intimate conversations over the past few weeks with top political officials and civil servants, Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu has said, according to his interlocutors, that he managed to defeat the US administration.
Netanyahu is pleased by the fact that the Americans failed, so he said, to twist his arm and that ultimately, in the duel between
him and the Obama administration, he was the one who emerged with the upper hand. We did not make concessions on our red
lines and they failed to make us fold and to drag us to places we didn't want to go, said Netanyahu, according to people who
heard him speak.
Netanyahu is convinced that he is not going to be forced to extend the settlement construction freeze, which is due to expire in
September. According to senior officials in Jerusalem, an agreement has already been reached with the administration that the
Israeli government will not announce an extension of the construction freeze in the territories, and the Americans will "make
sure" that the Palestinians do not withdraw from the talks. Israel, however, will not take "aggressive" action and construction
will be resumed only in areas that are clearly within the consensus inside the settlement blocs.
The Prime Minister 's Bureau vigorously denied the above report. "The statements attributed to the prime minister are
incorrect," said a spokesman in the Prime Minister's Bureau. "They were not said by Netanyahu in any forum. The reason is
simple: the prime minister does not think that, Prime Minister Netanyahu holds in great esteem the commitment by President
Obama and the administration to Israel's security and their efforts to renew the peace process in our region."
Eli Bardenstein adds: The formal invitation that Netanyahu received yesterday to meet with President Obama next week might
attest to a radical change in the White House's attitude towards him. Political sources in Israel described the planned meeting
as "the peak of the campaign for Israel and the Jews that has been pursued by the Obama administration in the past number of
weeks." The sources said that the meeting was geared to put an end to the grave crisis that erupted some two months ago
between the Obama administration and Netanyahu over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and particularly over the continued
construction in East Jerusalem, and to mend the mistaken impression that was received as if Israel was "no longer an absolute
ally of the United States."
That crisis, which was initiated by the Americans, elicited fierce criticism in the United States, and sparked a desire among
members of the Obama administration to rectib) the situation. Another reason for the administration's desire to end the crisis
is the fear offailure in the upcoming Congressional elections in November. "The Democratic Party's coffers are empty.
Many Democrat members of Congress and Senators have complained that if the hazing of Israel were to continue, they
would be unable to obtain donations from Jews and were liable to lose the elections," said one source in Washington.
The prevalent assessment is that Netanyahu will be received far more warmly in Washington next week than he was two months
ago. This time the meeting will be covered by the media and the two leaders are expected to have their picture taken together
and to give statements to the media.

That said, sources in Washington noted that "Netanyahu is leery of the meeting with Obama and of walking into a trap once
again. He knows that the smiles notwithstanding, behind closed doors he is going to have to give answers to very difficult
questions, like 'how do you envision the end of the negotiations with the Palestinians.'"
Netanyahu is to begin his political travels today in Paris, where he is to attend the ceremony in honor of Israel's acceptance
into the OECD. The prime minister will be arriving in a city that is on strike, which is liable to impede his movement through
the city streets to the center of Paris for his meetings.

The Unnecessary Fall
A counter-history of the Obama presidency.
• John B. Judis
• August 12, 2010 I 12:00 am
On April 14, 2009, as Barack Obama's standing in the polls was beginning to slip, and as Tea Party demonstrators were
amassing in Washington for tax day protests, the president gave a lengthy address atGeorgetown University explaining the
"five pillars" of his economic policies. The speech was intended to promote a memorable slogan for Obama's program that
would evoke comparisons with Theodore Roosevelt's Square Deal, Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, and Lyndon Johnson's
Great Society.
Obama's contribution was to be the New Foundation. "We must lay a new foundation for growth and prosperity—a
foundation that will move us from an era of borrow and spend to one where we save and invest," he declared. Obama
would repeat the phrase seven times that day and on many more occasions over the next months. At Obama's private
White House dinner with presidential historians that June, the historians were no more impressed than the public with
the New Foundation as a slogan. "I don't think it's going to work," Robert Dallek warned. Doris Kearns Goodwin said it
sounded "like a woman's girdle."
One of these historians might have been able to forewarn Obama that the slogan had been unsuccessfully deployed by a
Democratic president once before. In his 1979 State of the Union address, Jimmy Carter began, "Tonight, I want to
examine in a broad sense the state of our American Union—how we are building a new foundation for a peaceful and a
prosperous world." Carter would use the phrase five times in the speech, including in its conclusion, where he asked
members of Congress to join him "in building that new foundation." Like Obama's effort, the phrase inspired, at most, a
few underwear jokes and was then forgotten.
Obama's evocation of Carter was obviously unintended—but the Man from Plains is indeed the specter now hanging over
his presidency. Of course, Obama has already accomplished more in his first 20 months than Jimmy Carter did during his
entire presidency. But there is a disturbing political resemblance between the two presidencies. Both men ran inspired
campaigns in which they positioned themselves above the scandals and partisan quarrels of their predecessors and
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770950 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770950 Date: 08/31/2015
initially stirred hopes of a "transformational" presidency. But, as presidents, both men somehow failed to connect with
large parts of the electorate.
To be sure, there are a number of very specific reasons why Carter and Obama landed in political trouble. Both men
contended with rising unemployment—Carter with rampant inflation as well—and voters' approval of a president and his
party tend to track closely with changes in the economy. Carter faced friction in his own party and the rise of a powerful
business lobby, and Obama has dealt with a Republican Party that has frustrated his dreams of a post-partisan presidency.
Yet the most important reason for their difficulties—evident in their inept attempts to brand their programs—has been an
inability to develop a politics that resonates with the public.
In the United States, politics pivots around the allegiance of the middle class, even as its identity has changed from
yeoman farmers and mechanics to store clerks, office workers, x-ray technicians, and small business owners. They are, in
Bill Clinton's words, "those who work hard and play by the rules." They are the central characters in a populist rhetoric
that goes back to the early republic. It depicts the middle class as embattled and threatened either from forces below
(impoverished immigrants, welfare cheaters, ghetto rioters) or above (Wall Street speculators, state bureaucrats, K Street
lobbyists). Populism can be embraced by Glenn Beck or Tom Harkin. It is intrinsically neither left-wing nor right-wing.
Politicians, such as Franklin Roosevelt or Ronald Reagan, who found a way of using populism's appeal during downturns
have enjoyed success, while those who have spurned it have suffered accordingly. If, in circumstances like the present one,
you don't develop a populist politics, your adversaries will use populism to define you as an enemy of the people. That's
what Carter discovered during the stagflation of the late '70s. And that's what has happened in the last 20 months of the
Great Recession to Barack Obama and to the Democratic Party he leads.
Obama took office with widespread popular support, even among Republicans, and some of his first efforts, including the
$800 billion stimulus, initially enjoyed strong public favor. But that wide appeal began to dissipate by the late spring of
2009. Disillusion with Obama fueled the November defeat of Democratic gubernatorial candidates in New Jersey and
Virginia. By January 2010, it was a crucial factor in Republican Scott Brown's astonishing victory over Martha Coakley in
Massachusetts.
In the postmortem debate over these defeats, some Democrats have blamed Obama's dogged pursuit of health care reform
while the economy was hemorrhaging jobs. That may have been a factor, but the real damage was done earlier. What
doomed Obama politically was the way he dealt with the financial crisis in the first six months of his presidency. In an
atmosphere primed for a populist backlash, he allowed the right wing to define the terms.
As Obama was delivering his inaugural address, the financial crisis was already in full swing; and it was already apparent
that financial speculation, outright fraud, and irresponsible and sometimes illegal housing-loan practices had played a
very large role in precipitating the crisis. The public was up in arms. But, instead of rallying the public against the "money
changers," as Roosevelt had done in his first inaugural, Obama, taking a leaf from Jimmy Carter's infamous "malaise"
speech, put the blame on the public as a whole. "Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and
irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new
age," he declared.
Over the next month, Obama would periodically criticize bankers after embarrassing revelations—at various times calling
the bonuses they gave themselves "shameful" and an "outrage"—but, after hearing complaints about his rhetoric from the
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770950 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770950 Date: 08/31/2015
bankers, he would back off. At a private meeting on March 28 with 13 Wall Street CEOs, the president, his spokesman
Robert Gibbs said, "emphasized that Wall Street needs Main Street and Main Street needs Wall Street." And, in his
Georgetown speech, Obama returned to his theme of collective responsibility. The recession, Obama said, "was caused by
a perfect storm of irresponsibility and poor decision-making that stretched from Wall Street to Washington to Main
Street."
Obama's policy followed the same swerving course as his rhetoric. One week, he would favor harsh restrictions on bank
and insurance-company bonuses, but, the next week, he would waver; one week, he would support legislation allowing
bankruptcy judges to reduce the amount that homeowners threatened with foreclosure owed the banks; the next week, he
would fail to protest when bank lobbyists pressured the Senate to kill these provisions. But, more importantly, Obama—in
sharp contrast to Roosevelt in his first months—failed to push Congress to immediately enact new financial regulations or
even to set up a commission to investigate fraud. (When Congress finally appointed a commission in July 2009, Obama
and his party put a milquetoast Democratic politician, former California State Treasurer Philip Angelides, in charge of it.)
Obama's appointments also conveyed an impression that he wanted to let Wall Street off the hook. He appointed Timothy
Geithner to be treasury secretary. Geithner claimed that he was not part of Wall Street, but, in his capacity as president of
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, he had served under a board of directors headed by JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie
Dimon. As New York Fed president, Geithner had been partly responsible for the decision to let Lehman Brothers go
under, for the unpopular tarp program, and for American International Group (MG) paying back its Wall Street creditors
with government money. Geithner chose as his chief of staff a former lobbyist for Goldman Sachs. Retiring Democratic
Senator Byron Dorgan told me, "Most Americans were reading about the massive compensations and bailouts, and the
administration largely hired people from the culture of Wall Street."
By the spring, Obama's apparent tilt to Wall Street had sparked a right-wing populist revolt in the country. The newly
formed Tea Party movement, Beck and Fox News, and a host of right-wing bloggers were leading the charge; but, in a less
extreme form, the general public shared their anger. In an early April New York Times/CBS News poll, the public
disapproved of Obama's aiding the banks by 58 percent to 33 percent. In this same poll, public approval of Obama's
handling of the economy began to fall. Pollsters who did focus groups also traced disillusionment with Obama's economic
policies to his handling of the financial crisis.
Congressman Barney Frank, who defends Obama's policies, acknowledges that the president's political difficulties began
with the revelation that MG, which had received $170 billion from the government, had paid out $165 billion in bonuses
to the division that had brought the company down. Geithner had known about the bonuses but insisted there were no
legal grounds to block them. (It then came out that Geithner had pressured Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris
Dodd to insert a provision in the stimulus bill that protected the bonuses.) "The pitchforks were out. It added injury to
injury," Frank says. That's when public opinion of Geithner plummeted. According to a Rasmussen poll, 24 percent had a
favorable view of Geithner and 44 percent an unfavorable one.
The public's view of the bank bailout and the AIG bonuses colored its view of the auto bailout, the stimulus, and health
care reform. One of the rallying cries for the populist opposition to Obama was "where's my bailout?" (Obama himself
acknowledged that it was "one of the most frequent questions" he was asked in letters.) The auto program became a
bailout for the Big Three CEOs; the stimulus became a bailout of government itself; and health care reform was a bailout
for the uninsured—or "reparations," as Rush Limbaugh put it. Wrote right-wing blogger Michelle Malkin, "hardworking
citizens were getting sick of being played for chumps" by "moochers, big and small, corporate and individual, trampling

over themselves with their hands out demanding endless bailouts." Obama and the Democrats were successfully portrayed
as aiding "the moochers," but not the "hardworking citizens." In American politics, that's a recipe for political disaster.
Some in the White House political operation recognized in the late spring that the administration's economic efforts were
being defined by right-wing populism and tried to push Obama to take a more populist tack. A group within the White
House began calling themselves the "pitchfork gang," but they would find their attempts to convince Obama to get tough
on Wall Street or on insurance companies undermined by Geithner and by National Economic Council head Larry
Summers, who were worried about upsetting business confidence. "There was a continual tension in the White House,"
says a person who was privy to the discussions. "One week, we would be very hot, and then, the next week, we would dial it
back."
By early January of this year, Obama was clearly losing the battle for the middle class. According to a CNN poll, 60 percent
of Americans thought Obama "had paid more attention to the problems faced by banks and other financial institutions"
than to the "problems faced by middle class Americans." Only 28 percent, barely more than a quarter, thought he had paid
more attention to the middle class. As Brown surged ahead of Coakley in the polls, the White House temporarily embraced
a populist approach. On January 14, Obama called the bank bonuses "obscene" and said, "we want our money back." In a
January 22 speech at Lorain County Community College in Elyria, Ohio (a far cry from Georgetown), Obama used the
word "fighting" 13 times and "fight" nine times. "I will not stop fighting for you," he declared.
But, faced with a falling stock market and anger from Wall Street, Obama once again turned conciliatory. On February io,
he said that he didn't "begrudge" the $17 million bonus awarded to Dimon and the $9 million to Goldman Sachs CEO
Lloyd Blankfein. "I know both guys. They are very savvy businessmen."
Obama's reluctance to rail against Wall Street might have led to a watered-down financial reform bill, or even no bill at all,
but, on April 16, the Securities and Exchange Commission indicted Goldman Sachs for fraud. The next week, an
emboldened Obama went to New York to criticize the bankers directly for their "failure of responsibility." As a result of the
indictment and Obama's rediscovery of his anger, Republicans became somewhat less obstructionist, moderate
Republicans broke with the party's leadership, and moderate Democrats fell into line. Congress produced a much stronger
bill than the Democrats had ever expected.
But Obama's embrace of populism has remained fitful and sporadic. After the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Verizon's
Ivan Seidenberg, the head of the Business Roundtable, criticized Obama for being anti-business in June, the president
dispatched Geithner, White House aide Valerie Jarrett, and Bill Clinton to appease the business community. Obama has
said enough to anger the CEOs, but he has failed to convey to the greater public that he is fighting for them.
Obama's unwillingness to buck Wall Street and the Business Roundtable, along with his delayed and muddled response to
the BP disaster in the Gulf, has eroded the public's confidence in his leadership. In Pew's midyear report card on Obama's
image, the greatest drop from February 2009 to this June was in the perception of Obama as a "strong leader." Voters will
sometimes tolerate policies they question from presidents like John Kennedy or Reagan, whom they regard as "strong,"
but not from politicians like Jimmy Carter, whom they regard as weak.
What of the other factors behind Obama's political difficulties? There is no doubt that, if the economy were growing faster,
and if unemployment were dropping below 9 percent, Obama and the Democrats would be more popular and not fearing a

November rout. But, unfortunately, the economy's sluggish recovery cannot be completely disentangled from the White
House's weak political performance.
In January, when the White House debated how large a stimulus to propose, Christina Romer, the head of the Council of
Economic Advisors, proposed a $1.2 trillion Keynesian jolt. David Obey, the chairman of the House Budget Committee,
told The Fiscal Times that Obama's Treasury Department asked initially for a $1.4 trillion bill. But the administration
finally proposed a stimulus between $700 and $800 billion that included large tax cuts that were more likely to stimulate
saving than consumption—and spending that would be unlikely to produce many jobs until the end of Obama's first term.
In the stimulus's first year, the administration spent only $17 billion of the $139 billion allocated for
infrastructure spending.
Prominent economists, including Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz, made the case that a much larger stimulus was
necessary to reverse (rather than merely reduce) the rise in unemployment, and that, if a modest stimulus failed to reduce
unemployment, Republicans would convince the public that the stimulus was toxic medication and would block additional
Keynesian measures. That argument has been proven sadly correct. Some White House advisers appear to have
underestimated the depth of the Great Recession. Others seem to have doubted the administration had the political clout
to get more from Congress.
But the White House might have gotten more if Obama had proclaimed a national economic emergency (which it was);
framed the issue in terms of rescuing the middle class from damage done by Wall Street speculators, short-sighted CEOs,
and Chinese mercantilism; and directly attacked Republicans as heartless obstructionists. When Obama belatedly made
this sort of case on the eve of the financial reform vote this year, he got a much stronger bill than anyone had anticipated.
So it's not clear that the failure to get a larger stimulus—which has ended up hurting the administration politically—wasn't
itself a result of political timidity.
The president has also suffered from an inability to explain to the public why he sought such a large stimulus and what he
thought it could accomplish. Obama's New Foundation speech at Georgetown was soon forgotten. Afterward, Obama, to
the dismay of Democrats in Congress and some of his White House aides, pretty much dropped the jobs issue. From then
to Labor Day, he devoted a July visit to Buffalo and an August stopover in southern Indiana to the issue—at a time when
the right wing was mobilizing against him. Obama didn't just fail to develop a consistent narrative about the economy; he
didn't really try.
Contrast Obama's attempt to develop a politics to justify his economic program with what Reagan did in 1982. Faced with
steadily rising unemployment, which went from 8.6 percent in January to 10.4 percent in November, Reagan and his
political staff, which included James Baker, Mike Deaver, and Ed Rollins, forged a strategy early that year calling for
voters to "stay the course" and blaming the current economic troubles on Democratic profligacy. "We are clearing away
the economic wreckage that was dumped in our laps," Reagan declared. Democrats accused them of playing "the blame
game," but the strategy, followed to the letter by the White House for ten months, worked. The Republicans were
predicted to lose as many as 50 House seats, but they lost only 26 and broke even in the Senate.
Some commentators have noted Reagan's popularity was even lower than Obama's. But, on key economic questions, he
did much better than Obama and the Democrats are currently performing—and voters expressed far greater patience with
Reagan's program. According to polls, even as the unemployment rate climbed, a narrow plurality still expressed
confidence that Reagan's program would help the economy. On the eve of the election, with the unemployment rate at a

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770950 Date: 08/31/2015
postwar high, a New York Times/CBS News poll found that 6o percent of likely voters thought Reagan's economic
program would eventually help the country. That's a sign of a successful political operation. If Obama could command
those numbers, Democrats could seriously limit their losses in November. But Obama has not been able to develop a
narrative that could convince people to trust him and the Democrats.
Why has the White House failed to convince the public that it is fighting effectively on its behalf? The principal culprit is
clearly Barack Obama. He has a strange aversion to confrontational politics. His aversion is strange because he was
schooled in it, working as a community organizer in the 198os, under the tutelage of activists who subscribed to teachings
of the radical Saul Alinsky. But, when Obama departed for Harvard Law School in 1988, he left Alinsky and adversarial
tactics behind.
The young lawyer who returned to Chicago and won a seat in the Illinois state Senate in 1996 practiced a very different
style of politics. Obama's principal accomplishments in Springfield were bills restricting lobbying and requiring
videotaping of confessions in potential death penalty cases. He was not a typical blue-collar, bread-and-butter Chicago
Democrat, but the kind of good government liberal that represents the upscale districts of the city, seeing in politics a
higher calling and ill at ease with (although not in open opposition to) the city's Democratic machine. He was also a post-
racial politician who eschewed the hard-edged, angry rhetoric of Jesse Jackson. (That, too, is oddly reminiscent of Carter,
who partly campaigned in 1976 as the white Southern antidote to George Wallace's angry racial populism.)
Obama carried this outlook into the U.S. Senate, into his campaign for the presidency, and then, into the presidency itself.
He is a cerebral, dispassionate, post-partisan; he wants to "end the political strategy that has been based on division," to
"turn the page" on the culture wars of the 1960s and the partisan battles of the 1990s. During the campaign, his aides
jokingly referred to him as the "black Jesus." While he can tolerate and even brush aside conflict, he is reluctant to actively
foment it. "In a time of crisis, we can't afford to govern out of anger," he declared in February 2009. During his campaign
and his first year in office, he held to a blind faith in bipartisanship, even as the Republicans voted as a bloc against his
legislation. He is, perhaps, ill-suited in these respects for an era of bruising political warfare.
His advisers have clearly reinforced these inclinations. In the campaign, they fashioned him as the outsider candidate of
"hope" and "change" and have extended this strategy into the presidency itself. They see him as standing above party. In a
meeting with congressional leaders last April, senior adviser David Axelrod rejected the complaint that Obama accorded
equal blame to Democrats and Republicans with his descriptions of the "cynical politics in Washington." Within the White
House, top aides still speak of promoting the Obama "brand." Organizing for America, the administration's campaign
organization, which is supposed to be focusing on the 2010 elections, recently devoted its resources to organizing parties
across the country to celebrate Obama's forty-ninth birthday.
These efforts to elevate Obama above the hurly-burly of Washington politics have been disastrous. Obama's image as an
iconic outsider has become the screen on which Fox News, the Tea Party, radicalright bloggers, and assorted politicians
have projected the image of him as a foreigner, an Islamic radical, and a socialist. He has remained "the other" that he
aspired to be during the campaign, but he and his advisers no longer control how that otherness is defined.
The White House and cabinet officials he appointed have reinforced his aversion to populism. As Jonathan Alter recounts
in The Promise: President Obama, Year One, Geithner and Summers repeatedly blocked attempts to get tough on Wall
Street on the grounds that doing so would threaten the recovery itself by upsetting the bankers. For most of his first year,
Alter writes, "Obama bought the Geithner-Summers argument that the banks were fragile and couldn't be confronted
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770950 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770950 Date: 08/31/2015
while they remained in peril." Its reluctance to come down on the bankers crippled the administration politically, making
it far more difficult for it to get its way with Congress on a second stimulus program that would have boosted the recovery
and Democrats' political prospects. Bad politics can trump good policy.
Populism has profound shortcomings as a worldview. It tends toward demagoguery. In its relentless focus on the middle
class, it can ignore or stigmatize those below it. It can prove hostile to a long-range scientific outlook. A more populist
Obama, for instance, might have postponed the battle for climate change legislation or national health insurance and
probably would have taken a weaker stand on immigration. But populism has been an indelible part of the American
political psyche, and those who are uncomfortable making populist appeals, like Hoover or Carter—or, more recently,
presidential candidate John Kerry—suffer the consequences at the polls.
If Obama's politics leads to a Republican takeover of one or both houses of Congress, and even to a Republican president
in 2012, then much of what Obama has accomplished could be undone. It's unlikely that a new Republican president and
Congress would actually repeal the health care or the financial reform bill. But the former could be starved of public funds
and deprived of regulatory oversight; and the latter could be neutered by a hostile treasury secretary and by weak or
hostile presidential appointees to the Securities and Exchange Commission or the new Consumer Financial Protection
Agency. Reform legislation needs administrations and congresses committed to reform. That is where politics has to come
in; and that's where the Obama administration, with its aversion to populism, has fallen short.

ith a victory like this..
The direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians
have preconditions - dictated by Israel.
By At.tiye Elder: Tags: Israel news M:ddist East peace
Two years ago, a basketball tournament was held at Tel Aviv University with the participation of student teams from 14
cOuntries, including a Palestinian team from the occupied territories. The games were purportedly held "without
preconditions," and every team put its best players on the court and aimed to win.
But unsurprisingly, the Shin Ben security service permitted only seven Palestinian players, including bench players, to
enter Israel. Some of the key players on the team were compelled to stay at home. After several losses (by 30 to 40
points), when it was the Palestinians turn to face a team from one of the Israeli colleges, their coach announced that he
had decided to spare his players another humiliation, and requested that the game be canceled.
The illuminating movie "Friendship Games," to be shown tonight on the Yes Docu channel (directed by Ram Levy, along
with Ibtisam IVIara'ana, Duki Dror and Yoav Shamir), documents the tournament, which was the initiative of Ed Peskowitz,
an American Jew and co-owner of the Atlanta Hawks basketball team in the NBA. The camera follows the Israeli coach to
the Palestinian locker room. After a long while, he tells his players that in order to even out the teams, two of them will join
the other side. He tells two of the Israeli bench players, including one known as Fats(); to don the shirts of the Palestinian
team. The game ends with a decisive victory for the Israeli team and a strong sense of missed opportunity..
The direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, like the basketball game, have preconditions. Not the
conditions demanded by the Palestinians, but conditions dictated by Israel. The refusal to freeze Israeli building in East
Jerusalem is a precondition, just like the demand to freeze it. The refusal to resume negotiations from the point where
talks between the previous prime minister, Ehud Olmert, and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas left off after the
Annapolis conference is no less a precondition than the demand to resume talks from square one.
The head referee, the president of the United States, has twisted the arms of his colleagues in the Quartet and is dragging
Abbas to Washington. Barack °barna decided that the negotiations will be held without any commitment regarding
building in East Jerusalem, and will be opened without even a declaration of principles stating that the talks will be held on
the basis of a general formula, like peace and security for Israel and a state along the 1967 borders for the Palestinians.
It's time to jump into the fountain in Rabin Square and cheer: The Palestinians have been shafted!
If Benjamin Netanyahu's aim is to play around as much as possible with the ball, and sometimes kick the opponent, then
he can really chalk up another victory. But Israel's success in the negotiations, like the success of the student team in the
tournament, is not measured by the terms "victory" or "defeat." What is victory over a weak Palestinian team worth, if it
was won in friendly games that ended with virtually no interaction between the participants? What is a political process
with the Palestinians worth if it erodes Abbas' standing and leads nowhere?

What have we to gain from humiliating our partner before his constituency on the way to the negotiating table? If Israel's
approach on every one of the core issues is that winning is everything, there's no point in bothering so many VIPs with
another unnecessary summit. Let's assume that we'll succeed, with the help of the Jewish power around Obama, to twist
Abbas' arm some more and extract, for example, an agreement in which he concedes sovereignty over the Temple
Mount. How many hours would such an agreement last?
All we need is a few more "victories" like the invitation to the launch of direct negotiations, "without preconditions," and
we'll lose our last partners to a settlement that will prevent Israel from turning into an apartheid state or a Palestinian state
(the binational model is a nightmare, as far as I'm concerned).
What will we do if Abbas announces that he's had enough of losing in purportedly friendly games, and that he's decided
the time has come to step down? Will we declare another victory and invite Hamas leader Khaled Meshal and Iranian
president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to the party?

COVERT OPERATIONS
The billionaire brothers who are waging a war against Obama.
by Jane Mayer
<http://www.newYo com/magazi ics/jane mayer,_,earc ?contributorName=ane%20maver>
AUGUST 30, 2010
David H. Koch in 1996. He and his brother Charles are lifelong libertarians and
have quietly given more than a hundred million dollars to right-wing causes.
On May 17th, a black-tie audience at the Metropolitan Opera House applauded as a
tall, jovial-looking billionaire took the stage. It was the seventieth annual
spring gala of American Ballet Theatre, and David H. Koch was being celebrated
for his generosity as a member of the board of trustees; he had recently donated
$2.5 million toward the company's upcoming season, and had given many millions
before that. Koch received an award while flanked by two of the gala's
co-chairs, Blaine Trump, in a peach-colored gown, and Caroline Kennedy
Schlossberg, in emerald green. Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, had
been a patron of the ballet and, coincidentally, the previous owner of a Fifth
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015

Avenue apartment that Koch had bought, in 1995, and then sold, eleven years
later, for thirty-two million dollars, having found it too small.
The gala marked the social ascent of Koch, who, at the age of seventy, has
become one of the city's most prominent philanthropists. In 2008, he donated a
hundred million dollars to modernize Lincoln Center's New York State Theatre
building, which now bears his name. He has given twenty million to the American
Museum of Natural History, whose dinosaur wing is named for him. This spring,
after noticing- the decrepit state of the fountains outside the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, Koch pledged at least ten million dollars for their renovation.
He is a trustee of the museum, perhaps the most coveted social prize in the
city, and serves on the board of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, where,
after he donated more than forty million dollars, an endowed chair and a
research center were named for him.
One dignitary was conspicuously absent from the gala: the event's third honorary
co-chair, Michelle Obama. Her office said that a scheduling conflict had
prevented her from attending. Yet had the 'First Lady shared the stage with Koch
it might have created an awkward tableau. In Washington, Koch is best known as
part of a family that has repeatedly funded stealth attacks on the federal
government, and on the Obama Administration in particular.
With his brother Charles, who is seventy-four, David Koch owns virtually all of
Koch Industries, a conglomerate, headquartered in Wichita, Kansas, whose annual

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
revenues are estimated to be a hundred billion dollars. The company has grown
spectacularly since their father, Fred, died, in 1967, and the brothers took
charge. The Kochs operate oil refineries in Alaska, Texas, and Minnesota, and
control some four thousand miles of pipeline. Koch Industries owns Brawny paper
towels, Dixie cups, Georgia-ea ific lumber, Stainmaster carpet, and Lycra, among
other products. Forbes ranks it as the second-largest private company in the
country, after Cargill, and its consistent profitability has made David and
Charles Koch—who, years ago, bought out two other brothers—among the richest men
in America. Their combined fortune of thirty-five billion dollars is exceeded
only by those of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett.
The Kochs are longtime libertarians who believe in drastically lower personal
' and corporate taxes, minimal social services for the needy, and much less
oversight of industry—especially environmental regulation. These views dovetail
with the brothers' corporate interests. In a study released this spring, the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst's Political Economy Research Institute
named Koch Industries one of the top ten air polluters in the United States. And
Greenpeace issued a report identifying the company as a "kingpin of climate
science denial." The report showed that, from 2005 to 2008, the Kochs vastly
outdid ExxonMobil in giving money to organizations fighting legislation related
to climate change, underwriting a huge network of foundations, think tanks, and
political front groups. Indeed, the brothers have funded opposition campaigns

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
against so many Obama Administration policies—from health-care reform to the
economic-stimulus program—that, in political circles, their ideological network
is known as the Kochtopus.
In a statement, Koch Industries said that the Greenpeace report "distorts the
environmental record of our companies." And David Koch, in a recent, admiring
article about him in New York, protested that the "radical press" had turned his
family into "whipping boys," and had exaggerated its influence on American
politics. But Charles Lewis, the founder of the Center for Public Integrity, a
. nonpartisan watchdog group, said, "The Koons are on a whole different level.
There's no one else who has spent this much money. The sheer dimension of it is
what sets them apart. They have a pattern of lawbreaking, political
manipulation, and obfuscation. I've been in Washington since Watergate, and I've
never seen anything like it. They are the Standard Oil of our :times."
few weeks after the Lincoln Center gala, the advocacy wing of the Americans for
Prosperity Foundation—an organization that David Koch started, in 2004—held a
different kind of gathering. Over the July
. 4th weekend, a summit called Texas
Defending the American Dream took place in a chilly hotel ballroom in Austin.
Though Koch freely promotes his philanthropic ventures, he did not attend the
summit, and his name was not in evidence. And on this occasion the audience was
roused not by a dance performance but by a series of speakers denouncing
President Barack Obama. Peggy Venable, the organizer of the summit, warned that
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
Administration officials "have a socialist vision for this country."
Five hundred people attended the summit, which served, in part, as a training
session for Tea Party activists in Texas. An advertisement cast the event as a
populist uprising against vested corporate power. "Today, the voices of .average
Americans are being drowned out by lobbyists and special interests," it said.
"But you can do something about it:" The pitch made no mention of its corporate
funders. The White House has expressed frustration that such sponsors have
largely eluded public notice. David Axelrod, Obama'-s senior adviser, said, "What
they don't say is that, in part, this is a grassroots citizens' movement brought
to you by a bunch of oil billionaires."
In April, 2009, Melissa Cohlmia, a company spokesperson, denied that the Kochs
had direct links to the Tea. Party, saying that Americans for Prosperity is "an
independent organization and Koch. companies do not in any way direct their
activities." Later, she issued a statement: "No funding has been provided by
Koch companies, the Koch foundations, or Charles Koch or David Koch specifically
to support the tea parties." David Koch told New York; "I've never been to a
tea-party event. No one representing the tea party has ever even approached me."
At the lectern in Austin, however, Venable-a longtime political operative who
draws a salary from Americans for Prosperity, and who has worked for Koch-funded
political groups since 1994-spoke less warily. "We love what the Tea Parties are
doing, because that's how we're going to take back America!" she declared, as

the crowd cheered. In a subsequent interview, sh described herself as an early
member of the movement, joking, "I was part of the Tea Party before it was
cool!" She explained that the role of Americans for Prosperity was to help
"educate" Tea Party activists on policy details, and to give them "next-step
training" after their rallies, so that their political energy could be
channelled "more effectively." And she noted that Americans for Prosperity had
provided Tea Party activists with lists of elected officials to target. She said
of the Kochs, "They're certainly our people. David's the chairman of our board.
I've certainly met with them, and I'm very appreciative of what they do."
Venable honored several Tea Party "citizen leaders" at the summit. The Texas
branch of Americans for Prosperity gave its Blogger of the Year Award to a young
woman named Sibyl West. On June 14th, West, writing on her site, described Obama
as the "cokehead in chief." In an online thread, West speculated that the
President was exhibiting symptoms of "demonic possession (aka schizophrenia,
etc.)." The summit featured several paid speakers, including Janine Turner, the
actress best known for her role on the television series "Northern Exposure."
She declared, "They don't want our children to know about their rights. They
don't want our children to know about a God!"
During a catered lunch, Venable introduced Ted Cruz, a former solicitor general
of Texas, who told the crowd that Obama was "the most radical President ever to
occupy the Oval Office," and had hidden from voters a secret agenda—"the
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015

government taking over our economy and our lives." Countering °barna, Cruz
proclaimed, was "the epic fight. of our generation!" As the crowd rose to its
feet and cheered, he quoted the defiant words of a Texan at the Alamo: "Victory,
or death!"
Americans for Prosperity has worked closely with the Tea Party since the
movement's inception. In the weeks before the first Tax Day protests, in April,
2009, Americans for Prosperity hosted a Web site offering supporters "Tea Party
Talking Points." The Arizona branch urged people to send tea bags to Obama; the
Missouri branch urged members to sign up for "Taxpayer Tea Party Registration"
and provided directions to nine protests. The group continues to stoke the
rebellion. The North Carolina branch recently launched a "Tea Party Finder" Web
site, advertised as "a hub for all the Tea Parties in North Carolina."
The anti-government fervor infusing the 2010 elect-ions represents a political
triumph for the Kochs. By giving money to "educate," fund, and organize Tea
Party protesters, they have helped turn their private agenda into a mass
movement. Bruce Bartlett, a conservative economist and a historian, who once
worked at the National Center for Policy Analysis, a Dallas-based think tank
that the Kochs fund, said, "The problem with the whole libertarian movement is
that it's been all chiefs and no Indians. There haven't been any actual people,
.like voters, who give a crap about it. So the problem for the Kochs has been
trying to create a movement." With the emergence of the Tea Party, he said,
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
"everyone suddenly sees that for the first time there are Indians out
there—people who can provide real ideological power." The Kochs, he said, are
"trying to shape and control and channel the populist uprising into their own
policies."
A Republican campaign consultant who has done research on behalf of Charles and
David Koch said of the Tea Party, "The Koch brothers gave the money that founded
it. It's like they put the seeds in the around. Then the rainstorm comes, and
the frogs come out of the mud—and they're our candidates!"
The Kochs and their political operatives declined requests for interviews.
Instead, a prominent New York public-relations executive who is close with the
Kochs put forward two friends: George Pataki, the former governor of New York,
and Mortimer Zuckerman, the publisher and real-estate magnate. Pataki, a
Republican who received campaign donations from David Koch, called him "a
patriot who cares deeply about his country." Zuckerman praised David's "gentle
decency" and the "range of his public interests."
The Republican campaign consultant said of the family's political activities,
"To call them under the radar is an understatement. They are underground!"
Another former Koch adviser said, "They're smart: This right-wing, redneck stuff
works for them. They see this as a way to get things done without getting dirty.
themselves." Rob Stein, a Democratic political strategist who has studied the
conaervative movement's finances, said that the Kochs are "at the epicenter of
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
the anti-Obama movement. But it's not just about Obama. They would have done the
same to Hillary Clinton. They did the same with Bill Clinton. They are out to
destroy progressivism."
ddly enough, the fiercely capitalist Koch family owes part of its fortune to
Joseph Stalin. Fred Koch was the son of a Dutch printer who settled in Texas and
ran a weekly newspaper. Fred attended PLI.T., where he earned a degree in
chemical engineering. In 1927, he invented a more efficient process for
converting oil into gasoline, but, according to family lore, America's major oil
companies regarded him as a threat and shut him out of the industry. Unable to
succeed at home, Koch found work in the Soviet Union. In the nineteen-thirties,
his company trained Bolshevik engineers and helped Stalin's regime set up
fifteen modern oil refineries. Over time, however, Stalin brutally purged
several of Koch's Soviet colleagues. Koch was deeply affected by the experience,
and regretted his collaboration. He returned to the U.S. In the headquarters of
his company, Rock Island Oil & Refining, in Wichita, he kept photographs aimed
at proving that some of those Soviet refineries had•been destroyed in the Second
World War. Gus diZerega, a former friend of Charles Koch, recalled, "As the
Soviets became a stronger military power, Fred felt a certain amount of guilt at
having helped build them up. I think it bothered him a lot."
In 1958, Fred Koch became one of the original members of the John Birch Society,
the arch-conservative group known, in part, for a highly skeptical view of
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
governance and for spreading fears of a Communist takeover. Members considered
President Dwight D. Eisenhower to be a Communist agent. In a self-published
broadside, Koch claimed that "the Communists have infiltrated both the Democrat '
and Republican Parties." He wrote admiringly of Benito Mussolini's suppression
of Communists in Italy, and disparagingly of the American civil-rights movement.
"The colored man looms large in the Communist plan to take over America," he
warned. Welfare was.a secret blot to attract rural blacks to cities, where they
would foment "a vicious race war." In a 1963 speech that prefigures the Tea
Party's talk of a secret socialist plot, Koch predicted that Communists would
"infiltrate the highest offices of government in the U.S. until the President is
a Communist, unknown to the rest of us:"
Koch tarried Mary Robinson, the daughter of a Missouri physician, and they had
four sons: Freddie, Charles, and twins, David and William. John Damgard, the
president of the Futures Industry Association, was David's schoolmate and
friend. He recalled that Fred Koch was "a real John Wayne type." Koch emphasized
rugged pursuits, taking his sons big-game hunting in Africa, and requiring them
1-o do -Farm labor at the family ranch. The Kochs lived in a stone mansion on a
large compound across from Wichita's country club; in the summer, the boys could
hear their friends splashing in the pool, but they were not allowed to join
them. "By instilling a work ethic in me at an early age, my father did me a b
favor, although it didn't seem like a favor back then," Charles has written. "By
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015

the time I was eight, he made sure work occupied most of my spare time." David
Koch recalled that his father also indoctrinated the boys politically. "He was
constantly speaking to us children about what was wrong with government," he
told Brian Doherty, an editor of the libertarian magazine Reason, and the author
of "Radicals for Capitalism," a 2007 history of the libertarian movement. "It's
something I grew up with—a fundamental point of view that big government was
bad, and imposition of government controls on our lives and economic fortunes
was not good."
David attended Deerfield Academy, in Massachusetts, and Charles was sent to
military school. Charles, David, and William all earned engineering degrees at
their father's alma meter, M.I.T.,, and later joined the family company. Charles
eventually assumed control, with David as his deputy; William's career at the
company was less successful. Freddie went to Harvard and studied playwriting at
the Yale School of Drama. His father reportedly disapproved of him, and punished
him financially. (Freddie, through a spokesperson, denied this.)
In 1967, after Fred Koch died, of a heart attack, Charles renamed the business
Koch Industries, in honor of his father. Fred Koch's will made his sons
extraordinarily wealthy. David Koch joked about his good fortune in a 2003
speech to alumni at Deerfield, where, after pledging twenty-five million •
dollars, he was made the school's sole "lifetime trustee." He said, "You might
ask: How does David Koch happen to have the wealth to be so generous? Well, let

me tell you a story. It all, started when I was a little boy. One day, my father
gave me an apple. I soon sold it for five dollars and bought two apples and sold
them for ten. Then I bought four apples and sold them for twenty. Well, this
went on day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year,
until my father died and left me three hundred million dollars!"
David and Charles had absorbed their father's conservative politics, but they
did not share all his views, according to diZerega, who befriended Charles in
the mid-sixties, after meeting him while browsing in a John Birch Society
bookstore in Wichita. Charles eventually invited him to the Kochs' mansion, to
participate in an informal political-discussion group. "It was pretty clear that
Charles thought some of the Birch .Scciety was bullshit," diZerega recalled.
DiZerega, who has lost touch with Charles, eventually abandoned right-wing
views, and became a political-science professor. He credits Charles with opening
his mind to political philosophy, which set him on the path to academia; Charles
is one of three people to whom he dedicated his first book. But diZerega
believes that the Koch brothers have followed a wayward intellectual trajectory,
transferring their father's paranoia about Soviet Communism to a distrust of the
U.S. government, and seeing its expansion, beginning with the New Deal, as a
tyrannical threat to freedom. In an essay, posted on Beliefnet, diZerega writes,
"As state socialism failed . . . the target for many within these organizations
shifted to any kind of regulation at all. 'Socialism' kept being defined
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
downwards."
Members• of the John Birch Society developed an interest in a school of Austrian
economists who promoted free-market ideals. Charles and David Koch were
particularly influenced by the work of Friedrich von Hayek, the author of "The
Road to Serfdom" (1944), which argued that centralized government planning led,
inexorably, to totalitarianism. Hayek's belief in unfettered capitaiisth has
proved inspirational to many conservatives, and to anti-Soviet dissidents;
lately, Tea Party supporters have championed his work. In June, the talk-radio
host Glenn Beck, who has supported the Tea Party rebellion, promoted "The Road
to Serfdom" on his show; the paperback soon became a No. 1 best-seller on
Amazon. (Beck appears to be a fan of the Kochs; in the midst of a recent on-air
parody of Al Gore, Beck said, without explanation, "I want to thank Charles Koch
for this information." Beck declined to elaborate on the relationship.)
Charles and David also became devotees of a more radical thinker, Robert
LeFevre, who favored the abolition of the state but didn't like the label
"anarchist"; he called himself an "autarchist." LeFevre liked to say that
"government is a disease masquerading as its own cure." In 1956, he opened an
institution called the Freedom School, in Colorado Springs. Brian Doherty, of
Reason, told me that "LeFevre was an anarchist figure who won Charles's heart,"
and that the school was "a tiny world of people who thought the New Deal was a
horrible mistake." According to diZerega, Charles supported the school
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
financially, and even gave him money to take classes there.
Throughout the seventies, Charles and David continued to build Koch Industries.
In 1980, William, with assistance from Freddie, attempted to take over the
company from Charles, who, they felt, had assumed autocratic control. In
retaliation, the company's board, which answered to Charles, fired William.
("Charles runs it all with an iron hand," Bruce Bartlett, the economist, told
me.) Lawsuits were filed, with William and Freddie on one side and Charles and
David on the other.. In 1983, Charles and David bought out their brothers' share
in the company for nearly a billion dollars. But the antagonism remained, and
litigation continued for seventeen more years, with the brothers hiring rival
private investigators; in 1990, they walked past one another with stony
expressions at their mother's funeral. Eventually, Freddie moved to Monaco,
which has no income tax. He bought historic estates in France, Austria, and
elsewhere, filling them with art, antiques, opera scores, and literary
manuscripts. William founded his own energy company, Oxbow, and turned to
yachting; he spent an estimated sixty-five million dollars to win the America's
Cup, in 1992.
With Charles as the undisputed chairman and C.E.O., Koch Industries expanded
.
rapidly. Roger Altman, who heads the investment-banking firm Evercore, told me
that the company's performance has been "beyond phenomenal." Charles remained in
Wichita, with his wife and two children, guarding his privacy while supporting
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
community charities. David moved to New York City, where he is an executive
vice-president of the company and the C.E.O. of its Chemical Technology Group. A
financial expert who knows Koch Industries well told me, "Charles is the
company. Charles runs ." David, described by associates as "affable" and "a
bit of a lunk," enjoyed for years the life of a wealthy bachelor. He rented a
yacht in the South of France and bought a waterfront home in Southampton, where
he threw parties that the Web site New York Social Diary likened to an "East
Coast version of Hugh Hefner's soirees." In 1996, he married Julia Flesher, a
fashion assistant. They live in a nine-thousand-square-foot duplex at 740 Park
Avenue, with their three children. Though David's manner is more cosmopolitan,
and more genial, than that of Charles, Brian Doherty, who has interviewed both
brothers, couldn't think of a single issue on which the brothers disagreed.
As their fortunes grew, Charles and David Koch became the primary underwriters
of hard-line libertarian politics in America. Charles's goal, as Doherty
described it, was to tear the government "out at the root." The brothers' first
major public step came in 1979, when Charles persuaded David, then thirty-nine,
to run for public office. They had become supporters of the Libertarian Party,
and were backing its Presidential candidate, Ed Clark, who was running against
Ronald Reagan from the right. Frustrated by the legal limits on campaign
donations, they contrived to place David on the ticket, in the Vice-Presidential
•
slot; upon becoming a candidate, he could lavish as much of his personal fortune
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
as he wished on the campaign. The ticket's slogan was "The Libertarian Party has
only one source of funds: You." In fact, its primary source of funds was David
Koch, who spent more than two million dollars on the effort.
Many of the ideas propounded in the 1980 campaign presaged the Tea Party
movement. Ed Clark told The Nation that libertarians were getting ready to stage
"a very big tea party," because people were "sick to death" of taxes. The
Libertarian Party platform called for the abolition of the F.B.I. and the
° .C.I.A., as well as of federal regulatory agencies, such as the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Department of Energy. The Party wanted to end Social
Security, minimum-wage laws, gun control, and all personal and corporate income
taxes; it proposed the legalization of prostitution, recreational drugs, and
suicide. Government should be reduced to only one function: the protection of
individual rights. William F. Buckley, Jr., a more traditional conservative,
called the movement "Anarcho-Totalitarianism."
That November,. the Libertarian ticket received only one per cent of the vote.
The brothers realized that their brand of politics didn't sell at the ballot
box. Charles Koch became openly scornful of conventional politics. •"It tends to
be a nasty, corrupting business," he told a reporter at the time. "I'm
interested in advancing libertarian ideas." According to Doherty's book, the
Kochs came to regard elected politicians as merely "actors playing out a
script." A longtime confidant of the Kochs told Doherty that the brothers wanted
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
to "supply the themes and words for the scripts." In order to alter the
direction of America, they had to "influence the areas where policy ideas
percolate from: academia and think tanks."
fter the 1980 election, Charles and David Koch receded from the public arena.
But they poured more than a hundred million dollars into dozens of seemingly
independent organizations. Tax records indicate that in 2008 the three main Koch
family foundations gave money to thirty-four political and policy organizations,
three of which they founded, and several of which they direct. The Kochs and
their company have given additional millions to political campaigns, advocacy
groups, and lobbyists. The family's subterranean financial role has fuelled
suspicion on the 'left; Lee Fang, of the liberal blog ThinkProgress, has called
the Kochs "the billionaires behind the hate."
Only the Kochs know precisely how much they have Spent on politics. Public tax
records show that between 1998 and 2008 the Charles G. Koch Charitable
Foundation spent more than forty-eight million dollars. The Claude R. Lambe
Charitable Foundation, which is controlled by Charles Koch and his slife, along
with two company employees and an accountant, spent more than twenty-eight
million. The David H. Koch Charitable Foundation spent more than a hundred and
twenty million. Meanwhile, since 1998 Koch Industries has spent more than fifty
million dollars. on lobbying. Separately, the company's political-action
committee, KochPAC, has donated some eight million dollars to political
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
campaigns, more than eighty per cent of it to Republicans. So far in 2010, Koch
Industries leads all other energy companies in political contributions, as it
has since 2006. In addition, during the past dozen years the Kochs and other
family members have personally spent more than two million dollars on political
contributions. In the second quarter of 2010, David Koch was the biggest
individual contributor to the Republican Governors Association, with a
million-dollar donation. Other gifts by the Koons may be untraceable; federal
tax law permits anonymous personal donations to politically active nonprofit
groups.
In recent decades, members of several industrial dynasties have spent parts of
their fortunes on a conservative agenda. In the nineteen-eighties, the Olin
family, which owns a chemicals-and-manufacturing conglomerate, became known for
funding right-leaning thinking in academia, particularly in law schools. And
during the nineties Richard Mellon Scaife, a descendant of Andrew Mellon, spent
millions attempting to discredit President Bill Clinton. An Rabin-Havt,
vice-president at the Democratic-leaning Web site Media Matters, said that the
Kochs' effort is unusual, in its marshalling of corporate and personal funds:
"Their role, in terms of financial commitments, is staggering."
Of course, Democrats give money, too. Their most prominent donor, the financier
George Soros, runs a foundation, the Open Society Institute, that has spent as
much as a hundred million dollars a year in America. Soros has also made
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
generous private contributions to various Democratic campaigns, including
Obamas. But Michael Vachon, his spokesman, argued that Soros's giving is
transparent, and that "none of his contributions are in the service of his own
economic interests." The Kochs have given millions of dollars to nonprofit
groups that criticize environmental regulation and support lower taxes for
industry. Gus diZerega, the former friend, suggested that the Kochs' youthful
idealism about libertarianism had largely devolved into a rationale for
corporate self-interest. He said of Charles, "Perhaps he has confused making
money with freedom."
Some critics have suggested that the Kochs' approach has subverted the purpose
of tax-exempt giving. By law, charitable foundations must conduct exclusively
nonpartisan activities that promote the public welfare. A 2004 report by the
National Committee for *Responsive Philanthropy, a watchdog group, described the
*Kochs' foundations as being self-serving, concluding, "These foundations give
money to nonprofit organizations that do research and advocacy on issues that
impact the profit margin of Koch Industries."
The Kochs have gone well beyond their immediate self-interest, however, funding
'organizations that aim to push the country in a libertarian direction. Among the
institutions that they have subsidized are the Institute for Justice,. which
files lawsuits opposing state and federal regulations; the Institute for Humane
Studies, which underwrites libertarian academics; and the Bill of Rights
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
Institute, which promotesa conservative slant on the Constitution. Many of the
organizations funded by the Kochs employ specialists who write position papers
that are subsequently quoted by politicians and pundits. David Koch has
acknowledged that the family exerts tight ideological control. "If we're going
to give a lot of money, we'll make darn sure they spend it in a way that goes
along with our intent," he told Doherty. "And if they make a wrong turn and
start doing things we don't agree with, we withdraw funding."
he Kochs' subsidization of a pro-corporate movement fulfills, in many ways, the
.vision laid out in a secret 1971 memo that Lewis Powell, then a Virginia
attorney, wrote two months before he was nominated to the Supreme Court. The
antiwar movement had turned its anger on defense contractors, such as Dow
Chemical, and Ralph Nader was leading a public-interest crusade against
corporations. Powell, writing- a report for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, urged
American companies to fight back. The greatest threat to free enterprise, he
warned, was not Communism or the New Left but, rather, respectable elements of
soCiety"—intellectuals, journalists, and scientists. To defeat them, he wrote,
business leaders needed to wage a long-term, unified campaign to change public
opinion.
Charles Koch seems to have approached both business and politics with the
deliberation of an engineer. "To bring about social change," he told Doherty,
requires "a strategy" that is "vertically and horizontally integrated," spanning
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
"from idea creation to policy development to education to grassroots
organizations to lobbying to litigation to political action." The project, he
admitted, was extremely ambitious. "We have a radical philosophy," he said.
In 1977, the Kochs provided the funds to launch the nation's first libertarian
think tank, the Cato Institute. According to the Center for Public Integrity,
between 1986 and 1993 the Koch family gave eleven million dollars to the
institute. Today, Cato has more than a hundred full-time employees, and its
experts and policy papers are widely quoted and respected by the mainstream
media. It describes itself as nonpartisan, and its scholars have at times been
critical of both parties. Put it has consistently pushed for corporate tax cuts,
reductions in social services, and laissez-faire environmental policies.
When President Obama, in a 2008 speech, described the science on global warming
as "beyond dispute," the Cato Institute took out a full-page ad in the Times to
contradict him. Cato's resident scholars have relentlessly criticized political
attempts to stop global warming as expensive, ineffective, and unnecessary. Ed
Crane, the Cato Institute's founder and president, told me that "global-warming
theories give the government more control of the economy."
Cato scholars have been particularly energetic in promoting the Climategate
scandal. Last year, private e-mails of climate scientists at the University of
East Anglia, in England, were mysteriously leaked, and their exchanges appeared
to suggest a willingness to falsify data in order to buttress the idea that
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
global warming is real. In the two weeks after the e-mails went public, one Cato
scholar gave more than twenty media interviews trumpeting the alleged scandal.
But five independent inquiries have since exonerated the researchers, and
nothing was found in their e-mails or data to discredit the scientific consensus
on global warming.
Nevertheless, the controversy succeeded in spreading skepticism about climate
change. Even though the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently
issued a report concluding that the evidence for global warming is unequivocal,
more Americans are convinced than at any time since 1997 that scientists have
exaggerated the seriousness of global warming. The Kochs promote this statistic
on their company's Web site but do not mention the role that their funding has
played in fostering such doubt.
In a 2002 memo; the Republican political consultant Frank Luntz wrote that.so
long as "voters believe there is no consensus about global warming within the
scientific community" the status quo would prevail. The key for opponents of
environmental reform, he said, was to question the science—a public-relations
strategy that the tobacco industry used effectively for years to forestall
regulation. The Kochs have funded many sources of environmental Skepticism, such
as the Heritage Foundation, which has argued that "scientific facts gathered in
the past 10 years do not support the notion of catastrophic human-made warming."
The brothers have given money to more obscure groups, too, such as the

Independent Women's Forum, which opposes the presentation of global warming as a
scientific fact in American public schools. Until 2008, the group was run by
Nancy Pfotenhauer, a former lobbyist for Koch Industries. Mary Beth Jarvis, a
vice-president of a Koch subsidiary, is on the group's board.
Naomi Oreskes, a professor of history and science studies at the University of
California, San Diego, is the co-author of "Merchants of Doubt," a new book that
chronicles various attempts by American industry to manipulate public opinion on
science. She noted that the Mocha, as the heads of "a company with refineries
and pipelines," have "a lot at. stake." She added, "If the answer is to phase out
fossil fuels, a different group of people are going to be making money, so we
shouldn't be surprised that they're fighting tooth and nail."
David Koch told New York that he was unconvinced that global warming has been
caused by human activity. Even if it has been, h said, the heating of the
planet will be beneficial, resulting in longer growing seasons in the Northern
Hemisphere. "The Earth will be able to support enormously more peoplebecause
far greater land area will be available to produce food," he said.
n the mid-eighties, the Kochs provided millions of dollars to George Mason
University, in Arlington, Virginia, to set up another think tank. Now known as
the Mercatus Center, it promotes itself as "the world's premier university.
source for market-oriented ideas—bridging the gap betWeen. academic ideas and
teal-world problems." Financial records show that the Koch family foundations

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
have contributed more than thirty million dollars to George Mason, much of which
has gone to the Mercatus Center, a nonprofit organization. "It's ground zero for
deregulation.policy in Washington," Rob Stein, the Demodratic strategist, said.
It is an unusual arrangement. "George Mason is a public university, and receives
public funds," Stein noted. "Virginia is hosting an institution• that the Kochs
practically control."
The founder of the Mercatus Center is Richard Fink, formerly an economist. Fink
heads Koch Industries' lobbying operation in Washington. In addition, he is the
president of the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation, the president of the
Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation, a director of the Fred C. and Mary R.
Koch Foundation, and a director and co-founder, with David Koch, of the
Americans for Prosperity Foundation.
Fink, with his many titles, has become the central nervous system of the
Kochtopus. He appears to have supplanted Ed Crane, the 'head or the Cato
Institute, as the brothers' main political lieutenant. Though David remains on
the board at Cato, Charles Koch has fallen out with Crane. Associates suggested
to me that Crane had been insufficiently respectful of Charles's management
philosophy, which he distilled into a book called "The Science of Success," and
trademarked under the name Market-Based Management, or M.B.M. In the book,
Charles recommends instilling a company's corporate culture with the
competitiveness of the marketplace. Koch describes M.B.M. as a "holistic system"
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015

containing "five dimensions: vision, virtue and talents, knowledge.processes,
decision rights and incentives." A top Cato Institute official told me that
Charles "thinks he's a genius. He's the emperor, and he's convinced he's wearing
clothes." Fink, by contrast, has been .far more embracing of Charles's ideas.
(Fink, like the Kochs, declined to be interviewed.)
At a 1995 conference for philanthropists, Fink adopted the language of economics
when speaking about the Mercatus Center's purpose. He said that grant-makers
should use think tanks and political-action groups to convert intellectual raw
materials into policy "products."
The Wall Street Journal has called the Mercatus Center "the mos.t important think
tank you've never heard of," and noted that fourteen of the twenty-three
regulations that President George W. Bush placed on a "hit list" had been
suggested first by Mercatus scholars. Fink told the paper that the Kochs have
"other means of fighting [their] battles," and that the Mercatus Center does not
actively promote the company's private interests. But Thomas McGarity, a law
professor at the University of Texas, who specializes in environmental issues,.
told me that "Koch has been constantly in trouble with the E.P.A., and Mercatus
has constantly hammered on the agency." An environmental lawyer who has clashed
with the Mercatus Center called it "a means of laundering economic aims." The
lawyer explained the strategy: "You take corporate money and give it to a
neutral-sounding think tank," which "hires people with pedigrees and academic

degrees who put out credible-seeming studies. But they all coincide perfectly
with the economic interests of their funders."
In 1997, for instance, the E.P.A. moved to reduce surface ozone, a form of
pollution caused, in part, by emissions from oil refineries. Susan Dudley, an
economist. who became a top official at the Mercatus Center, criticized the
proposed
. rule. The E.P.A., she argued, had not taken into account that smog-free
skies would result in more cases of skin cancer. She projected that if pollution
were controlled it would cause up to eleven thousand additional cases of skin
cancer each year.
In 1999, the District of Columbia Circuit Court took up Dudley's smog argument.
Evaluating the E.P.A.rule, the court found that the E.P.A. had "explicitly
disregarded" the "possible health benefits of ozone." In another part of the
opinion, the court ruled, 2-1, that the E.P.A. had overstepped its authority in
calibrating standards for ozone emissions. As the Constitutional Accountability
Center, a think tank, revealed, the judges in the majority had previously
attended legal junkets, on a Montana ranch, that were arranged by the Foundation
for Research on Economics and the Environment—a group funded by Koch family
foundations. The judges have claimed that the ruling was unaffected by their
attendance.
deas don't happen on their own," Matt Kibbe, the president of FreedomWorks, a
Tea Party advocacy group, told me. "Throughout history, ideas need patrons." The

Koch brothers, after helping to create Cato and Mercatus, concluded that think
tanks alone were not enough to effect change. They needed a mechanism to deliver
those ideas to the street, and•to attract the public's support. In 1984, David
Koch and Richard Fink created yet another organization, and Kibbe joined them.
The group, Citizens for a Sound Economy, seemed like a grassroots movement, but
according to the Center for Public Integrity it was sponsored principally by the
Kochs, who provided $7.9 million between 1986 and 1993. Its mission, Kibbe said,
"was to take these heavy ideas and translate them for mass America. . . . We
read the same literature Obama did about nonviolent revolutions—Saul Alinsky,
Gandhi, Martin Luther King. We studied the idea of the Boston Tea Party as an
example of nonviolent, social change. We learned we needed boots on the ground to
sell ideas, not candidates." Within a few years, the group had mobilized fifty
paid field workers, in twenty-six states, to rally voters behind the Kochs'
agenda. David and Charles, according to one participant, were "very controlling,
very top down. You can't build an organization with them. They run it."
Around this time, the brothers faced a political crisis. In 1989, the Senate
Select Committee on Indian Affairs investigated their business and released a
scathing report accusing Koch Oil of "a widespread and sophisticated scheme to
steal crude oil from Indians and others through fraudulent mismeasuring." The
Kochs admitted that they had improperly taken thirty-one million dollars' worth
of crude oil, but said that it had been accidental. Charles Koch told committee •

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
investigators that oil measurement is "a very uncertain art."
To defend its reputation, Koch Industries hired Robert Strauss, then a premier
Washington lobbyist; the company soon opened an office in the city. A grand jury
was convened to investigate the allegations, but it eventually disbanded,
without issuing criminal charges. According to the Senate report, after the
committee hearings Koch operatives delved into the personal lives of committee
staffers, even questioning an ex-wife. Senate investigators were upset by the
Kochs' tactics. Kenneth Ballen, the counsel to the Senate committee, said,
"These people have amassed such unaccountable power!"
By 1993, when Bill Clinton became President, Citizens for a Sound Economy had
become a prototype for the kind of corporate-backed opposition campaigna that
have proliferated during the Obama era. The group waged a successful assault on
Clinton's proposed B.T.U. tax on energy, for instance, running- advertisements,
staging media events, and targeting opponents. And it mobilized anti-tax rallies
outside the Capitol-rallies that NPR described as "designed to strike fear into
the hearts of wavering Democrats." ban Glickman, a former Democratic congressman
from Wichita, who supported the B.T.U. tax, recalled, "I'd been in Congress
eighteen years. The Kochs actually engaged against me and funded my opponent.
They used a lot of resources and effort-their employees, too." Glickman suffered
a surprise defeat. "I can't prove it, but I think I was probably their victim,"
he said.

The Kochs continued to disperse their money, creating slippery organizations
with generic-sounding names, and this made it difficult to ascertain the extent
of their influence in Washington. In 1990, Citizens for a Sound Economy created
a spinoff group, Citizens for the Environment, which called acid rain and other
environmental problems "myths." When the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette investigated
the matter, it discovered that the spinoff group had "no citizen membership of
its own."
In 1997, another Senate investigation began looking into what a minority report
called "an audacious plan to pour millions of dollars in contributions into -
Republican campaigns nationwide without disclosing the amount or source," in
order to evade .campaign-finance laws. A shell corporation, Triad Management, had
paid more than three million dollars for attack ads in twenty-six House races
and three Senate races. More than half of the advertising money came from an
obscure nonprofit group, the Economic Education Trust. The Senate committee's
minority report suggested that "the trust was financed in whole or in part by
Charles and David Koch of Wichita, Kansas." The brothers were suspected of
having secretly paid for the attack ads, most of which aired in states where
Koch Industries did business. In Kansas, where Triad Management was especially
active, the funds may have played a decisive role in four of six federal races.
The Kochs, when asked by reporters if they had given the money, refused to
comment. In 1998, however, the Wall Street Journal confirmed that a consultant
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
on the Kochs' payroll had been involved in the scheme. Charles Lewis, of the
Center for Public Integrity, described the scandal as "historic. Triad was the
first time a major corporation used a cutout"—a front operation—"in a
threatening way. Koch Industries was the poster child of a company run amok."
uring the Clinton Administration, the energy industry faced increased scrutiny
and regulation. In the mid-nineties, the Justice Department filed two lawsuits
against Koch Industries, claiming that it was responsible for more than three
hundred oil spills, which had released an estimated three million gallons of oil
into lakes and rivers. The penalty was potentially as high as two hundred and
fourteen million dollars. In a settlement, Koch Industries paid a record
thirty-million-dollar civil fine, and agreed to spend five million dollars on
environmental projects.
In 1999, a jury found Koch Industries guilty of negligence and malice in the
deaths of two Texas teen-agers in an explosion that resulted from a leaky
underground butane pipeline. (In 2001, the company paid an undisclosed
settlement.) And in the final months of the Clinton Presidency the Justice
Department levelled a ninety-seven-count indictment against the company, for
covering up the discharge of ninety-one tons of benzene, a carcinogen, from its
refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas. The company was liable for three hundred and
fifty million dollars in fines, and four Koch employees faced up to thirty-five
years in prison. The Koch Petroleum Group eventually pleaded guilty to one
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
criminal charge of covering up environmental violations, including the
falsification of documents, and paid a twenty-million-dollar fine. David
Uhlmann, a career prosecutor who, at the time, headed the environmental-crimes
section at the Justice Department, described the suit as "one of the most
significant cases ever brought under the Clean Air Act." He added,
"Environmental crimes are almost always motivated by economics and arrogance,
and in the Koch case there was a healthy dose of both."
During the 2000 election campaign, Koch Industries spent some nine hundred
thousand dollars to support the candidacies of George N. Bush and other
Republicans. During the Bush years, Koch Industries and other fossil-fuel
companies enjoyed remarkable prosperity. The 2005 energy bill, which Hillary
Clinton dubbed the Dick Cheney Lobbyist Energy Bill, offered enormous subsidies
and tax breaks for energy companies. The Kochs have cast themselves as deficit
hawks, but, according to a study by Media Matters, their companies have
benefitted from nearly a hundred million dollars in government contracts since
2000.
In 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy was accused of illegitimately throwing its
weight behind Bush's reelection. The group's Oregon branch had attempted to get
Ralph Nader on the Presidential ballot, in order to dilute Democratic support
for John Kerry, Critics argued that it was illegal for a tax-exempt nonprofit
organization to donate its services for partisan political purposes. (A
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
complaint was filed with the Federal Election Commission; it was dismissed.)
That year, internal rivalries at Citizens for a Sound Economy caused the
organization to split apart. David Koch and Fink started a new group, Americans
for Prosperity, and they hired Tim Phillips to run it. Phillips was a political
veteran who had worked with Ralph Reed, the evangelical leader and Republican
activist, co-founding Century Strategies, a campaign-consulting company that
became notorious for its ties to the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff.
Phillips's online biography describes him as an expert in "grasstops" and
"grassroots" political organizing. The Kochs' choice of Phillips signalled an
even greater toughness. The conservative operative Grover Norquist, who is known
for praising "throat slitters" in politics, called Phillips "a grownup who can
make things happen."
Last year, Phillips told the Financial Times that Americans for Prosperity had
only eight thousand registered members. Currently, its Web site claims that the
group has "1.2 million activists." Whatever its size, the Kochs' political
involvement has been intense; a former employee of the Cato Institute told me
that Americans for Prosperity "was micromanaged by the Kochs." And the brothers'
investment may well have paid off: Americans for Prosperity, in concert with the
•
family's other organizations, has been instrumental in disrupting the Obama
Presidency.
In January, 2008, Charles Koch wrote in his company newsletter that America
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
could be on the verge of "the greatest loss of liberty and prosperity since the
1930s." That October, Americans for Prosperity held a conference of conservative
operatives at a Marriott hotel outside Washington. Erick Erickson, the
editor-in-chief of the conservative blog RedState.com, took the lectern, thanked
David Koch, and vowed to "unite and fight . . . the armies of the left!" Soon
after Obama assumed office, Americans for Prosperity launched "Porkulus" rallies
against Obama's stimulus-spending measures. Then the Mercatus Center released a
report claiming that stimulus funds had been directed disproportionately toward
Democratic districts; eventually, the author was forced to correct the report,
but not before Rush Limbaugh, citing the paper, had labelled Obama's program "a
slush fund," and Fox News and other conserVative outlets had echoed the
sentiment. (Phil Kerpen, the vice-president for policy at Americans for
Prosperity, is a contributor to the Fox News Web site. Another officer at
Americans for Prosperity, Walter Williams, often guest-hosts for Limbaugh.)
Americans for Prosperity also created an offshoot, Patients United Now, which
organized what Phillips has estimated to be more than three hundred rallies
against health-care reform. At one rally, an effigy of a Democratic congressman
was hung; at another, protesters unfurled a banner depicting corpses from
Dachau. The group also helped organize the "Kill the Bill" protests outside the
Capitol, in March, where Democratic supporters of health-care reform alleged
that they were spat on and cursed at. Phillips was a featured speaker.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
Americans for Prosperity has held at least eighty events targeting cap-and-trade
legislation, which is aimed at making industries pay for the air pollution that
they create. Speakers for -the group claimed,, with exaggeration, that even
back-yard barbecues and kitchen stoves would be taxed. The group was also
involved in the attacks on Obama's "green jobs" czar, Van Jones, and waged a
crusade against international climate talks. Casting his group as a champion of
ordinary workers who would be hurt by environmentalists, Phillips went to
Copenhagen last year and staged a protest outside the United Nations conference
on climate change, declaring, "We're a grasaroots organization. . . . I think
it's unfortunate when wealthy children of wealthy
. families . . want to send
unemployment rates in the United States up to twenty per cent."
Grover Norquist, who holds a weekly meeting for conservative leaders in
Washington, .including representatives from Americans for Prosperity, told me
that last summer's raucous rallies were pivotal in undermining Obama's agenda
The Republican leadership in Congress, he said, "couldn't have done it without
August, when people went out on the streets. It discouraged deal-makers"—Republicans
who might otherwise have worked constructively with Obama. Moreover, the
appearance of growing public opposition to Obama affected corporate donors on K
Street. "K Street is a three-billion-dollar weathervane," Norquist said. "When
Obama was 'strong, the Chamber of Commerce said, 'We can work with the Obama
Administration.' But that changed when thousands of people went into the street
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
and 'terrorized' congressmen. August is what changed it. Now that Obama is weak,
people are getting tough."
As the first anniversary of Obama's election approached, David Koch came to the
Washington area to attend a triumphant Americans for Prosperity gathering.
Obama's poll numbers were falling fast. Not a single Republican senator was
working with the Administration on health care, or much else. Pundits were
writing about Obama's political ineptitude, and Tea Party groups were accusing
the President of initiating "a government takeover." In a speech, Koch said,
"Days like today bring to reality the vision of our board of directors when we
started this organization, five years ago." He went on, "We envisioned a mass
movement, a state-based one, but national in scope, of hundreds of thousands of
American citizens from all walks of life standing up and fighting for the
economic freedoms that made our nation the most prosperous society in history. .
. . Thankfully, the stirrings from California to Virginia, and from Texas to
Michigan, show that more and more of our fellow-citizens are beginning to see
the same truths as we do."
While Koch didn't explicitly embrace the Tea Party movement that day, more
recently he has come close to doing so, praising it for demonstrating the
"powerful visceral hostility in the body politic against the massive increase in
government power, the massive efforts to socialize this country." Charles Koch,
in a newsletter sent to his seventy thousand employees, compared the Obama
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015

Administration to the regime of the Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez. The Kochs'
sense of imperilment is somewhat puzzling. Income inequality in America is
greater than it has been since the nineteen-twenties, and since the seventies
the tax rates of the wealthiest have fallen more than thoseof the middle class.
Yet the brothers' message has evidently resonated with-voters: a recent poll
found that fifty-five per cent of Americans agreed that Obama is a socialist.
Americans for Prosperity, meanwhile, has announced that it will spend an
additional forty-five million dollars before the midterm elections, in November.
Although the group is legally prohibited from directly .endorsing candidates, it
nonetheless plans to target some fifty House races and half a dozen Senate
races, staging rallies, organizing door-to-door canvassing, and running ads
aimed at "educating voters about where candidates stand."
Though the Kochs have slowed Obama's momentum, their larger political battle is
far from won. Richard Fink, interviewed by FrumForum.com this spring, said, "If
you look at where we've gone from the year 2000 to now, with the expansion of
government spending and a debt burden that threatens to bankrupt the country,
doesn't look very good at all." He went on, "It looks like the infrastructure
that was built and nurtured has not carried the. day." He suggested that the
Kochs needed "to get more into the practical, day-to-day issues of governing."
n 1991, David Koch was badly injured in a plane crash in Los Angeles. He was the
sole passenger in first class to survive. As he was recovering, a routine
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
physical exam led to the discovery of prostate cancer. Koch received treatment,
settled down, started a family, and reconsidered his life. As he told Portfolio,
"When you're the only one who survived in the front of the plane and everyone
else died—yeah, you think, 'My God, the good Lord soared me for some greater
purpose.' My joke is that I've been busy ever since, doing all the good work I
can think of, so He can have confidence in me."
Koch began giving spectacularly large donations to the arts and sciences. And he
became a patron of cancer research, focussing on prostate cancer. In addition to
his gifts to Sloan-Kettering, he gave fifteen million dollars to New
York-Presbyterian Hospital, a hundred and twenty-five million to M.I.T. for
cancer research, twenty million to Johns Hopkins University, and twenty-five
millior. to the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston. In response to his
generosity, Sloan-Kettering gave Koch its Excellence in Corporate Leadership
Award. In 2004, President Bush named him to the National Cancer Advisory Board,
which guides the National Cancer Institute.
Koch's corporate and political roles, however, may pose conflicts of interest.
For example, at the same time that David Koch has been casting himself as a
champion in the fight against cancer, Koch Industries has been lobbying to
prevent the E.P.A. from classifying formaldehyde, which the company produces in
great quantities, as a "known carcinogen" in humans.
Scientists have long known that formaldehyde causes cancer in rats, and several
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015
major scientific studies have concluded that formaldehyde causes cancer in human
beings—including one published last year by the National Cancer Institute, on
whose advisory board Koch. sits. The study tracked twenty-five thousand patients
for an average of forty years; subjects exposed to higher amounts of
formaldehyde had significantly higher rates of leukemia. These results helped
lead an expert panel within the National Institutes of Health to conclude that
formaldehyde should be categorized as a known carcinogen, and be strictly
controlled by the government. Corporations have resisted regulations on
formaldehyde for decades, however, and Koch Industries has been a large funder
of members of Congress who have stymied the E.P.A., requiring it to defer new
regulations until more studies are completed.
Koch Industries became a major producer of the chemical in 2005, after it bought
Georgia-Pacific, the paper and wood-products company, for twenty-one billion
dollars. Georgia-Pacific manufactures formaldehyde in its chemical division, and
uses it to produce various wood products, such as plywood and laminates. Its
annual production capacity for formaldehyde is 2.2 billion pounds. Last
December, Traylor Champion, Georgia-Pacific's vice-president of environmental
affairs, sent a formal letter of protest to federal health authorities. He wrote
that the company ",strongly disagrees" with the N.I.H. panel's conclusion that
formaldehyde should be treated as a known human carcinogen. David Koch did not
recuse himself from the National Cancer Advisory Board, or divest himself of
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770951 Date: 08/31/2015

company stock, while his company was directly lobbying the government to keep
formaldehyde on the market. (A board spokesperson said that the issue of
formaldehyde had not come up.)
James Huff, an associate director at the National institute for Environmental
Health Sciences, a division of the N.I.H., told me that it was "disgusting" for
Koch to be serving on the National Cancer Advisory Board: "It's just not good
for public health. Vested interests should not be on the board." He went on,
"Those boards are very important. They're very influential as to Whether N.C.I.
goes into formaldehyde or not. Billions of dollars are involved in
formaldehyde."
Harold Varmus, the director of the National Cancer Institute, knows David Koch
from Memorial Sloan-Kettering, which he used to run. He said that, at
Sloan-Kettering, "a lot of people who gave to us had large business interests.
The one thing we wouldn't tolerate in our board members is tobacco." When told
of Koch Industries' stance on formaldehyde, Varmus said that he was "surprised."

message, as amplified by the exhibit's Web site, is that "key human adaptations
evolved in response to environmental instability." Only at the end of the
exhibit, under the headline "OUR SURVIVAL CHALLENGE," is it noted that levels of
carbon dioxide are higher now than they have ever been, and that they are
projected to increase dramatically in the next century. No cause is given for
this development; no mention is made of any possible role played by fossil
fuels. The exhibit makes it seem part of a natural continuum. The accompanying
text says, "During the period in which humans evolved, Earth's temperature and
the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere fluctuated together." An
interactive game in the exhibit suggests that humans will continue to adapt to
climate change in the future. People may build "underground citieS," developing
"short, compact bodies" or "curved spines," so that "moving around in tight
spaces will be no problem."
Such ideas uncannily echo the Koch message. The company's January newsletter to
employees, for instance, argues that "fluctuations in the earth's climate
predate humanity," and concludes, "Since we can't control Mother Nature, let's
figure out how to get along with her changes." Joseph Romm, a physicist who runs
the Web site ClimateProgressorg, is infuriated by the Smithsonian's
presentation. "The whole exhibit whitewashes the modern climate issue," he said.
"I think the Kochs wanted to be seen as some sort of high-minded company,
associated with the greatest natural-history and science museum in the country.

But the truth is, the exhibit is underwritten by big-time polluters, who are
underground funders of action to stop efforts to deal with this threat to
humanity. I think the Smithsonian should have drawn the line."
Cristian Samper, the museum's director, said that.the exhibit is not about
climate change, and described Koch as "one of the best donors we've had, in my
tenure here, because he's very interested in the content, but completely hands
off." He noted, "I don't know all the details of his involvement in other
issues."
The Kochs have long depended on the public's not knowing all the details about
them. They have been content to operate what David Koch has called "the largest
company that you've never heard of." But with the growing prominence of the Tea
Party, and with increased awareness of the Kochs' ties to the movement, the
brothers may find it harder to deflect scrutiny. Recently, President Obama took
aim at the Kochs' political network. Speaking at a Democratic National Committee
fund-raiser, in Austin, he warned supporters that the Supreme Court's recent
ruling in the Citizens United case--which struck down laws prohibiting direct
corporate spending on campaigns—had made it even easier for big companies to
hide behind "groups with harmless-sounding names like Americans for Prosperity."
. 0bama said, "They don't have to say who, exactly, Americans for Prosperity are.
You don't know if it's a foreign-controlled corporation"—or even, he added, "a
big oil company

"He will tell you

he is led to break

is it really strong

he demands

Jean-Paul Sartre,
"Anti-Semite and
Jew"
I am not sure when I first detected
the noxious fumes that would
envelop the conservative
movement in the Obama era. It
might have been early on, in
April 2009, when I visited a
series of gun shows in rural
California and Nevada. Perusing
tables piled high with high-
caliber semi-automatic weapons
and chatting with anyone in my
vicinity, I heard urgent warnings
of mass roundups, concentration
camps, and a socialist
government in Washington.
"These people that are purchasing
these guns are people that are
worried about what's going on in
this country," a gun dealer told
me outside a show in Reno.
"Good luck Obama," a young gun
enthusiast remarked to me. "We
outnumber him 100 to 1." At this
time, the Tea Party movement
had not even registered on the
national media's radar.
In September 2009, I led a panel
discussion about this book inside
an auditorium filled with nearly
100 students and faculty at the
University of California-
Riverside. Beside me sat Jonathan
Walton, an African-American
professor of religious studies and
prolific writer, and Mark Takano,
an erudite, openly gay former
Democratic congressional
candidate and local community
college trustee. In the middle of
our discussion, a dozen College
Republicans stormed the front of
the stage with signs denouncing
me as a "left-wing hack" while a
hysterical young man leaped from
the crowd, blowing kisses
mockingly at Takano while
heckling Walton as a "racist."
Afterward, university police

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015
officers insisted on escorting me
to my ride after the right-wing
heckler attempted to follow me as
he shouted threats.
Who was this stalker? Just a
concerned citizen worried about
taxes? His name was Ryan Sorba
and he was an operative of a
heavily funded national
conservative youth outfit, the
Intercollegiate Studies Institute.
Besides founding dozens of
Republican youth groups across
the country, Sorba has devoted an
exceptional amount of energy to
his interest in homosexuals. His
intellectual output consists of a
tract titled The Born Gay Hoax,
arguing that homosexuality is at
once a curable disease and a
bogus trend manufactured by
academic leftists. Adding to his
credentials, Sorba has a history of
run-ins with the law, he explained
when I called him about the
order.
My encounter with this
aggressive right-wing cadre
seemed a strange, isolated event.
But the hostility turned out to be
symptomatic of the intensifying
campaign to delegitimize
President Obama and his allies in
Congress. The Right's days of
rage were only beginning.
Through his first year in office,
Obama seemed oblivious to the
threat of the far right. He
campaigned against partisanship,
declaring that there were "no red
states" and no "conservative
America." Apparently, he thought
it was merely a contrivance or
myth that there were people who
rejected science, demonized gays,
assailed minority and women's
rights -- or that they genuinely
believed in what they said.

Speaking of changing
Washington, Obama seemed to
think that the entire history of
politics since the rise of Reagan
and the Right and their strategies
of polarization was not deeply
rooted but a superficial problem
attributable to certain "divisive"
personalities, easily wiped away
with gestures toward
bipartisanship. His view of the
parties was that they were simply
mirror images sharing
fundamental beliefs but separated
by "partisans." The skilled and
devoted community organizer
could bring them together.
Many of his supporters in the
media, often part and parcel of
political wars over the years,
reinforced and amplified his
innocence, proclaiming he was
the one at last who could "bridge•
the partisan divide." Andrew
Sullivan, a disaffected
conservative who once called
critics of George W. Bush
policies "fifth columnists" but
now fervently supporting Obama,
wrote that the new president was
destined to become "a liberal
Reagan who can reunite
America." This optimism
pervaded the Obama White
House as the president and his
aides sought out Republicans
willing to vote for his programs.
After all, why couldn't we all just
get along?
In his autobiographical book The
Audacity of Hope, Obama
highlighted a key component of
his political strategy: "I serve as a
blank screen on which people of
vastly different political stripes
project their own views." Once he
was elected, conservatives
concluded that they could reverse
Obama's strength by transforming
him into a human tableau for the

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015
most fearsome images they could
conjure.
Obama's multiracial background
was crucial in cultivating
resentment among the shock
troops. Those who rejected
Obama's legitimacy to serve as
president on the basis of his
background gave birth to the
"Birther" movement that sought
to challenge his citizenship. The
movement's most visible figure,
and therefore the most eccentric,
was Orly Taitz, a dentist and self-
trained lawyer who had
immigrated from the former
Soviet republican of Moldova to
Israel before settling in the
conservative bastion of Orange
County, California. Convinced by
claims on the far-right Web site
WorldNetDaily that Obama
planned to create a "civilian
national security force," Taitz
told me she "realized that Obama
was another Stalin--it's a cross
between Stalinist USSR and
Hitler's Germany."
After becoming transfixed by
online conspiracy theories
claiming Obama's family had
forged his birth certificate in
Hawaii, Taitz snapped into
action. She filed a lawsuit in
November 2008 with California
Secretary of State Debra Bowen
demanding an investigation into
Obama's eligibility to serve as
president. Taitz's plaintiff in the
case was Wiley Drake, an Orange
County radio preacher and former
second vice president of the
Southern Baptist Convention who
once publicly prayed for Obama's
death. While her lawsuit went
nowhere, and subsequent suits
earned her angry rebukes from
judges, Taitz became an instant
media sensation, delivering

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015
heavily accented screeds against
Obama before friendly
interviewers from Sean Haimity
to CNN's Lou Dobbs, who Taitz
called her "greatest supporter"
and who was eventually fired as
an indirect result of his hosting of
her.
In March 2009, Texas Rep.
Randy Neugebauer signed on to a
Birther bill proposing that future
presidential candidates must
prove their citizenship before
becoming eligible to campaign.
The Birther movement had found
its voice in goverment and made
an indelible impact on the
Republican grassroots. By June
2009, 28 percent of Republican
respondents to a Kos/Research
2000 poll said they thought
Obama wasn't born in the United
States, while 30 percent "weren't
sure." "Obama should be in the
Big House," Taitz shrieked to me,
"not the White House!"
When Obama announced health
care reform as the first major
initiative of his administration,
the conservative movement
activated a campaign of
demonization -- transformational
politics -- designed to turn Obama
into the "Other," making him
seem as unfamiliar, and therefore
as threatening, as possible. When
the president urged the Congress
to deliver a health care reform bill
in 2009, the Right staged a living
theater of political hatred,
Obama's dream of bipartisanship
transformed into a nightmarish
version of "Marat/Sade." On
September 12, 2009, tens of
thousands of far-right activists
belonging to a loose
confederation of anti-government
groups called the Tea Party
Patriots converged on

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015
Washington's National Mall for a
giant protest against the Obama
health care plan. The date was
significant: Fox News's top-
ranked talk show host Glenn
Beck had declared the birth of the
"9-12 Project" to restore the sense
of unity -- and siege mentality --
that Americans experienced on
September 11, 2001. But this
time, Obama -- not Osama -- was
the enemy.
While covering the rally, I
witnessed sign after sign
declaring Obama a greater danger
to America's security than al-
Qaida; demonstrators held images
that juxtaposed Obama's face
with images of evildoers from
Hitler to Pol Pot to Bin Laden;
others carried signs questioning
Obama's status as a U.S. citizen.
"We can fight al-Qaida, we can't
kill Obama," said an aging
demonstrator. Another told me,
"Obama is the biggest Nazi in the
world," pointing to placards he
had fashioned depicting Obama
and House Majority Leader
Nancy Pelosi in SS outfits.
According to another activist,
Obama's agenda was similar to
Hitler's: "Hitler took over the
banking industry, did he not? And
Hitler had his own personal secret
service police. [The community-
organizing group] ACORN is an
extension of that."
The seemingly incongruous Tea
Party propaganda recalled signs
waved by right-wing Jewish
settlers during rallies against
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin and his support of the
peace process, portraying him as
an SS officer and as the French
collaborator Marshall Petain. In
1995, amid the provocative
atmosphere, a young right-wing
Jewish zealot assassinated Rabin.

The Israeli tragedy was a
cautionary example of targeted
hatred leading to violence.
Members of the Tea Party
"Patriots" did not seem to care
that their rhetoric was irrational,
or that comparing Obama to
Hitler and Stalin was
contradictory and obviously
hyperbolic. Their motives were
entirely negative. By purging
government of the multicultural
evil that had seized power
through illicit means (several
activists told me they believed
ACORN helped Obama steal the
election), they were convinced
that a mythical golden American
yesteryear would return. They
had no interest in building
anything new or even articulating
an agenda, much less discussing
the merits of policies. The Tea
Party's primary concern was
cultural purification -- freedom
from, not freedom to. Against the
dark image of the president and
his liberal allies, Tea Party
activists defined themselves as
the children of light. The racial
subtext was always transparent.
The Tea Party's strategy rested on
a guerrilla campaign of chaos and
sabotage designed not only to
intimidate Democrats but also to
disorient independent voters who
might have supported health care
reform. The Tea Partiers were
convinced this would be an easy
feat, since they believed the
majority of the country was on
their side -- that they represented
the "Real America." At the 9-12
rally Matt Kibbe, one of the
march organizers, told the crowd
that ABC News was reporting
that 1 million to 1.5 million
people were in attendance,
something ABC denied, saying
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015
"ABCNews.com reported an
approximate figure of 60,000 to
70,000 protesters." Then Armey
led the crowd in a chant of
"Freedom works! Freedom
works!" Unknown to most of the
Tea Partiers, they were intoning
the name of a corporate-funded
Beltway advocacy group, not the
battle cry of Mel Gibson William
Wallace in Braveheart.
Contrary to its image as a
grassroots movement mobilized
to stifle the machinations of
Washington elites, the Tea Party
movement was the creation of a
constellation of industry-funded
conservative groups with close
Republican ties. The movement's
leading puppet-master was Dick
Armey, who directed resources
and talking points to the Tea
Party "Patriots" from his
Washington, D.C.-based
advocacy group, FreedomWorks.
Among the corporate clients of
Armey's lobbying firm, which he
was forced to leave as a result of
his involvement in the Tea
Parties, was the pharmaceutical
giant Bristol Myers Squibb, a
company with a clear interest in
defeating health care reform.
(Armey's other "real American"
clients included the Marxist terror
cult, People's Mojahedin of Iran,
which received funding and
assistance from Saddam Hussein
in order to launch terrorist strikes
throughout the 1990's against
Iranian civilian targets.) Armey
collected a consulting fee of
$250,000 directly from
FreedomWorks and $300,000
from allied astroturf front groups.
FreedomWorks paid out much of
its money to an assortment of
Republican political consultants.
If Armey was the Tea Party king,

Sarah PalM was eager to be
crowned the Tea Party queen.
Just days after Obama's
inauguration, Palin abruptly quit
her job as Alaskan governor to
vie for the honor. PalM's motives
for quitting became clear when
she inked a lucrative deal to write
her political memoir Going
Rogue, signed on as a regular
contributor to Fox News, and
received $1 million an episode for
a reality show on cable television,
"Sarah Palin's Alaska." PalM's
book tour, which sent her through
Middle America in a luxuriously
outfitted bus, resembled both a
presidential campaign and a
traveling carnival.
Whether or not PalM intends to
run for president, her growing
media presence has magnified her
influence within the Republican
Party. Yet the ever-expanding
Palin phenomenon was greeted
with hostility by Republican
politicos desperately seeking to
expand the party's base after the
drubbing in 2008. Former
McCain campaign manager Steve
Schmidt warned that Palin's
nomination in 2012 would be
"catastrophic" for the GOP. His
doomsday prediction was backed
by an October Gallup poll
revealing her as one of the most
polarizing and unpopular political
figures in the country with a
disapproval rating of over 50
percent. Unfortunately for
Schmidt and other party
pragmatists, those who approve
of Palin represent the heartbeat of
the Republican Party, its most
fervent activists, and cannot be
dissuaded from following her,
even if she is leading the party off
a cliff.
A November 2009 special

congressional election in New
York's heavily Republican 23rd
district was the first major test of
Palin's power. Along with a
parade of nationally recognized
conservatives, Palin endorsed
Doug Hoffman, an unknown far-
right third-party candidate closely
allied with the Tea Party, helping
to force a popular moderate
Republican politician, Dede
Scozzafava, from the race. In the
end, Palin's ideological purge in
upstate New York led to an
improbable Democratic victory,
the first in that district in more
than 100 years. After the disaster
Palin and her allies claimed
victory, insisting they had at least
hastened the purge of
ideologically impure Republicans
from the party. She went on to
endorse Rand Paul, the son of
right-wing libertarian Rep. Ron
Paul and a candidate in
Kentucky's GOP senatorial
primary, while Dick Cheney went
out of his way to endorse Rand's
regular Republican opponent,
Trey Grayson, the Kentucky
secretary of state.
Following the Tea Party script of
avoiding social issues like
abortion and gay marriage in
order to obscure the large
presence of the Christian Right
within the movement's ranks, the
self-described "hardcore pro-
lifer" Palin recast herself as a
libertarian concerned primarily
with issues of "economic
freedom." She claimed the
Democratic "cap and trade" plan
to limit carbon emissions would
harm the livelihood of blue-collar
workers, and she assailed health
care reform as a Trojan Horse for
"socialism" (though she admitted
her family "used to hustle over
the border" to take advantage of
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015

Canada's single-payer health care
system). But no Palin attack had
as much effect as the one she
blasted out on her Facebook page
claiming the Obama health care
plan included a provision for
"death panels" that would
recommend euthanasia for
severely ill patients like her
Down syndrome-afflicted son,
Trig. With the click of a button,
Palin transformed the tone of the
health care debate from rancorous
to poisonous.
The source of Palin's "death
panels" smear was a practiced
propagandist, former New York
Lieutenant Governor Betsy
McCaughey. When President Bill
Clinton introduced health care
reform during his first term,
McCaughey falsely claimed in an
article published in the New
Republic and widely circulated by
Republicans, that the plan would
force consumers to drop their
private plans and buy into the
government's program (the article
would go on to win a National
Magazine Award and then be
retracted years later by the New
Republic's editors). Now she was
back in the spotlight, pushing a
rumor that would be voted by the
non-partisan fact-checking Web
site Politifact.com as "the lie of
2009." McCaughey's latest
innuendo was boosted by the cult
of political crank Lyndon
LaRouche, which mobilized to
push the rumor into the
mainstream.
In June 2009, one of LaRouche's
top lieutenants publicly
confronted Ezekiel Emanuel, the
National Institute of Health's

seeking to reintroduce Hitler's T-
4 program to kill the handicapped
through health care reform.
"President Obama has put in
place a reform apparatus reviving
the euthanasia of Hitler Germany
in 1939, that began the genocide
there," LaRouche staffer Anton
Chaitkin charged. Soon,
LaRouche's followers were on
street corners around the country
with posters depicting Obama
with a Hitler moustache. At a
town hall forum on health care
reform hosted by Democratic
Rep. Barney Frank, a LaRouche
follower waved one of the
Obama-as-Hitler posters and
demanded, "Why do you continue
to support a Nazi policy, as
Obama has expressly supported
this policy?"
Two months later, after Palin
whispered the rumor on
Facebook, prominent
conservatives from former
Speaker of the House Newt
Gingrich to ranking Senate
Finance Committee member
Charles Grassley parroted her
claims before audiences of
indignant Tea Partiers. Not to be
outdone, Glenn Beck devoted an
extended rant on his show to the
reality of death panels. Echoing
the LaRouche cultists, Beck
accused Ezekiel Emanuel of "the
devaluing of human life, putting a
price on each individual." He
thundered, "The death panel is
not a firing squad. Rationing is
inevitable and they know it!"
The death panel rumor served a
variety of functions, all useful to
the movement, but not necessarily
to the Republican Party. Most
importantly, the rumor resonated
both with hard-core libertarians
who resented the very existence

of the federal government and
Christian Right activists who
viewed the legalization of
abortion as a slippery slope to
government-sponsored
euthanasia. The hysteria it
engendered helped repair the rift
exposed by the Terri Schiavo
charade in 2005, when the
evangelical conservative James
Dobson publicly clashed with
Armey, the libertarian leader,
over the right of the government
to interfere in a private family
matter of life and death.
The slurring of Obama as a sort
of sleeper agent crypto-Muslim
helped bring the neoconservatives
back into the fray. The new neo-
con generation was led by Dick
Cheney's daughter, Liz, who
founded an anti-Obama advocacy
group, Keep America Safe, by
leveraging donations from pro-
Israel sources. Asked by CNN's
Larry King about the Birther
movement that was challenging
Obama's status as an American
citizen, Liz Cheney remarked,
"One of the reasons you see
people so concerned about this is
people are uncomfortable with
having for the first time ever, I
think, a president who seems so
reluctant to defend the nation
overseas." With the libertarians,
Christian Right, and the neo-cons
seated around the same table,
united in resentment of the alien
president, the conservative
movement was whole again.

University of Colorado, have
demonstrated the connection
between fear of death and
intensification of conservative
attitudes. The findings help
explain the effectiveness of the
death panel rumor and
insinuations by conservative
figures that Obama was not truly
American and somehow
sympathetic to Islamic terrorists.
Indeed, these seemingly irrational
smears were guided by tactical
reasoning, calculated to agitate
voters with constant reminders of
their own mortality. Whether or
not Independents responded, the
rhetoric of death kept the Tea
Party crowd in a persistent state
of panic and rage, ensuring a
standing army ready to fan out to
rallies and town halls at the first
sign of liberal malfeasance.
Obama's first year in office was
marked by more than raucous
protests; there were several
disturbing murders committed by
far-right extremists. In April
2009, a 22-year-old neo-Nazi
wannabe named Richard
Poplawsi mowed down a SWAT
team of Pittsburgh cops, killing
three. Poplawski's best friend told
reporters the young killer "grew
angry recently over fears Obama
would outlaw guns." Later it was
discovered that Poplawski had
posted a video clip to a neo-Nazi
Web site portraying Fox's Glenn
Beck contemplating the existence
of concentration camps. (After a
characteristically thorough
investigation, Beck conceded
they were not real.) On another
occasion, the killer posted a video
promoting Tea Party rallies. A
month after the Pittsburgh
bloodbath, Scott Roeder, a
supporter of the militant anti-
abortion group Operation Rescue,
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015
shot Dr. George Tiller to death
while he prayed at his church in
Wichita, Kansas. Tiller was
declared fair game by the anti-
abortion movement because of
his role as Kansas's only late-term
abortion provider. During at least
28 episodes of Bill O'Reilly's
"O'Reilly Factor," O'Reilly had
referred to Tiller as "Tiller the
baby killer," a criminal guilty of
"Nazi stuff." "I wouldn't want to
be [Tiller] if there is a Judgment
Day," O'Reilly proclaimed.
In August 2009, a middle-aged
professional named George
Sodini walked into a health club
in suburban Pittsburgh and
gunned down three women. The
mainstream press explained
Sodini's motives away by homing
in on passages in his online
diaries describing his loneliness,
inability to convince women to
have sex with him, and descent
into chronic masturbation. Nearly
every major media outlet omitted
or ignored a long deranged entry
in which Sodini projected his
sexual frustration onto Obama,
whom he seemed to view as a
symbol of black male virility and
predation.
The day after Obama's election
victory, Sodini wrote: "Good luck
to Obama! He will be successful.
The liberal media LOVES him.
Amerika has chosen The Black
Man. Good! In light of this I got
ideas outside of Obama's plans
for the economy and such. Here it
is: Every black man should get a
young white girl ... Kinda a
reverse indentured servitude
thing. Every daddy know when
he sends his little girl to college,
she be ... real good. I saw it. 'Not

[ellipses in original]."
In another posting to an anti-
Clinton forum in 1994, during the
height of the Republicans'
Whitewater investigation, Sodini
revealed that he had purchased a
bumper sticker reading, "Stop
Socialism, Impeach Clinton,"
from a National Review ad. A
year later, Sodini ranted on an
anti-government militia site, "I
am convinced that more drastic
action is required to bring the
country back to the Constitutional
order that it was 200 years ago. I
don't think any group of political
leaders will achieve this for us."
Whether or not Sodini's murder
spree was motivated by his
political passions, he was
pathologically death-driven and
fixated on the phantasmagoria of
right-wing imagery. In his final
diary entry, Sodini proclaimed,
"Death lives!"
More than any other media figure
of the Obama era, Glenn Beck
encouraged the campaign of
racial demonization and
conspiracy that consumed the Tea
Party "Patriots." During a
broadcast of "Fox and Friends,"
Beck opined that Obama "has
exposed himself over and over
and over again as a guy who has a
deep-seated hatred for white
people, or the white culture." As
evidence, Beck pointed to White
House green-jobs czar Van Jones,
an African American former
community organizer who was
eventually forced to resign as a
direct result of Beck's crusade.
From there, Beck targeted another
black Obama adviser, Valerie
Jarrett, highlighting her ties to
ACORN while upholding her and
Jones as evidence of Obama's
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015
"socialist" agenda. In another
broadcast, Beck played an audio
clip of unidentified African
Americans referring to "Obama
money" as they collected welfare
checks in Detroit. Then he
showed footage of members of a
Kansas City-based youth group
practicing a step show, a
traditional African-American
group dance apparently
unfamiliar enough to Beck and
his transfixed audience that he
felt at liberty to claim the footage
as evidence that "Obama's SS"
was being trained across inner-
city America.
In September 2009, Beck
relentlessly targeted ACORN, the
Right's new favorite hobgoblin,
admitting that he intended to use
the poor people's advocacy group
to distract his viewers from the
health care debate. "Trust me,"
Beck said, "Everybody now says
they're going to be talking about
health care. I don't think so." (His
statement was reminiscent of
Rush Limbaugh's scandal-
mongering remark during the
early Clinton administration:
"Whitewater is about health
care.") Beck promptly cued up a
series of hidden camera videos
shot by conservative youth
activists James O'Keefe and
Hannah Giles inside ACORN
field offices. In the videos,
O'Keefe baited African-American
staffers into making statements
explaining that Giles, who
claimed she was a prostitute,
could obtain low-income housing.
O'Keefe edited in images of
himself clad in an outlandish
pimp costume to create the
impression that he was dressed
that way during the meetings with
ACORN; however, Giles later
admitted her partner had lied

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015
about wearing his costume to
farther ineriminate ACORN. In
the end. ACORN was exonerated
of all criminal wrongdoing while
in a separate incident O'Keefe
was arrested and charged with a
federal crime after he and several
conservative pals disguised
themselves as telephone
repairmen and attempted to
wiretap phone lines in the office
of Senator Mary 'Landrieu of
Louisiana. Like Ryan Sorba,
O'Keefe and his posse were
movement cadres paid and
directed by well-funded
conservative outfits; O'Keefe had
been trained by the Leadership
Institute, the right-wing youth
Froup that nurtured leadinG, lights
like Jack Abriunoff, Karl Rove,
Ralph Reed, and Jeff Gannon.
While O'Keefe and his buddies
plea-bargained with prosecutors,
Beck basked in his formula for
success. His show earned the
hithest ratings at Fox News,
topping network franchises like
O'Reilly and Sean Hannity. In the
process. Beck's opinions became
firmly implanted in the nervous
systems of Tea Party activists.
"Glenn Beck has taught us
everything we know," a
demonstrator at the 9-12 rally told
Me. "He's opened our eyes to so
much."
But unlike the right-wing radio
warhorses who helped usher in
Newt Gin<trich's Republican
counter-revolution of 1994, Beck
was not an authentic product of
the movement. When Rush
Limbaugh first began dominating
the AM airwaves, Beck was
mired in the world of mid-level
commercial radio, delivering
corny yarns about lesbians and
celebrity trash in hopes of
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015

becoming the next Howard Stem.
By night, as he has tirelessly
recounted, he medicated his
anxiety with cocaine and alcohol,
destroying his first marriage in
the process. "We remember
Glenn from the womanizing, the
drinking, the drugs. Everybody
who knew him at the time saw
what a: complete mess he was," a
shock jock from Tampa, Florida,
who called himself Bubba the
Love Sponge remarked to me
during a broadcast of his
nationally syndicated show.
Like Dusty Rhodes, the pseudo-
populist demagogue of Elia
Kazan's 1957 film, A Face in the
Crowd. Beck was a self-
destructive drifter Who might
have been crumpled up with a
bottle of Mad Dog 20/20 in an
alleyway or been locked away in
,a prison cell had fame not found
him first. Beck was only able to
stabilize his life when he made
his escape from freedom.,
marrying a conservative Mormon,
converting to her religion, and
transmuting his urge to abuse
drugs into conservative radio
diatribes. When Beck first broke
into television On CNN's
Headline News Channel, he
struggled to articulate a coherent
political world view. If he
distinguished himself from other
big-time conservative .hosts in
any way, he did so through
strained and often snide attempts
at humor, remnants of his failed
radio career. Nevertheless, with
help from his liberal agent,
Matthew Hiltzik, Beck snagged a
primetime slot at Fox News in
early 2009. Around this same
time, Beck began promoting the
work of an arcane Mormon
conspiracy-peddler named W.
Clean Skousen, whom he
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015
described as his political lodestar.
Suddenly, Beck had something
more to offer than irritable mental
gestures.
Thanks to Beck's designation of
Skousen's pseudohistorical tract
The 5000 Year Leap as "required
reading" on the Web site of his 9-
12 Project, and his promotion of
the book on his show, the
previously obscure Skousen.
became the Hidden imam of the
Tea Party movement. By the
summer of 2009, Skousen's Leap
was among the top 10 books on
Amazon.com and a fixture on
literature tables at Tea Party
gatherings. It went from selling a
puny couple of thousand copies in
2007 to selling over 200,000
copies in 2009. Just why the book
generated such an instant appeal
is difficult to understand. It is
little more than a slapdash of
quotes from the Founding
Fathers, often taken out of
context and deliberately
oversimplified, to explain why
America is the greatest nation in
history. in the process, Skousen
claims that church and state
separation is un-American, that
"coercive taxation" is communist,
and that marriage is the
underpinning of a free society.
Benjamin Franklin., who wrote at
length on the merits of "amours"
with "old women," and who
famously solicited prostitutes and
fathered a son of out of wedlock,
was the ultimate authority
Skousen quoted on the
importance of marriage.
Though Skousen claims the
Founders as the world's foremost
source of eternal wisdom, he
buttressed his points with fringe
sources like the conspiracist
Norman Dodd's screeds about the
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015
Illuminati. According. to Skousen,
Dodd claimed that "powerful
influences congregating in the
United States" like the
Rockefellers and the Rothschilds
had forced the United States into
World War I. Skousen published
Dodd's manifestoes in his obscure
journal Freemen's Digest, which
he founded for the express
purpose of propagating
conspiracies.
Skousen's paranoid politics were
an outgrowth of his participation.
in extreme anti-communist
groups during the 1950s. He
boasted of a close friendship with
then-FBI director J. Edgar
Hoover and said he provided him
with research on communist
plots, claims disputed by FBI
historians. (During a recent
interview. Skousen's son, Paul,
told me that contrary to rumors of
Hoover's cross-dressing and
homosexual dalliances, he would
set the top cop up on blind dates
with live women.) Skousen was
fired from his job as Salt Lake
City's police chief for, in the
words of the city's conservative
Mormon mayor, "conduct[ing]
hi.s office as chief of police in
exactly the same manner in which
the communists operate their
government." From there,
Skousen sailed off to the far
shores of the Right-peddling
conspiracy tracts like The Naked
Communist-, and earning
condemnation from his beloved
FBI, which accused him in an
internal memo of "promoting
[his] own anti-communism for
obvious financial purposes."
Skousen's vocal support for the
far-right John Birch Society's
claim that communists controlled

cost him the support of the
corporate backers who had paid
for his Red-bashing lecture tours.
He went off the radar for several
years, returning during the late
1960s to accuse the Jewish
Rothschild family of secretly
bankrolling everyone from Ho
Chi Minh to the civil rights.
movement. By the late 1970s,
even the Church of Latter Day
Saints distanced itself from
Skousen and his conspiracy
theories. His work fell through
the margins and might have
disappeared entirely had Beck not
revived it, turning The 5000 Year
Leap into the bible of the Tea
Party movement. Journalist
Alexander Zaitchik observed in
his authoritative profile of
Skousen on Salon.com that
Skousen's renewed influence
through Beck and the Tea Party
'suggests that the modern base of
the Republican Party is headed to
a very strange place."
Besides influencing Beck,
Skousen's teachings inspired one
of the Tea Party movement's most
visible grassroots celebrities,
retired Sheriff Richard Mack. I
met Mack in February at a far-
right rally just outside of
Montgomery, Alabama. On a
makeshift stage towed into the
middle of a rodeo arena by a
pickup truck, Mack recalled with
reverence his mentorship by
Skousen, who he said taught him
everything he needed to know
about the Constitution. Mack
urged his spellbound audience to
stockpile ammo and store food.
"If you control the food supply,"
Mack warned, "you control the
people. And that's the first step to
slavery."
Already a hero to conservatives

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015
for successfully suing the Clinton
administration over the provision
in the Brady Handgun Violence
Prevention Act requiring law
enforcement to conduct criminal
background checks of gun
purchasers, Mack reemerged in
the Obama era as the archetypal
local lawman who vowed to resist
the tyrannical federal
government. Along with a few
dozen former and active military
and law enforcement personnel,
Mack helped form a self-styled
Tea Party militia called the
Oathkeepers. Galvanized by their
fear of creeping socialism, the
Oathkeepers solemnly swore to
refuse tyrannical federal orders
such as cooperating with foreign
troops and forcing Americans
into concentration camps.
Because the group's members
trained for combat, the vow came
with suggestion of armed
resistance.
Besides Mack, the Oathkeepers
attracted a coterie of militia
movement retreads into its ranks.
The most well-established figure
was Mike Vanderboegh, a
longtime militia fanatic who
published a booklet in the mid-
1990s entitled Strategy and
Tactics for a Militia Civil War,
calling for sniper attacks on "war
criminals, secret policemen, rats."
With Obama in office,
Vandeboegh churned out anti-
government screeds on right-wing
blogs with renewed passion and
supported his efforts by cashing
in the $1,300 in federal disability
compensation he received each
month.
For all the energy the far right
exerted in its campaign to
strangle Obama's agenda, it was a
Democrat who posed the greatest

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015
threat to the passage of health
care reform. Representative Bart
Stupak of Michigan had been in
office since 1993, placing him
among the senior leadership of
the so-called centrist Blue Dog
Democrats. When health care
reform was introduced in
Congress, Stupak became the
leader of an informal caucus of
anti-abortion Democrats, making
him the de facto swing vote on
the House version of the bill. By
extension, Stupak was the point
man in the campaign to ensure
that the bill would not allow
federal funding for abortion for
low-income women.
But after close consultation with
leaders of the U.S. Conference of
Catholic Bishops, Stupak went a
step further. He introduced a
draconian amendment to block
women from paying for abortions
from even their own private
insurance plans. The amendment,
which passed the House but was
shut down in the Senate, became
a key sticking point in health care
negotiations. 'He's a big hero
now in the pro-life community,"
former Bush Catholic issues
adviser Deal Hudson told me in
November 2009. "Thanks to him,
this is the first time I can
remember the pro-life Democrats
having any power."
To the chagrin of the
Republicans, Stupak entertained
offers of compromise from the
Democratic leadership.
According to Hudson, the
Catholic Bishops were keen to
see health care reform pass, but
only if the bill contained a clear
provision forbidding patients
from spending federal money on
abortion. Finally, in March, after
pressure from House Majority
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770985 Date: 08/31/2015
Leader Nancy Pelosi, Obam.a
agreed to sign an executive order
forbidding the federal funding of
abortion. Stupak had been
mollified. Now he and his anti-
abortion caucus pledged to
deliver the swing votes the
Democrats needed to pass the
bill. As soon as reports seeped out
declaring the imminent passage
of health care reform, major
right-wing blogs like
RedState.org churned out virulent
denunciations of Stupak, calling
him a traitor and sellout. The blog
comment sections filled up with
dozens of diatribes referring to
Stupak in language previously
reserved for Dr. George Tiller:
"Bart the Baby-Killer."
On March 20, thousands of Tea
Party activists surrounded the
Capitol's Longworth Building in
expectation of Obama's pep talk
to the House Democrats and the
health care vote. Democratic
Representative john Lewis, a
hero of the civil rights movement,
and Representative Barney Frank,
the first openly gay member of
Congress, passed through the
crowd on their way inside the
Capitol. Thsligger!" a demonstrator
barked at Lewis. Another called
Frank a "faggot," eliciting
laughter and cheers from nearby
protesters. Meanwhile, as another
African-American Democrat,
Representative Emanuel Cleaver,
ascended the Capitol steps, a
protester who had been screaming
at Lewis and Frank spat on his
face.
With the demonstration carried
on into the night, cries of "Kill
the bill!'' drifted into calls for
violence. "I would gladly stand
with any of you men here and
take these fascists down," a man

in camouflage battle dress
uniform proclaimed in front of an
amateur videographer, pointing
toward the Capitol. "You haven't
heard the last of me!"
The next day, Republican
members of Congress emerged
from the Longworth Building to
salute the Tea Partiers. The
demonstrators cheered wildly for
their proxies on the inside.
Finally, after hours of
impassioned speeches on the
House floor, the bill passed. But
the drama was hardly over.
Republican Representative Joe
Pitts, an anti-abortion Catholic
who co-authored Stupak's
original amendment, demanded a
motion to bring it back to the
floor for a vote, a transparent
exercise in grandstanding that
was certain to fail. In response,
Stupak rushed to the podium with
a stinging rebuke to Pitts and the
Republicans. "The motion to
commit does not support life,"
Stupak declared. "It is the
Democrats who have stood up...."
Heckling from the Republican
side interrupted his statement. As
Stupak looked around the House
chamber, Rep. Randy
Neugebauer, a right-wing
Republican from Texas who
openly supported the Birther
movement, began shouting at him
from the backbench, "Baby
killer!" Other Republicans joined
in, parroting base insults.
While the Republicans sank their
heads in defeat, some more
militant devotees of the Tea Party
movement called for a right-wing
Kristallnacht. "If you wish to
send a message that Pelosi and
her party cannot fail to hear,
break their windows,"

Vanderboegh of the Oathkeepers
wrote on a far-right blog hours
after the bill passed. "Break them
NOW. Break them and run to
break again." Within three days,
windows and doors at Democratic
Party headquarters in New York,
Kansas and Arizona had been
shattered.
Meanwhile, at least 10
Democratic members of Congress
reported receiving death threats.
Images of nooses were faxed to
the offices of Stupak and James
Clyburn, an African-American
congressman from South
Carolina. Representative Anthony
Weiner, an especially vocal
proponent of health care reform,
received a menacing letter filled
with white powder. The brother
of Representative Torn Perriello,
another health care supporter, had
his home gas line deliberately
sabotaged after a local Tea Party
organizer posted his address
online (he had meant to post the
congressman's) and encouraged
activists to "drop by" to express
their anger about Perriello's
recent vote. In Tucson, Arizona,
the windows of Democratic
Representative Gabrielle
Giffbrds' office were shattered by
shots from a pellet gun. And a
brick was thrown through the
window of Representative Louise
Slaughter's office in New York as
her voicemail filled with threats
of impending sniper attacks.
After the Passage of the health
care bill, the Tea Party floated
into a gray zone between

simply do an op-ed. Sid
Does Thomas Friedman Have to Talk to "Senior Economic Policy Makers" to Get So
Many Things Wrong?
Dean Baker is co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, DC.
Wednesday, 18 August 2010 04:04
Thomas Friedman begins his oiece 1Q(44v by telling readers that: "over the past few weeks I've had a chance to
speak with senior economic policy makers in America and Germany." This might lead readers to believe that
he is about to share some great insights that would only be possible for someone with special access to these
senior economic policy makers.
Readers with this expectation will be seriously disappointed. There is nothing here that is more insightful than
what can be found on the Washington Post's editorial pages on an average workday. Friedman rehashes the
usual cliches, with the usual lack of thought. In doing so, he gets both the story of the recent past and the
present seriously wrong.
Starting with the past, he badly misrepresents the prior business cycle:
"we've just ended more than a decade of debt-fueled growth during which we borrowed money from China to
give ourselves a tax cut and more entitlements but did nothing to curtail spending or make long-term
investments in new growth engines."
The main problem facing the U.S. economy of the last decade was a lack of demand. This was in large part due
to the fact that China lent to us. China's lending was its policy of propping up the value of the dollar in order to
maintain its export market in the United States. (At the start of the decade, the Clinton administration had also
tried to promote an over-valued dollar.) The over-valued -U.S. dollar made imports from China and other
countries very cheap in the United States and made our exports expensive in other countries. This led to a large
and growing trade deficit over most of the business cycle. The trade deficit replaced domestic demand,
preventing the economy from approaching normal levels of employment (even with the boost from the housing
bubble) until just before the crash.
There is no reason whatsoever to believe that China's decision to prop up the dollar was in any way affected by
the Bush tax cuts. In other words, neither the Bush tax cuts nor the growth in entitlements had anything to do
with our borrowing from China. The issue was China's decision to lend and thereby prop up the dollar. Given
the weakness of demand through most of the decade, these expenses could have been easily filled by domestic
production without borrowing from abroad.
Friedman does no better when he shifts the discussion from the past to the present. He refers to businesses'
reluctance to hire as the result of "unusual uncertainty," a phrase attributed to Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Ben Bemanke. Of course there is no reluctance to hire, there is simply a lack of demand for labor. A reluctance
to hire would be reflected in an increasing number of hours per worker, as employers sought to meet their
demand for labor by working the existing workforce more hours.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771122 Date: 08/31/2015
This is not happening. There is a modest uptick in hours from the low point of the downturn, but the increase
in hours per worker is certainly no more rapid than in other recessions and the average workweek is still far
shorter in just about every sector than it was before the downturn.
Later he tells readers:
"America's solvency inflection point is coinciding with a technological one. Thanks to Internet diffusion, the
rise of cloud computing, social networking and the shift from laptops and desktops to hand-held iPads and
iF'hones, technology is destroying older, less skilled jobs that paid a decent wage at a faster pace than ever
while spinning off more new skilled jobs that pay a decent wage but require more education than ever."
This is a great story -- social networking is soaring, IPads are everywhere -- does Friedman have any evidence
whatsoever that this development has increased the demand for educated workers and reduced the demand for
less educated workers? If so, this would be the place in his column to present the evidence. Otherwise, readers
might think that the 4.7 percent unemployment rate for college grads (nearly triple the pre-recession level),
coupled with a decline in their real wages over the decade, implies a reduced demand for the labor of highly
educated workers as well as less educated workers.
Friedman's proposed fix also seems a bit wide of the mark. He insists:
"There is only one way to deal with this challenge: more innovation to stimulate new industries and jobs that
can pay workers $40 an hour, coupled with a huge initiative to train more Americans to win these jobs over
their global competitors. There is no other way."
We better hope there is another way. A wage of $40 an hour would put a worker well over the 90th percentile
on the wage distribution. Even if we double the number of jobs in this pay range -- an incredible
accomplishment -- what happens to the other 80 percent of the workforce?
Friedman then warns us of the challenge from Europe by getting Germany's past and present wrong:
"Keeping up with Germany won't be easy. A decade ago Germany was the 'sick man of Europe.' No more. The
Germans pulled together. Labor gave up wage hikes and allowed businesses to improve competitiveness and
worker flexibility, while the government subsidized firms to keep skilled workers on the job in the downturn."
Germany clearly has done sorne changes that benefited its economy, like work sharing, and some that haven't,
but its past as the "sick man of Europe" is an invention of Friedman or his highly placed sources. Germany
always ran a trade surplus. That is the most basic measure of a country's competitiveness: foreigners are buying
its goods. Germany's unemployment rate in 2.000 ayeravd 7
.,5_percept, not hugely different than its current 7.0
percent rate.
The story here is that Friedman seems to have completely missed the basics of the current economic crisis in
spite of his weeks of conversing with senior economic policy makers. The current crisis is due to a lack of
demand pure and simple. If we generate demand either through more expansionary Fed monetary policy,
greater fiscal stimulus, or increased exports due to a falling dollar, there is no reason to believe that the
economy will not return to high levels of employment. Certainly Friedman has presented no evidence that
increased demand will not generate increased employment as it always has.
The longer term debt problem is overwhelmingly a health care story. Apparently Mr. Friedman's sources don't
have access to documents like the Medicare trustees report, which imply that U.S. health care costs will be
controlled and there will be no serious long-term deficit problem. This may prove -Wrong, but it seems that it
would have at least been worth noting in his column. Of course, if we have not fixed our health care system,
we can always achieve huge saving by retyinq on the more efficient health care systems in other countries.
If Friedman's intention was to scare us, he succeeded. After all, if senior economic policy makers in the U.S.
and Germany are as badly misinformed as Friedman implies, then we can expect some very had times ahead.

The military and the mullahs
William Dalrymple
Published 23 August 2010
The Pakistani state has a long history of nurturing jihadis as a means of dominating Afghanistan and undermining India.
It is proving a fatal alliance.
It May have been a nightmarish year for Pakistan but it has been a pretty good one for the country's inscrutable chief of
army staff, the most powerful man in the Land of the Pure, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani.
For a start, the army's response to the floods has compared well to the usual corrupt incompetence of Pakistan's civilian
politicians, guided by their chateau-hopping president, Asif Ali Zardari (while minister for investment, he was nicknamed
"Mr 10 Per Cent"; he has now been upgraded to "Mr 110 Per Cent"). This has led to discussion in army circles about
whether it is time to drop the civilian fig leaf and return the country to the loving embrace of its military. So serious is this
threat, that one of the country's most senior and well-connected journalists. Najam Sethi, editor-in-chief of the Friday
Times, went on the record this month to warn that elements in the army were plotting yet another coup."( know this is
definitely being discussed," he said.
Then there was the news that Kayani was going to be allowed to keep his job for a second term: "an extraordinary
situation requires an extraordinary decision to overcome it", explained a brigadier, writing in the Nation newspaper.
Kayani, a former head of Pakistan's notorious intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISO, can now continue
to run the army, and by default Pakistan's foreign policy, until November 2013.
But Kayani's biggest triumph this year, arguably the greatest of his career, was his visit to Kabul in July as the honoured
guest of the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai. The visit marked an important thawing in Pak-Afghan relations, which
have been glacial ever since Karzai came to power in 2001. It also coincided with the sacking of Amrullah Saleh,
Karzai's pro-Indian and rabidly anti-ISI former security chief. Saleh is a tough Tajik who rose to prominence as a
mujahedin protege of Ahmed Shah Massoud, the Indian-backed "Lion of Panjshir". The Taliban, and their sponsors in
the ISI, had regarded Saleh as their fiercest opponent, something Saleh was enormously proud of.
When I had dinner with him in Kabul in May, he spoke at length of his frustration with the ineffectiveness of Karzai's
government in taking the fight to the Taliban, and the extent to which the ISI was managing to aid, arm and train its
puppet insurgents in North Waziristan and Balochistan. Saleh's sacking gave notice of an important change of direction
by Karzai. As Bruce Riedel, Barack Obama's Af-Pak adviser, said when the news broke, "it means that Karzai is already
planning for a post-American Afghanistan". •
It seems that Kayani and Karzai are discussing some sort of accommodation between the Afghan government and ISI-
sponsored elements in the Taliban, maybe those of Sirajuddin Haqqani, which could give over much of the Pashtun
south to pro-Pakistan Taliban, but preserve Karzai in power in Kabul after the US withdrawal. The expulsion of India,
Pakistan's great regional rival, from Afghanistan, or at least the closing of its four regional consulates, would be a top
priority for the ISI in return for any deal that kept Karzai in power.
With the US toppling of the Taliban after the 11 September 2001 attacks, Pakistan's influence disappeared abruptly from
Afghanistan and
India quickly filled the vacuum. To the ISI's horror, in the early years of this decade, India provided reconstruction
assistance and training worth roughly £835m in total. It also built roads, sanitation projects, the new Afghan parliament
and free medical facilities across the country. It even offered to help train the Afghan army. Nato refused. As General

Stanley McChrystal put it in a report last year, "while Indian activities largely benefit the Afghan people, increasing Indian
influence in Afghanistan is likely to exacerbate regional tensions and encourage Pakistani countermeasures".
McChrystal was right. The Pakistanis have always been paranoid about the small Indian presence in Afghanistan. "We
have strong evidence [that India is] using Afghanistan against Pakistan's interests to destabilise Pakistan," a foreign
ministry spokesman claimed in March. Pakistan's military establishment, terrified of the economic superpower emerging
to the south, believes it would be suicide to accept an Indian presence in what it regards as its Afghan backyard - a
potential point of retreat for the army in the event of an Indian invasion, something Pakistani analysts refer to as vital
"strategic depth".
According to Indian diplomatic sources, there are still fewer than 3,600 Indians in Afghanistan; there are only ten Indian
diplomatic officers, as opposed to nearly 150 in the UK embassy. Yet the horror of being encircled has led the ISI to risk
Pakistan's relationship with its main strategic ally, the US, in order to keep the Taliban in play and its leadership under
ISI patronage in Quetta - a policy Kayani developed while head of the IS!. Karzai's new deal with the Pakistanis, and his
clear intention to try to reach some accommodation with their proxies among the Taliban, therefore represents a major
strategic victory for Kayani and Pakistan's military, as well as a grave diplomatic defeat for India.
Pakistan's support for the Taliban today is only the most recent chapter of an old story of complicity between jihadi
movements and the Pakistani state. Since the days of the anti-Soviet mujahedin, Pakistan's army saw violent Islamic
groups as an ingenious and cost-effective means of both dominating Afghanistan (which they finally achieved with the
retreat of the Soviets in 1987) and bogging down the Hindu-dominated Indian army in Kashmir (which they managed
with great effect from 1990 onwards).
The former ISI director and Dick Dastardly lookalike Hamid Gul, who was largely responsible for developing the strategy,
once said to me: "If the jihadis go out and contain India, tying down one rnillion men of their army on their own soil, for a
legitimate cause, why should we not support them?" Next to Gul in his Islamabad living room lay a piece of the Berlin
Wall presented to him by the city's people for "delivering the first blow" to the Soviet empire through his use of jihadis in
the 1980s. The WikiLeaks documents suggest he is still busy liaising with jihadis in his "retirement".
The Pakistani military top brass were long convinced that they could control the militants they have nurtured. In a taped
conversation between President Pervez Musharraf and Muhammad Aziz Khan, his chief of general staff, that India
released in 1999, Aziz said the army had the jihadis by their "tooti" (balls). Yet the Islamists have increasingly followed
their own agendas, sending suicide bombers out against not just Pakistan's religious minorities and political leaders, but
even the IS! headquarters. Nonetheless, many in the army still believe the jihadis are a more practical defence against
Indian hegemony than nuclear weapons. For them, supporting Islamist groups is not an ideological or religious whim, so
much as a practical and patriotic imperative - a vital survival strategy for a Pakistani state.
The army and ISI continued this duplicitous and risky policy after 11 September 2001 despite Musharrafs public
promises to the contrary. The speed with which the US lost interest in Afghanistan after its invasion and embarked on
plans to invade Iraq convinced the Pakistani army that the Washington had no long-term commitment to Karzai's
regime. This led to the generals keeping the Taliban in reserve, to be used to reinstal a pro-Pakistani regime in Kabul
once the American gaze had turned elsewhere.
So it was that the .ISI gave refuge to the leadership of the Taliban after it fled from Afghanistan in 2001. Mullah
Mohammed Omar was kept in an IS! safehouse in Quetta; his militia was lodged in the sprawling suburb of
Pashtunabad. There, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar presided over the Taliban military committee and war chest.
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the leader of Hizb-e-lslami, was lured back from exile in Iran and allowed to operate freely
outside Peshawar, while Jalaluddin Haqqani, one of the most violent Taliban commanders, was given sanctuary in North
Waziristan. Other groups were despatched to safehouses in Balochistan.
By 2004, the US had filmed Pakistani army trucks delivering Taliban fighters at the Afghan border and recovering them
a few days later; wireless monitoring at the US base at Bagram picked up Taliban commanders arranging with Pakistani
army officers at the border for safe passage as they came in and out of Afghanistan. Western intelligence agencies
concluded that the ISI was running a full training programme for the Afghan Taliban, turning a blind eye as they raised
funds in the Gulf and allowing them to import materiel, mainly via Dubai. By 2005 the Taliban, with covert Pakistani
support, were launching a full-scale assault on Nato troops in Afghanistan and being given covering fire as they returned
to their bases in Pakistan.
At the same time, Taliban attacks on Indian interests in Afghanistan intensified, beginning the process of turning the
Afghan conflict, like that in Kashmir, into what it is today: an lndo-Pak proxy war. The Indian embassy in Kabul was twice
bombed - in July 2008 and October 2009 - as were two city-centre hotels thought to have been used by the Research
and Analysis Wing (Raw), the Indian intelligence agency. Seven Indian civilians and two Indian military officers died in
the blasts.
The degree to which the ISI has been controlling the Afghan Taliban has only just become clear, and not just in the
documents published by WikiLeaks. A report by Matt Waldman of the Carr Centre for Human Rights at Harvard, based
on interviews with ten former senior Taliban commanders, closely documents how the IS! "orchestrates, sustains and
strongly influences" the Taliban and shows how the !SI is even represented on the Taliban's supreme leadership
council, the Quetta Shura.
Meanwhile, in the Punjab, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, founder of Lashkar-e-Toiba, and the man believed to have been
behind the 2008 Bombay attacks, has been allowed to continue operating from Muridke, near Lahore. "The powerful
western world is terrorising Muslims," he told a conference in Islamabad this year. "We are being invaded, manipulated

and looted. We must fight the evil trio of America, Israel and India. Suicide missions are in accordance with Islam. In
fact, a suicide attack is the best form of jihad."
At the same time as Pursuing its policy of selectively using jihadis, Pakistan has appeased the US by giving generous
assistance to the CIA in arresting foreign Arab al-Qaeda personnel. A major assault was also launched against both the
militants who took over the Lal Masjid and the ultra-radical Pakistan Taliban who took over the Swat Valley and
announced their intention of turning the country into an Islamic Emirate. In the course of these operations and others in
the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, more than 1,500 Pakistani soldiers and policemen were killed; another 250,000
people were made homeless in the Pak army assault on Bajaur. The IS1 has even been prepared to arrest any members
of the Afghan Taliban who didn't follow orders. Hence the seizure in Karachi, in February, of the Taliban second-in-
command, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, along with aboutia dozen other senior Taliban whom the ISI regarded as
infringing on their hospitality by opening talks with the Karzai administration via the Saudis, without ISI clearance.
Yet, even though the Pakistani army has conducted major offensives in six of the tribal areas, the seventh, North
Waziristan, has been left alone, as it is home to the ISI's favourite proxies: Haqqani and Hekmatyar. Similarly, Pakistan's
foot-dragging response to the 2008 attacks on Bombay, and the lack of response to the attacks on minority faith groups
in Pakistan over the past few months, show that the Janus-faced policy remains in place. This summer, the chief
minister of the Punjab, Shahbaz Sharif, was quoted heatedly denying that there were any militant groups working in the
Pakistani Punjab, or that the Punjabi Taliban even existed. There are still, in the eyes of many in the Pakistani
establishment, good Taliban and bad Taliban, useful militants and expendable ones.
In their eyes, the ongoing defeat of Nato in Afghanistan, with US and British troops suffering record casualties last
month, is a vindication of its long-term strategy. Islamabad has succeeded in regaining influence in Afghanistan and
Delhi has been checked. But India will not take this lying down. Already the Indian press has reported attempts to -
resuscitate the Northern Alliance as a contingency against the Taliban's takeover of the south, and here India is working
in conjuction with Russia, Iran and the central Asian "stans". The Indian national security adviser, Shivshankar Menon,
was despatched to Afghanistan in March, and the foreign minister, S M Krishna, has visited Tehran. Post-American
Afghanistan is looking increasingly likely to be divided between the Tajik, Uzbek and Hazara north and the Pashtun
south, either formally, with a partition, or more likely, to slip into inter-ethnic civil war, with India supporting and arming
the north and Pakistan the south.
As diplomacy gathers pace, the Afghan Taliban, who already control over 70 per cent of the country. continue to
increase their power. The most worrying development has been the spread of Taliban units to the previously peaceful
north, where they have taken over pockets of Pathan settlement around Kunduz and Badakhshan. The death of the
British aid worker Karen Woo on 5 August was a direct result.
In Pakistan. too, jihadi activity is growing. Last year there were 87 suicide attacks across the country, killing roughly
3,000 people and the ISI this week stated that, for the first time in the nation's history, it regarded home-grown Islamic
militants to be a bigger threat to the integrity of the nation than India. Yet the army continues to obsess about India. In a
recent speech, Kayani emphasised that although the army knows the dangers of militancy, it was against Indian attacks
that he was principally focused. At a time when Pakistan's economy is in crisis, electricity supply increasingly erratic and
the educational system in complete breakdown, Kayani has secured a huge increase in the country's defence budget.
It is not a pretty picture: growing violence everywhere, increasing Indo-Pak tensions and a defeat for western interests in
the region. Worst of all, because the Pakistani army regards this as a major triumph, it is unlikely to change its policy any
time soon.

Obama was too cautious in fearful times
By Martin Wolf
Published: Au• ust 31 2010 22:48 j Last updated: August 31 2010 22:48
Suppose that the US presidential election of 1932 had, in fact, taken place in 1930, at an early stage in the Great
Depression. Suppose, too, that Franklin Delano Roosevelt had won then, though not by the landslide of 1932. How
different subsequent events might have been. The president might have watched helplessly as output and employment
collapsed. The decades of Democratic dominance might not have happened.
On such chances the wheel of history turns. But this time was different: the crisis brought Barack Obama to power close
to the beginning of the economic collapse. I (among others) then argued that policy needed to be hugely aggressive. Alas,
it was not. I noted on February 4 2009, at the beginning of the new presidency: "Instead of an overwhelming fiscal
stimulus, what is emerging is too small, too wasteful and too ill-focused." A week later, I asked: "Has Barack Obama's
presidency already failed? In normal times, this would be a ludicrous question. But these are not normal times. They are
times of great danger. Today, the new US administration can disown responsibility for its inheritance; tomorrow, it will own
it. Today, it can offer solutions; tomorrow it will have become the problem. Today, it is in control of events; tomorrow,
events will take control of it. Doing too little is now far riskier than doing too much." This was right.
The direction of policy was not wrong: policymakers — though not all economists — had learnt a great deal from the 1930s.
Sensible people knew that aggressive monetary and fiscal expansion was needed, together with reconstruction of the
financial sector.
But, as Larry Summers, Mr Obama's chief economic adviser, had said: "When markets overshoot, policymakers must
overshoot too". Unfortunately, the administration failed to follow his excellent advice. This has allowed opponents to claim
that policy has been ineffective when it has merely been inadequate.
In consequence, the administration has lost credibility with the public and the chances of a renewed fiscal expansion have
disappeared. With the Federal Reserve cautious, too, the likelihood of a lengthy period of weak growth and heavy
joblessness is high. So, too, are the chances of domestic and global political friction.
True, the idea that the policies adopted in the last few months of the Bush administration and the first months of this one
were far better than nothing is weirdly controversial in the US. A recent paper by Alan Blinder, former vice-chairman of the
Fed, and Mark Zandi of Moody's argues that such critics are wrong. They use a standard macro-economic model to
assess what would have happened without any intervention, without the financial interventions (including monetary policy)
and without the fiscal action. They conclude that the peak to trough decline in gross domestic product would have been
close to 12 per cent with no policy response, compared to an actual decline of just 4 per cent (see chart). Similarly, the
unemployment rate would have peaked at 16.5 per cent, instead of the actual 10 per cent. The bigger collapse would also

have meant a fiscal deficit of $2,600bn in fiscal year 2011. The outcome is also disastrous with the modest fiscal response
but no financial •olic res•onse. It is a little better the other way round.
The implication that the modest stimulus package of February 2009 — a mere 5.7 per cent of 2009 GDP, spread over
several years — made a positive contribution is supported by the analysis of the Congressional Budget Office: it argues
that in 2010, US GDP will be between 1.5 per cent and 4.1 per cent higher and the unemployment rate between 0.7 and
1.8 percentage points lower, as a result of the package.
Panglossians who believe the private economy is always in equilibrium, unless governments intervene, disagree. I wish
there were some way to run this experiment without hurting hundreds of millions of people. But I find the idea that allowing
the collapse of much of the financial system, avoiding unconventional monetary policy and struggling to close the fiscal
deficit would have been consistent with a more rapid and sustained recovery quite bizarre.
A fascinating perspective does come, however, from comparisons with what happened in other advanced countries. The
recession in US output (and so demand) has been relatively small, but the decline in employment has been exceptionally
large, as a result of an extraordinary surge in US productivity (see charts). This contrast between what would happen to
output and what would happen to employment was missed in the initial Congressional Budget Office analysis of the
stimulus.
Since the US was the epicentre of the financial crisis, the relatively small decline in output is remarkable. Moreover, since
fiscal and monetary stimuli bear directly on demand and output, not jobs, this is a policy success. At the same time, the
enthusiasm with which US managers laid off workers is also extraordinary. No doubt, some of this is due to the collapse in
construction. But some of it must be due to the ease with which US companies can lay off workers and the incentives for
managers to maintain profits in a downturn at the expense of jobs.
Debate is emerging on how much of the surge in unemployment is structural. My answer, from European experience, is
that one way to ensure it becomes structural is to let it linger. In the short run, the simplest way to prevent that from
happening is to expand demand and so output. Since there is huge slack in the labour market, not the slightest threat of
inflation — far more a risk of deflation — and no constraint from bond or foreign exchange markets on further monetary and
fiscal stimulus, these are the policies that have to be pursued. Yet, alas, the Fed seems to have decided to fall asleep and
the administration has lost the initiative.
So what is going to happen? I assume that, after the midterm elections, resurgent Republicans will offer new tax cuts and
ignore the fiscal deficits. They will pretend that this has nothing to do with any reviled stimulus, though it is much the same
thing — increasing fiscal deficits, thereby offsetting private frugality. That would put the administration on the spot. It would
have to choose between vetoing the tax cuts and accepting them, so allowing the Republicans to get the credit for their
"yacht and mansion-led" recovery. Any recovery is better than none. But it could have been much better than this. Those
who were cautious when they should have been bold will pay a big price.

H: Pat Lang's view of the resumed talks. Sid
."IsraePaestinialpeace talks expected to resume in Se4zitember" Washst
"The Middle East peace process resumed in May, after a hiatus of 19 months, but it stalled
again over the terms of moving from indirect talks, mediated by U.S. envoy George Mitchell,
to direct negotiations.
.israel insists it is ready for direct talks, provided there are no preconditions. The Palestinians
are ready provided there is a clear agenda. Israel says an agenda means preconditions.
Resolving the snag over terms is crucial, diplomats say." Washpost
The former NY Times reporter Judy Miller likes to address me as "gloomy gus" or some such
thing when I encounter her. Well, stand by for some more gloom.
The second Camp David talks failed because Dennis Ross and company placed the
Palestinian delegation in a position in which a "solution" was demanded and expected by the
Americans and Israelis on the basis of bargaining during the negotiations themselves.
This seemed reasonable at the time to the US and Israeli negotiators. After all, is this not
what one does? Should not the outcome be the product of the dialectic of argument and
persuasion?
Arabs generally think not. They tend to believe that negotiations are for the purpose of of
arranging the details of outcomes that are understood in advance of the conference itself. For
them, anything else is an attempt to win concessions through trickery.
"The Palestinians are ready provided there is a clear agenda. Israel says an agenda means
preconditions."
Hello! What kind of nonsense is this? Have we learned nothing?
And then, there is the "little" matter of the non-participation of Hamas. Does the Obama
Administration really think that this 600 pound gorilla can be ignored? Is this some sort of
scheme on the part of Natanyahu, and "the boys" to discredit Abbas so that an isolated
Hamas can be attacked and destroyed later?
Realism in diplomacy is a desirable thing. George Mitchell used to be smarter than this. His
staff should be advising him not to do this. Failure will be catastrophic.
All the players should be engaged, and they are not. The outcome should be known in
advance and it is not.
This is both childish and destructive. pl

To say that the American people are angry is an understatement. The political brain of Americans today reflects a volatile
mixture of fear and fury, and when you mix those together, you get an explosion. The only question at this point is how to
mitigate the damage when the bomb detonates in November.
The bad news is that it's too late for Democrats to do what would have been both good policy and good politics (and what
the House actually did do), namely to pass a major jobs bill when it was clear that the private sector couldn't keep
Americans employed. The "Obama Doctrine" should have been that Americans who want to work and have the ability to
contribute to our productivity as a nation should have the right to work, and that if the private sector can't meet the
demand for jobs, we have plenty of roads and bridges to fix, new energy sources to develop and manufacture, and
schools to build and renovate so our kids and workers returning for training can compete in the 21st century global
economy. From having spent much of the last four years testing messages on a range of issues, from immigration to
taxes and deficits, I can say with some certainty that nothing John Boehner or Eric Cantor could say could come within 30
points of generating the enthusiasm -- particularly among swing voters -- of a message that began, "We don't have a
shortage of work ethic in this country, we have a shortage of work." That message resonates across the political
spectrum. And it isn't even the strongest message we've tested in the last weeks or months that beats back the toughest
deficit-cutting language the other side can muster.
But it's too late for that. The administration opted for an alternative doctrine, which Larry Summers enunciated on This
Week several months ago: that unemployment is going to remain high for the foreseeable future and eventually come
down -- as if there's nothing we can do about it -- and that they will push here and there for small symbolic measures
whose symbolism tends to escape people who are out of work. It's hard to be excited by symbolism when your children

are hungry or the bank is repossessing your home -- although you didn't do anything to deserve it -- while the people who
did are once again making out like bandits.
Although the situation looks bleak for Democrats in November, it ain't over 'til it's over. Republicans are shooting
themselves in the foot all over the country, running Tea Party candidates who are so far to the right you can't see Middle
America from their porch. And some endangered Democrats will likely see victory in November from theirs if they
understand the public mood and speak to it.
What is that public mood? It can be characterized by a single phrase -- populist anger -- and it cuts across partisan lines.
On the right, it is alloyed with racial anxiety and prejudice. On the left, it is alloyed with tremendous disappointment at
what could have been if we had the kind of bold leadership for which times like these cry out. And among people in the
vast political center, populist anger is alloyed with anxiety and uncertainty -- about their jobs, their homes, and their
children's future.
How to Create a Populist Explosion: A Tragedy in Two Acts
So how did we get here? The story can be told as a tragedy in two acts.
Act I: The GOP Sets the Country on a Course of Economic Destruction and the President Calls for Truth and
Reconciliation without the Truth Part
• A strong economic downturn devolves into a Great Recession, as the stock market crashes and major banks fail.
By October 2008, upper middle class moderate Republicans in the suburbs are so frightened by what's happening
to their assets that they're willing to give Democrats a chance.
• A Republican administration that believes in neither government nor regulation creates a 700 billion bank bailout
with no accountability. Unlike Republicans, who would say "no" in a situation like this and let a Great Recession
turn into a Great Depression, Democrats do the right thing, but they don't make it clear from the start that these
are Bush Bailouts and remind Americans, over and over, that the cause of all the bankruptcies is the bankruptcy
of Republican ideology.
• A charismatic young president raises people's hopes and expectations, as he uniquely can. Americans are
frightened, but they are willing and waiting to hear an alternative narrative to "government is the problem, not the
solution" and a path back to economic recovery and security.
• The White House refuses to tell the American people three stories they desperately need to hear.
• The first is why the economy has gone into the ditch, and who did it. The president is steadfast in his position that
we should "look forward, not backward," even as the GOP is blocking his every initiative to clean up its mess. As
conservative attacks on him and Democrats increase, he refuses to indict the Republicans in Congress or
President Bush for having destroyed our economy and putting one in eight Americans out of work and one in five
either behind on their mortgage or in the process of having their homes foreclosed by the same bankers who
gambled them away. Why did he need to tell the American people who was responsible for their misery -- and to
repeat it again and again? Because otherwise, if the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression didn't
subside within a year and half, voters would start to associate it with him and his party. This is Neuroscience 101 -
- it's how mental associations are formed. But the president never even uttered George W. Bush's name in his
first year in office, and the first time he did mention Bush was to appoint him, along with former President Clinton,
to co-lead American relief efforts in Haiti. The president doesn't like putting antagonists in any of his stories, but if
forced to, he would cite unnamed "naysayers," "Washington politics as usual," or "Congress," which was
counterproductive given that Congress was held by his party. The guiding belief at the White House implicit in this
messaging strategy was that Americans have a good grasp on economics and good memories:
• The second story the American people needed to hear from the president was why deficit spending is essential
when the economy is spiraling downward. It's not a hard story to tell, even in a sound bite. But one of the best
educators to occupy the Oval Office in decades chose not to educate -- he actually did it once, with prodding, but
never repeated what was a superb explanation --- nor did he remind voters every time his opponents attacked
him for deficit spending that they had left him with a 1.2 trillion dollar deficit on the day he walked into office
because of their unpaid-for tax cuts to millionaires and unpaid-for war on Iraq that called on no one to sacrifice
except our soldiers and their families (and our kids and grandkids, who will be paying off this war for generations).
A year later, with Democrats on the ropes, the president started to tell that story. It was the right move, but
appeared defensive because it hadn't been part of his guiding narrative from the start.
• The third story the president needed to offer was an alternative narrative on government. The president and his
party were about to offer effective government as a solution to multiple problems after 30 years of solid branding
by conservatives since Ronald Reagan about how government is the problem. But the narrative never came.
• The White House and Democratic Congress pass what virtually all economists outside the Goldman Sachs-to-
Washington pipeline consider a half-stimulus that they predict will likely produce half-results. It fulfilled its promise.
But the equally predictable political result was a discrediting of the concept of government intervention to
stimulate the economy in the eyes of the public -- enough to scare off Democratic lawmakers from doing what
they learned about Keynesian economics in intro economics for the indefinite future. Instead of blasting the
Republicans for having hurled the country toward an abyss that would now take drastic measures to avert and
warning the American people that this could easily be the first of two or three trillion-dollar packages that might be

needed to get Americans back to work and to get the gears of the economy grinding again before we could start
returning to the kinds of surpluses Bill Clinton had left the last time a Democrat was in the White House, the
president chose to compromise with a party that was so unpopular when he took office that only 20 percent of
voters at that point would even admit to a pollster that they considered themselves Republicans -- the lowest point
for the GOP since the rise of public opinion polling 50 years earlier.
• The economy continues its free-fall, shedding 700,000 jobs a month. Meanwhile, Democrats don't take the kind of
dramatic steps necessary to stop the bleeding. Americans are becoming desperate, but they remain hopeful that
this new president will turn things around, and that perhaps the jobs provisions of the new "stimulus" act will do
cauterize the wound. Meanwhile, the stimulus is being portrayed by Republicans as a mixture of pork and fat, and
no one is effectively answering the charges, creating increasingly negative associations to an act that was never
adequately crafted or sold.
• The logical follow-up to a bill designed to pull the economy out of a ditch is to make such a bill unnecessary in the
future, by attacking Wall Street for having thrown us into crisis and passing strong legislation to rein in the
excesses that created the economic meltdown. This would have sealed the American people's loyalty to the new
president and Congress. (Heading into November, this is, in fact, the most popular piece of legislation the
Democrats have passed, but it took them nearly a year and a half to get there, and by then, neither the president
nor the Democratic Congress enjoyed the good will of the average American.) Instead, the same banks that
received bailouts are foreclosing in record rates on the homeowners whose payroll taxes funded the bailouts but
don't seem to get the same kind of attention to their needs from the federal government. Adding insult to injury,
the banks double and triple credit card interest rates to as high as 30 percent, including on people's existing credit
card debt -- while continuing to receive no-interest loans from the federal government.
• Despite talk of accountability, no one is fired (except one auto executive), virtually no one is prosecuted or even
investigated as far as anyone knows, and banks that received bailouts flaunt record bonuses.
Act II: An Anemic Economy Meets an Anemic Health Care Plan
• The public has been clamoring for health care reform. Over 40 million people don't have health insurance at all,
and the 85 percent of voters who do have health care have seen their costs double during the Bush years at the
same time as real income has declined. Effective narratives on health care are widely available that win by a 2:1
margin against the toughest Harry-and-Louise anti-reform language from the other side. The opposition knows it,
as evident in a leaked memo by Republican wordsmith Frank Luntz, who warns that this will be an uphill climb for
opponents of reform, who would do well to accept some major elements of it.
• But instead of using any of the well-tested narratives that were highly effective during the campaign or devising
any new ones of its own, the administration decides to try to "sell" health care without a narrative. (I wrote about
this in detail a year ago and will not repeat that history here, except in telegraphic form.) The president refuses to
state where he stands on any of the substantive debates about health reform for a year, such as whether we
should have a "public option" (a term so ill-conceived it's hard to believe the public supported it anyway; imagine
the support it might have received if it had been called instead "the one health care plan the health insurance
companies don't get to control"). Instead, the White House uses phrases such as "bending the cost curve" while
conservatives flood the airwaves with evocative phrases such as "government takeover," "a bureaucrat between
you and your doctor," and "death panels."
• Instead of using Big Pharma and the health insurance industry as the villains of the health care story, which would
explain why we need an overhaul rather than a Band-Aid, the White House once again offers a story without
protagonists or antagonists, and cuts secret deals with both industries that become public.
• Over interminable months of trying to get the votes of the same Republicans who fought against Medicare for
seniors for 30 years until the program was just too popular to keep attacking it and who are still trying to gut Social
Security despite its popularity, the public then watches what George Will describes as the "serial bribery" of
Republican and Democratic Senators alike, as each gets to take his or her turn as the 60th vote.
• At the 11th hour, as a compromise plan is finally going to pass, the president nixes the idea of a Medicare-like
alternative Americans can choose over a health-insurance industry plan if they so desire, despite 60 percent of
even swing voters wanting it included in the bill.
• Instead of being the signature bill that demonstrates both that Democrats can govern effectively and that
government can be a force for good for working and middle class Americans (who have just been told that the
better plans they've negotiated or been offered for years by their employers are "Cadillacs" that are going to be
taxed out of existence), the entire process proves to the average American that government can't do anything
right and scares moderate Democrats away from voting for any other bill that would ever put them on the record
supporting government or spending.
• "Government" hits an all-time low in the polls, matching the popularity of big corporations, CEOs, and bailouts.
• Populist anger emerges as the primary emotion across the political spectrum, and the president's job approval
with swing voters drops into the high thirties.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771198 Date: 08/31/2015
• Following the conventional wisdom, Democrats return to their all-too-familiar defensive crouch, and conclude that
when in trouble, tack right. On health care, the president and his Cabinet fan out all over television to "reassure"
the public on health care that abortion won't be covered (thanks for the reassurance, but most of us didn't find that
reassuring), that domestic partners won't be covered, and that immigrants won't be covered. None of these issues
needed to be conceded. (I know this because I tested messages on them, and well- messaged progressive
positions on them would have boosted the popularity of the bill with swing voters.)
• The White House starts adopting failed conservative policies and talking points that leave the public utterly
confused about where the president, and by extension, his party, stands on the central issues of the day. The
president talks about cutting deficits and increasing spending in the same breath, using the metaphor of families
tightening their belt in tough times, which only strengthens resolve against stimulating a faltering economy;
pledges support for massively expanding offshore drilling and "clean coal" (which doesn't exist, by the way) in a
speech on climate change; and sends in 1200 additional National Guards to Arizona as an apparent reward for
passing "No Latino Left Behind," while publicly objecting to the legislation.
• The underlying psychological assumption of these moves is that if you mix policies from the right and left in equal
parts, you win the center. In fact, no one has ever won the center that way. It appears weak, opportunistic, and
incoherent to the average swing voter, which is particularly problematic at a time when people in the center
desperately want to know that their leaders have a vision and a coherent plan for what to do (which is why both
FDR and Ronald Reagan were so effective in moving voters in the center). It doesn't win any votes on the right.
But it does have one predictable effect: It sucks the motivation out of your base, who feel demoralized and
betrayed (if they're part of the "professional left") or less likely to vote (if they're average voters who don't follow
politics carefully but just don't feel very enthusiastic anymore, even if they don't really know why).
• Capping it all off, the BP disaster occurs two weeks after the president has adopted the "drill here, drill now," "all
of the above" position of the Republican Party and the oil companies. This could have been the perfect
opportunity to go on the offensive, contrast what Democrats stand for (common sense, protection of our safety,
the land we leave our children, and key American industries and jobs, and sticking up for ordinary Americans
against big businesses and their lobbyists) with what Republicans stand for; and connect the dots between what
happened on Wall Street (with regulators owned and operated by the companies they were supposed to regulate)
and what happened in the Gulf (where precisely the same thing happened). Instead, the administration finds itself
on the defensive, increasingly sounding like a subsidiary of BP, allowing BP to call the shots and control
information for weeks, defending increasingly hard-to-believe statistics, and issuing press releases that appear
indistinguishable from those issued by BP but are inconsistent with assessments of independent scientists.
Where Do We Go from Here?
So that is where we find ourselves today: a Democratic Party and Democratic base that is demoralized and unlikely to
vote in high numbers in November; a Republican Party that is selling replanted Bushes with tremendous enthusiasm; and
a vast political center filled with voters who are utterly confused and unsure who to turn to but certain that things aren't
going well.
In January 2009 no one could have predicted that Democrats would be in this predicament today. Perhaps Democrats
might lose a few seats lost in an off-year election, but certainly no more than that. We had just seen -- and the American
public knew we had just seen -- the most disastrous performance by a president and party in living history, and the
American people had elected a tremendously charismatic young president with enormous Democratic majorities in both
houses of Congress. They had given the president and Congress a strong mandate for whatever kind of change was
necessary to get us out of economic free-fall and to put Americans back to work.
But there were red flags already by the end of Obama's first week in office that led me to offer the following advice to the
new administration: Tell the story of how we got in this mess or you'll own it. Tell a coherent story about deficit spending.
Re-brand government because there's only one story out there now (Reagan's), and it's not one that supports a
progressive agenda. Never let attacks go unanswered, because doing so only emboldens your opposition and leads the
public to believe that you have no answers to them. And if you throw a bipartisan party and no one comes, don't throw
another one. All of what followed has been as predictable as it has been unfortunate. A year and a half later, the White
House hasn't consistently done any of these things, although the President is now intermittently doing some of them, and
when he does, he does them well.
The question today is whether Democrats can channel the populist anger we are seeing around the country this late in the
game. The answer is that we'd better try. Having recently tested messages on economics and jobs, including how to talk
about deficits and taxes -- widely assumed to be Democrats' Achilles Heel, particularly now -- there is little question that if
Democrats and progressives from center to left simply say what they believe in ways that are evocative, values-driven,
and speak to people's worries and 'anger, many stand a good chance of surviving November, particularly when their
opponents have nothing to say other than warmed-over rhetoric about cutting taxes to millionaires and multinationals and
fiscal restraint except where it cuts into profits of their campaign contributors. Even the most evocative boilerplate
conservative messages fall flat against honest messages that speak to the need to get Americans working again. And on
issue after issue, no message is more resonant right now than one that sides with working and middle class Americans
and small business owners against special interests, big business, and their lobbyists.

But actions speak louder than words, and Americans want to see action. It may be too late for the kind of jobs bill we
should have seen a year and a half ago, but it isn't too late for Democrats to go on the offensive against the Republicans -
- virtually all of them -- who opposed extending unemployment insurance to millions of Americans who were thrown out of
work by the Republicans' corporate sponsors. It isn't too late for Democrats to contrast their support for the highly popular
aid to state and local governments that just saved the jobs of hundreds of thousands of teachers, firefighters, and police
all over the country with Republicans' desire to throw them out onto the street. It isn't too late to make a voting issue out of
the bill the Republicans are stalling that would give small businesses a fighting chance in an economy stacked against
them, and to make clear that one party stands for small businesses, which create 75 percent of the new jobs in this
country, and the other party stands for big businesses that outsource American jobs and offshore their profits to avoid
paying their fair share of American taxes. It's not too late to pass a bill that would limit credit card interest rates to a
reasonable percent above the rate at which credit is made available to credit card companies. It's not too late to pass the
first badly need "fix" to the health care reform act to demonstrate to Americans that Democrats mean it when they say this
was just the first step, namely a law that stops insurance companies from increasing their premiums by 40 percent while
cutting the size of their networks by 50-75 percent, which violates the principles of affordability and choice that were so
essential to efforts to sell health care reform to the public. It's not too late to vow to change the rules of the Senate to
prevent the use of the filibuster to give every special interest veto power over every important piece of legislation. It's not
too late to introduce legislation that's been on hold in both the House and Senate to guarantee fair elections, so that the
voice of everyday Americans is heard over the voice of the special interests that finance political campaigns.
On every one of these issues, a strong populist message trounces anything the other side can say. But Democrats need
to play offense. They need to take up-or-down votes on bill after bill, including those they expect the other side to block,
knowing that every one of those votes has the leverage of a campaign ad behind it. They need to change the narrative
from what sounds to the average American like a whiny and impotent one -- "the Republicans won't let us do it" -- to a
narrative of strength in numbers shared with their constituents. And they need to make every election a choice between
two well-articulated approaches to governance -- and to offer their articulation of both sides' positions and values.
That leads to a final point. What Democrats have needed to offer the American people is a clear narrative about what and
who led our country to the mess in which we find ourselves today and a clear vision of what and who will lead us out. That
narrative would have laid a roadmap for our elected officials and voters alike, rather than making each legislative issue a
seemingly discrete turn onto a dirt road. That narrative might have included -- and should include today -- some key
elements: that if the economy is tumbling, it's the role of leadership and government to stop the free-fall; that if Wall Street
is gambling with our financial security, our homes, and our jobs, true leaders do not sit back helplessly and wax eloquent
aboUt the free market, they take away the dice; that if the private sector can't create jobs for people who want to work,
then we'll put Americans back to work rebuilding our roads, bridges, and schools; that if Big Oil is preventing us from
competing with China's wind and solar energy programs, then we'll eliminate the tax breaks that lead to dysfunctional
investments in 19th century fuels and have a public-private partnership with companies that will create the clean, safe
fuels of the 21st century and the millions of good American jobs that will follow.
That's what Democrats stand for. It's time they said it.

Dear Hillary,
Next Sunday (October 17th) Valerie and I arrive in DC for a week of screenings of Fair Game, the film of
our fight with the Bush administration. I plan to be in DC through the following Thursday. There are
screenings in Silver Spring on Tuesday at the American Film Institute festival and on Wednesday in
Georgetown as a benefit for the Treatment Action Group, an HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment
organization. You, Potus (ret) and whomever you would like to bring are invited to either or
both. Alternatively, I would be pleased to arrange a private screening for you and your guests either at
your home or elsewhere. Depending on the time, either Valerie or I would be delighted to attend and
answer questions afterwards.
If these dates do not work for you, I am also happy to ensure that a screening is arranged whenever is
convenient.
Valerie and I think that the film tells the story of that time and are proud of it. I would be pleased to
share it with you.
With warmest regards. Joe

America's Faltering Search for Peace in the Middle East: Openings for Others?
Remarks to staff of the Royal Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs
and, separately, to members of the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs
Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.)
1 September 2010, Oslo, Norway
You have asked me to speak to current American policies in the Middle East, with an emphasis on the prospects for
peace in the Holy Land. You have further suggested that I touch on the relationship of the Gulf Arabs, especially Saudi
Arabia, to this. It is both an honor and a challenge to address this subject in this capital / at this ministry.
The declaration of principles worked out in Oslo seventeen years ago was the last direct negotiation between Israelis and
Palestinian Arabs to reach consequential, positive results. The Oslo accords were a real step toward peace, not another
deceptive pseudo-event in an endlessly unproductive, so-called "peace process." And if that one step forward in Oslo in
1993 was followed by several steps backwards, there is a great deal to be learned from how and why that happened.
There can be no doubt about the importance of today's topic. The ongoing conflict in the Holy Land increasingly disturbs
the world's conscience as well as its tranquility. The Israel-Palestine issue began as a struggle in the context of European
colonialism. In the post-colonial era, tension between Israelis and the Palestinians they dispossessed became, by
degrees, the principal source of radicalization and instability in the Arab East and then the Arab world as a whole. It
stimulated escalating terrorism against Israelis at home and their allies abroad. Since the end of the Cold War, the
interaction between Israel and its captive Palestinian population has emerged as the fountainhead of global strife. It is
increasingly difficult to distinguish this strife from a war of religions or a conflict of civilizations.
For better or ill, my own country, the United States has played and continues to play the key international part in this
contest. American policies, more than those of any other external actor, have the capacity to stoke or stifle the hatreds in
the Middle East and to spread or reverse their infection of the wider world. American policies and actions in the Middle
East thus affect much more than that region.
Yet, as I will argue, the United States has been obsessed with process rather than substance. It has failed to involve
parties who are essential to peace. It has acted on Israel's behalf to preempt rather than enlist international and regional
support for peace. It has defined the issues in ways that preclude rather than promote progress. Its concept of a "peace
process" has therefore become the handmaiden of Israeli expansionism rather than a driver for peace. There are
alternatives to tomorrow's diplomatic peace pageant on the Potomac. And, as Norway has shown, there is a role for
powers other than America in crafting peace in the Holy Land.

Over thirty years ago, at Camp David, Jimmy Carter pushed Israel through the door to peace that Egypt's Anwar Sadat
had opened. Twenty years ago, the first Bush administration pressed Israel to the negotiating table with Palestinian
leaders, setting the stage for their clandestine meetings in Oslo. The capacity of the United States to rally other
governments behind a cause that it espouses may have atrophied, but American power remains far greater than that of
any other nation. Nowhere is this more evident than in the Middle East.
For more than four decades, Israel has been able to rely on aid from the United States to dominate its region militarily and
to sustain its economic prosperity. It has counted on its leverage in American politics to block the application of
international law and to protect itself from the political repercussions of its policies and actions. Unquestioning American
support has enabled Israel to put the seizure of ever more land ahead of the achievement of a modus vivendi with the
Palestinians or other Arabs. Neither violent resistance from the dispossessed nor objections from abroad have brought
successive Israeli governments to question, let alone alter the priority they assign to land over peace.
Ironically, Palestinians too have developed a dependency relationship with America. This has locked them into a political
framework over which Israel exercises decisive influence. They have been powerless to end occupation, pogroms, ethnic
cleansing, and other humiliations by Jewish soldiers and settlers. Nor have they been able to prevent their progressive
confinement in checkpoint-encircled ghettos on the West Bank and the great open-air prison of Gaza.
Despite this appalling record of failure, the American monopoly on the management of the search for peace in Palestine
remains unchallenged. Since the end of the Cold War, Russia — once a contender for countervailing influence in the
region — has lapsed into impotence. The former colonial powers of the European Union, having earlier laid the basis for
conflict in the region, have largely sat on their hands while ringing them, content to let America take the lead. China,
India, and other Asian powers have prudently kept their political and military distance. In the region itself, Iran has
postured and exploited the Palestinian cause without doing anything to advance it. Until recently, Turkey remained aloof.
On rare occasions, as in the case of the 1973 Arab oil embargo, the Arabs have backed their verbal opposition to Israel
with action. Egypt and Jordan have settled into an unpopular coexistence with Israel that is now sustained only by U.S.
subventions. Saudi Arabia has twice taken the initiative to offer Israel diplomatic concessions if it were to conclude
arrangements for peaceful coexistence with the Palestinians. But, overall, Arab governments have earned the contempt
of the Palestinians and their own people for their lack of serious engagement. For the most part, Arab leaders have
timorously demanded that America solve the Israel-Palestine problem for them, while obsequiously courting American
protection against Israel, each other, Iran, and — in some cases — their own increasingly frustrated and angry subjects and
citizens.
Islam charges rulers with the duty to defend the faithful and to uphold justice. It demands that they embody
righteousness. The resentment of mostly Muslim Arabs at their governing elites' failure to meet these standards
generates sympathy for terrorism directed not just at Israel but at both the United States and Arab governments
associated with it.
The perpetrators of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on the United States saw it in part as reprisal for American
complicity in Israeli cruelties to Palestinians and other Arabs. They justified it as a strike against Washington's protection
of Arab governments willing to overlook American contributions to Muslim suffering. Washington's response to the attack
included suspending its efforts to make peace in the Holy Land as well as invading and occupying Afghanistan and
Iraq. All three actions inadvertently strengthened the terrorist case for further attacks on America and its allies. The
armed struggle between Americans and Muslim radicals has already spilled over to Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, and other

countries. Authoritative voices in Israel now call for adding Iran to the list of countries at war with America. They are
echoed by Zionist and neo-conservative spokesmen in the United States,
The widening involvement of Americans in combat in Muslim lands has inflamed anti-American passions and catalyzed a
metastasis of terrorism. It has caused a growing majority of the world's 1.6 billion Muslims to see the United States as a
menace to their faith, their way of life, their homelands, and their personal security. American populists and European
xenophobes have meanwhile undercut liberal and centrist Muslim arguments against the intolerance that empowers
terrorism by equating terrorism and its extremist advocates with Islam and its followers. The current outburst of bigoted
demagoguery over the construction of an Islamic cultural center and mosque in New York is merely the most recent
illustration of this. It suggests that the blatant racism and Islamophobia of contemporary Israeli politics is contagious. It
rules out the global alliances against religious extremists that are essential to encompass their political defeat.
President Obama's inability to break this pattern must be an enormous personal disappointment to him. He came into
office committed to crafting a new relationship with the Arab and Muslim worlds. His first interview with the international
media was with Arab satellite television. He reached out publicly and privately to Iran. He addressed the Turkish
parliament with persuasive empathy. He traveled to a great center of Islamic learning in Cairo to deliver a remarkably
eloquent message of conciliation to Muslims everywhere. He made it clear that he understood the centrality of injustices
in the Holy Land to Muslim estrangement from the West. He promised a responsible withdrawal from Iraq and a judicious
recrafting of strategy in Afghanistan. Few doubt Mr. Obama's sincerity. Yet none of his initiatives has led to policy
change anyone can detect, let alone believe in
It is not for me to analyze or explain the wide gaps between rhetoric and achievement in the Obama Administration's
stewardship of so many aspects of my country's affairs. American voters will render their first formal verdict on this two
months from tomorrow, on the 2nd of November. The situation in the Holy Land, Iraq, Afghanistan, and adjacent areas is
only part of what they will consider as they do so. But I do think it worthwhile briefly to examine some of the changes in
the situation that ensure that many policies that once helped us to get by in the Middle East will no longer do this.
Let me begin with the "peace process," a hardy perennial of America's diplomatic repertoire that the Obama
Administration will put back on public display tomorrow. In the Cold War, the appearance of an earnest and "even-
handed" American search for peace in the Holy Land was the price of U.S. access and influence in the Middle East. It
provided political cover for conservative Arab governments to set aside their anger at American backing of Israel so as to
stand with America and the Western bloc against Soviet Communism. It kept American relations with Israel and the
Arabs from becoming a zero-sum game. It mobilized domestic Jewish support for incumbent presidents. Of course, there
hasn't been an American-led "peace process" in the Middle East for at least a decade. Still the conceit of a "peace
process" became an essential political convenience for all concerned. No one could bear to admit that the "peace
process" had expired. It therefore lived on in phantom form.
Even when there was no "peace process," the possibility of resurrecting one provided hope to the gullible, cover to the
guileful, beguilement for the press, an excuse for doing nothing to those gaining from the status quo, and — last but far
from least — lifetime employment for career "peace processors." The perpetual processing of peace without the
requirement to produce it has been especially appreciated by Israeli leaders. It has enabled them to behave like
magicians, riveting foreign attention on meaningless distractions as they systematically removed Palestinians from their
homes, settled half a million or more Jews in newly vacated areas of the occupied territories, and annexed a widening
swath of land to a Jerusalem they insist belongs only to Israel.

Palestinian leaders with legitimacy problems have also had reason to collaborate in the search for a "peace process." It's
not just that there has been no obviously better way to end their people's suffering. Playing "peace process" charades
justifies the international patronage and Israeli backing these leaders need to retain their status in the occupied
territories. It ensures that they have media access and high-level visiting rights in Washington. Meanwhile, for American
leaders, engagement in some sort of Middle East "peace process" has been essential to credibility in the Arab and Islamic
worlds, as well as with the ever-generous American Jewish community. Polls show that most American Jews are
impatient for peace. Despite all the evidence to the contrary, they are eager to believe in the willingness of the
government of Israel to trade land for it.
Previous "peace processes" have exploited all these impulses. In practice, however, these diplomatic distractions have
served to obscure Israeli actions and evasions that were more often prejudicial to peace than helpful in achieving
it. Behind all the blather, the rumble of bulldozers has never stopped. Given this history, it has taken a year and a half of
relentless effort by U.S. Special Envoy George Mitchell to persuade the parties even to meet directly to talk about talks as
they first did here in Oslo, seventeen years ago. When the curtain goes up on the diplomatic show in Washington
tomorrow, will the players put on a different skit? There are many reasons to doubt that they will.
One is that the Obama administration has engaged the same aging impresarios who staged all the previously failed
"peace processes" to produce and direct this one with no agreed script. The last time these guys staged such an ill-
prepared meeting, at Camp David in 2000, it cost both heads of delegation, Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat, their political
authority. It led not to peace but to escalating violence. The parties are showing up this time to minimize President
Obama's political embarrassment in advance of midterm elections in the United States, not to address his agenda — still
less to address each other's agendas. These are indeed difficulties. But the problems with this latest — and possibly final
— iteration of the perpetually ineffectual "peace process" are more fundamental.
The Likud Party charter flatly rejects the establishment of a Palestinian Arab state west of the Jordan River and stipulates
that: "The Palestinians can run their lives freely in the framework of self-rule, but not as an independent and sovereign
state." This Israeli government is committed to that charter as well as to the Jewish holy war for land in Palestine. It has
no interest in trading land it covets for a peace that might thwart further territorial expansion. It considers itself unbound
by the applicable UN resolutions, agreements from past peace talks, the "Roadmap," or the premise of the "two-state
solution."
The Palestinians are desperate for the dignity and security that only the end of the Israeli occupation can provide. But the
authority of Palestinian negotiators to negotiate rests on their recognition by Israel and the United States, not on their
standing in the occupied territories, Gaza, or the Palestinian diaspora. Fatah is the ruling faction in part of Palestine. Its
authority to govern was repudiated by voters in the last Palestinian elections. The Mahmoud Abbas administration retains
power by grace of the Israeli occupation authorities and the United States, which prefer it to the government empowered
by the Palestinian people at the polls. Mr. Abbas's constitutional term of office has long since expired. He presides over
a parliament whose most influential members are locked up in Israeli jails. It is not clear for whom he, his faction, or his
administration can now speak.
So the talks that begin tomorrow promise to be a case of the disinterested going through the motions of negotiating with
the mandate-less. The parties to these talks seek to mollify an America that has severely lessened international
credibility. The United States government had to borrow the modest reputations for objectivity of others — the EU, Russia,
and the UN — to be able to convene this discussion. It will be held under the auspices of an American president who was

publicly humiliated by Israel's prime minister on the issue that is at the center of the Israel-Palestine dispute — Israel's
continuing seizure and colonization of Arab land.
Vague promises of a Palestinian state within a year now waft through the air. But the "peace process" has always
sneered at deadlines, even much, much firmer ones. A more definitive promise of an independent Palestine within a year
was made at Annapolis three years ago. Analogous promises of Palestinian self-determination have preceded or resulted
from previous meetings over the decades, beginning with the Camp David accords of 1979. Many in this audience will
recall the five-year deadline fixed at Oslo. The talks about talks that begin tomorrow can yield concrete results only if the
international community is prepared this time to insist on the one-year deadline put forward for recognizing a Palestinian
state. Even then there will be no peace unless long-neglected issues are addressed.
Peace is a pattern of stability acceptable to those with the capacity to disturb it by violence. It is almost impossible to
impose. It cannot become a reality, still less be sustained, if those who must accept it are excluded from it. This reality
directs our attention to who is not at this gathering in Washington and what must be done to remedy the problems these
absences create.
Obviously, the party that won the democratically expressed mandate of the Palestinian people to represent them — Hamas
— is not there. Yet there can be no peace without its buy-in. Egypt and Jordan have been invited as observers. Yet they
have nothing to add to the separate peace agreements each long ago made with Israel. (Both these agreements were
explicitly premised on grudging Israeli undertakings to accept Palestinian self-determination. The Jewish state quickly
finessed both.) Activists from the Jewish diaspora disproportionately staff the American delegation. A failure to reconcile
either American Jews or the Palestine diaspora to peace would doom any accord. But the Palestinian diaspora will be
represented in Washington only in tenuous theory, not in fact.
Other Arabs, including the Arab League and the author of its peace initiative, Saudi Arabia, will not be at the talks
tomorrow. The reasons for this are both simple and complex. At one level they reflect both a conviction that this latest
installment of the "peace process" is just another in a long series of public entertainments for the American electorate and
also a lack of confidence in the authenticity of the Palestinian delegation. At another level, they result from the way the
United States has defined the problems to be solved and the indifference to Arab interests and views this definition
evidences. Then too, they reflect disconnects in political culture and negotiating style between Israelis, Arabs, and
Americans.
To begin with, neither Israel nor the conveners of this proposed new "peace process" have officially acknowledged or
responded to the Arab peace initiative of 2002. This offered normalization of relations with the Jewish state, should Israel
make peace with the Palestinians. Instead, the United States and the Quartet have seemed to pocket the Arab offer,
ignore its precondition that Israelis come to terms with Palestinians, and gone on to levy new demands.
In this connection, making Arab recognition of Israel's "right to exist" the central purpose of the "peace process" offends
Arabs on many levels. In framing the issue this way, Israel and the United States appear to be asking for something well
beyond pragmatic accommodation of the reality of a Jewish state in the Middle East. To the Arabs, Americans now seem
to be insisting on Arab endorsement of the idea of the state of Israel, the means by which that state was established, and
the manner in which it has comported itself. Must Arabs really embrace Zionism before Israel can cease expansion and
accept peace?

Arabs and Muslims familiar with European history can accept that European anti-Semitism justified the establishment of a
homeland for traumatized European Jews. But asking them even implicitly to agree that the forcible eviction of
Palestinian Arabs was a morally appropriate means to this end is both a nonstarter and seriously off-putting. So is asking
them to affirm that resistance to such displacement was and is sinful. Similarly, the Arabs see the demand that they
recognize a Jewish state with no fixed borders as a clever attempt to extract their endorsement of Israel's unilateral
expansion at Palestinian expense.
The lack of appeal in this approach has been compounded by a longstanding American habit of treating Arab concerns
about Israel as a form of anti-Semitism and tuning them out. Instead of hearing out and addressing Arab views, U.S.
peace processors have repeatedly focused on soliciting Arab acts of kindness toward Israel. They argue that gestures of
acceptance can help Israelis overcome their Holocaust-inspired political neuroses and take risks for peace.
Each time this notion of Arab diplomacy as psychotherapy for Israelis has been trotted out, it has been met with
incredulity. To most in the region, it encapsulates the contrast between Washington's sympathy and solicitude for Israelis
and its condescendingly exploitative view of Arabs. Some see it as a barely disguised appeal for a policy of appeasement
of Israel. Still others suspect an attempt to construct a "peace process" in which Arabs begin to supply Israel with gifts of
carrots so that Americans can continue to avoid applying sticks to it.
The effort to encourage Arab generosity as an offset to American political pusillanimity vis-a-vis Israel is ludicrously
unpersuasive. It has failed so many times that it should be obvious that it will not work. Yet it was a central element of
George Mitchell's mandate for "peace process" diplomacy. And it appears to have resurfaced as part of the proposed
follow-up to tomorrow's meeting between the parties in Washington. It should be no puzzle why the Saudis and other
Arabs could not be persuaded to join this gathering.
As a last thought before turning to what must be done, let me make a quick comment on a relevant cultural factor. Arabic
has two quite different words that are both translated as "negotiation," making a distinction that doesn't exist in either
English or Hebrew. One word, "musaawama," refers to the no-holds-barred bargaining process that takes place in
bazaars between strangers who may never see each other again and who therefore feel no obligation not to scam each
other. Another, "mufaawadhat," describes the dignified formal discussions about matters of honor and high principle that
take place on a basis of mutual respect and equality between statesmen who seek a continuing relationship.
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's travel to Jerusalem was a grand act of statesmanship to initiate a process of
mufaawadhat — relationship-building between leaders and their polities. So was the Arab peace initiative of 2002. It
called for a response in kind. The West muttered approvingly but did not act. After a while, Israel responded with
intermittent, somewhat oblique suggestions of willingness to haggle over terms. But an offer to bicker over the terms on
which a grand gesture has been granted is, not surprisingly, seen as insultingly unresponsive.
I cite this not to suggest that non-Arabs should adopt Arabic canons of thought, but to make a point about diplomatic
effectiveness. To move a negotiating partner in a desired direction, one must understand how that partner understands
things and help him to see a way forward that will bring him to an end he has been persuaded to want. One of the
reasons we can't seem to move things as we desire in the Middle East is that we don't make much effort to understand
how others reason and how they rank their interests. In the case of the Israel-Palestine conundrum, we Americans are
long on empathy and expertise about Israel and very, very short on these for the various Arab parties. The essential
militarism of U.S. policies in the Middle East adds to our difficulties. We have become skilled at killing Arabs. We have
forgotten how to listen to them or persuade them.

I am not myself an "Arabist," but I am old enough to remember when there were more than a few such people in the
American diplomatic service. These were officers who had devoted themselves to the cultivation of understanding and
empathy with Arab leaders so as to be able to convince these leaders that it was in their own interest to do things we saw
as in our interest. If we still have such people, we are hiding them well; we are certainly not applying their skills in our
Middle East diplomacy.
This brings me to a few thoughts about the Western and Arab interests at stake in the Holy Land and their implications for
what must be done.
In foreign affairs, interests are the measure of all things. My assumption is that Americans and Norwegians, indeed
Europeans in general, share common interests that require peace in the Holy Land. To my mind, these interests include -
but are, of course, not limited to — gaining security and acceptance for a democratic state of Israel; eliminating the gross
injustices and daily humiliations that foster Arab terrorism against Israel and its foreign allies and supporters, as well as
friendly Arab regimes; and reversing the global spread of religious strife and prejudice, including, very likely, a revival of
anti-Semitism in the West if current trends are not arrested. None of these aspirations can be fulfilled without an end to
the Israeli occupation and freedom for Palestinians.
Arab states, like Saudi Arabia, also have compelling reasons to want relief from occupation as well as self-determination
for Palestinians. They may not be concerned to preserve Israel's democracy, as we are, but they share an urgent interest
in ending the radicalization of their own populations, curbing the spread of Islamist terrorism, and eliminating the tensions
with the West that the conflict in the Holy Land fuels. These are the concerns that have driven them to propose peace, as
they very clearly did eight years ago. For related reasons, Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah has made inter-faith dialogue
and the promotion of religious tolerance a main focus of his domestic and international policy.
As the custodian of two of Islam's three sacred places of pilgrimage — Mecca and Medina — Saudi Arabia has long
transcended its own notorious religious narrow-mindedness to hold the holy places in its charge open to Muslims of all
sects and persuasions. This experience, joined with Islamic piety, reinforces a Saudi insistence on the exemption of
religious pilgrimage to Jerusalem from political interference or manipulation. The Ottoman Turks were careful to ensure
freedom of access for worship to adherents of the three Abrahamic faiths when they administered the city. It is an interest
that Jews, Christians, and Muslims share.
There is, in short, far greater congruity between Western and Arab interests affecting the Israel-Palestine dispute than is
generally recognized. This can be the basis for creative diplomacy. The fact that this has not occurred reflects
pathologies of political life in the United States that paralyze the American diplomatic imagination. Tomorrow's meeting
may well demonstrate that, the election of Barack Obama notwithstanding, the United States is still unfit to manage the
achievement of peace between Israel and the Arabs. If so, it is in the American interest as well as everyone else's that
others become the path-breakers, enlisting the United States as best they can in support of what they achieve, but not
expecting America to overcome its incapacity to lead.
Here, I think, there is a lesson to be drawn from the Norwegian experience in the 1990s. The Clinton Administration was
happy to organize the public relations for the Oslo accords but did not take ownership of them. It did little to protect them
from subversion and overthrow, and nothing to insist on their implementation. Only a peace process that is protected
from Israel's ability to manipulate American politics can succeed.

This brings me to how Europeans and Arabs might work together to realize the objectives both share with most
Americans: establishing internationally recognized borders for Israel, securing freedom for the Palestinians, and ending
the stimulus to terrorism in the region and beyond it that strife in the Holy Land entails. I have only four suggestions to
present today. I expect that more ideas will emerge from the discussion period. A serious effort to cooperate with the
Arabs of the sort that Norway is uniquely capable of contriving could lead to the development of still more options for joint
or parallel action on behalf of peace.
Now to my suggestions, presented in ascending order of difficulty, from the least to the most controversial.
First, get behind the Arab peace initiative. Saudi Arab culture frowns on self-promotion and the Kingdom is less gifted
than most at public diplomacy. Political factors inhibit official Arab access to the Israeli press. The Israeli media have
published some — mostly dismissive — commentary on the Arab peace initiative but left most Israelis ignorant of its
contents and unfamiliar with its text. Why not buy space in the Israeli media to give Israelis a chance to read the Arab
League declaration and consider the opportunities it presents? I suspect the Saudis, as well as other members of the
Arab League, would consider it constructive for an outside party to do this. It might facilitate other sorts of cooperation
with them in which European capabilities can also compensate for Arab reticence. The Turks and other non-Arab
Muslims should be brought in as full participants in any such efforts. This wouldn't be bad for Europe's relations with
both. By the way, given the U.S. media's notorious one-sidedness and American ignorance about the Arab peace plan, a
well-targeted advertising campaign in the United States might not be a bad idea either.
Second, help create a Palestinian partner for peace. There can be no peace with Israel unless there are officials who
are empowered by the Palestinian people to negotiate and ratify it. Israel has worked hard to divide the Palestinians so
as to consolidate its conquest of their homeland. Saudi Arabia has several times sought to create a Palestinian peace
partner for Israel by bringing Fatah, Hamas, and other factions together. On each occasion, Israel, with U.S. support, has
acted to preclude this. Active organization of non-American Western support for diplomacy aimed at restoring a unity
government to the Palestinian Authority could make a big difference. The Obama Administration would be under strong
domestic political pressure to join Israel in blocking a joint European-Arab effort to accomplish this. Under some
circumstances, however, it might welcome being put to this test.
Third, reaffirm and enforce international law. The UN Security Council is charged with enforcing the rule of law
internationally. In the case of the Middle East, however, the Council's position at the apex of the international system has
served to erode and subvert the ideal of a rule-bound international order. Almost forty American vetoes have prevented
the application to the Israeli occupying authorities of the Geneva Conventions, the Nuremberg precedents, human rights
conventions, and relevant Security Council directives. American diplomacy on behalf of the Jewish state has silenced the
collective voice of the international community as Israel has illegally colonized and annexed broad swaths of occupied
territory, administered collective punishment to a captive people, assassinated their political leaders, massacred civilians,
barred UN investigators, defied mandatory Security Council resolutions, and otherwise engaged in scofflaw behavior,
usually with only the flimsiest of legally irrelevant excuses.
If ethnic cleansing, settlement activity, and the like are not just "unhelpful" but illegal, the international community should
find a way to say so, even if the UN Security Council cannot. Otherwise, the most valuable legacy of Atlantic civilization -
its vision of the rule of law — will be lost. When one side to a dispute is routinely exempted from principles, all exempt
themselves, and the law of the jungle prevails. The international community needs collectively to affirm that Israel, both
as occupier and as regional military hegemon, is legally accountable internationally for its actions. If the UN General
Assembly cannot "unite for peace" to do what an incapacitated Security Council cannot, member states should not shrink

from working in conference outside the UN framework. All sides in the murder and mayhem in the Holy Land and beyond
need to understand that they are not above the law. If this message is firmly delivered and enforced, there will be a better
chance for peace.
Fourth, set a deadline linked to an ultimatum. Accept that the United States will frustrate any attempt by the UN
Security Council to address the continuing impasse between Israel and the Palestinians. Organize a global conference
outside the UN system to coordinate a decision to inform the parties to the dispute that if they cannot reach agreement in
a year, one of two solutions will be imposed. Schedule a follow-up conference for a year later. The second conference
would consider whether to recommend universal recognition of a Palestinian state in the area beyond Israel's 1967
borders or recognition of Israel's achievement of de jure as well as de facto sovereignty throughout Palestine (requiring
Israel to grant all governed by it citizenship and equal rights at pain of international sanctions, boycott, and
disinvestment). Either formula would force the parties to make a serious effort to strike a deal or to face the
consequences of their recalcitrance. Either formula could be implemented directly by the states members of the
international community. Admittedly, any serious deadline would provoke a political crisis in Israel and lead to diplomatic
confrontation with the United States as well as Israel, despite the Obama Administration itself having proclaimed a one-
year deadline in order to entice the Palestinians to tomorrow's talks. Yet both Israel and the United States would benefit
immensely from peace with the Palestinians.
Time is running out. The two-state solution may already have been overtaken by Israeli land grabs and settlement
activity. Another cycle of violence is likely in the offing. If so, it will not be local or regional, but global in its reach. Israel's
actions are delegitimizing and isolating it even as they multiply the numbers of those in the region and beyond who are
determined to destroy it. Palestinian suffering is a reproach to all humanity that posturing alone cannot begin to
alleviate. It has become a cancer on the Islamic body politic. It is infecting every extremity of the globe with the rage
against injustice that incites terrorism.
It is time to try new approaches. That is why the question of whether there is a basis for expanded diplomatic cooperation
between Europeans and Arabs is such a timely one. And it is why I was pleased as well as honored to have been asked
to set the stage for a discussion of this issue.

Americans Most Likely to Favor GOP
Newcomers for Congress
Three in four believe influx of new members would improve
Congress
by Jeffrey M. Jones
PRINCETON, NJ -- It appears that the best type of candidate to be this fall is a Republican challenger. Given a choice of
four hypothetical candidates of differing party affiliations and experience, Americans are most likely to prefer "a
Republican who has not served in Congress." Those who would prefer a Democratic candidate opt for an incumbent over
a newcomer.
These results, based on an Aug. 27-30 USA Today/Gallup poll, underscore the advantageous political environment for
Republicans and non-incumbents this midterm election season. Overall, a majority of Americans prefer a Republican
candidate (regardless of experience) to a Democrat, 53% to 40%. And a majority also prefer a non-incumbent (regardless
of party affiliation) to an incumbent, 54% to 39%.
The fact that Americans who prefer a Republican candidate want one who is new to Congress suggests that these voters
want both GOP control of Congress and the new perspectives that come from members with no prior Washington
experience. Americans who favor Democratic candidates, on the other hand, apparently are more satisfied with the type
of experienced representatives now in Congress.
One would naturally expect Democrats to prefer Democratic candidates, and Republicans to prefer Republican
candidates, and that is the case when looking at the data by party. But partisans' preferences for incumbents versus
challengers seem to be influenced by their knowledge that the Democrats currently have a majority in Congress, and thus,
more Democrats will be defending House seats this fall. Democrats are more likely to prefer a Democrat who is in
Congress to a Democrat who is not, and Republicans are more likely to prefer a Republican outside of Congress to one
who is currently serving there. Independents also show a strong preference for Republican non-incumbents.

The data do not necessarily indicate how Americans would vote in the fall when presented with a choice of two specific
candidates for Congress. This fall, voters will generally be asked to choose between one Republican and one Democratic
candidate, one of whom may be an incumbent. When asked in the same poll whether they are more likely to vote for the
Republican or the Democratic congressional candidate in their district if the elections were held today, 48% of Americans
say the Republican and 43% the Democrat.
The appeal of non-incumbents is apparent in another question in the poll that finds 75% of Americans saying Congress
would be changed for the better if "most of the present members of Congress are replaced with new members." Only 14%
think that would make Congress worse. This is consistent with Gallup's findings from earlier this year suggesting strong
anti-incumbent sentiment.
Americans across key demographic subgroups widely share the belief that Congress would be improved if most members
were turned out of office. However, there is a significant gap by political party, with 89% of Republicans versus 63% of
Democrats saying that replacing most members of Congress would be beneficial. Again, the difference likely stems from
Democrats' current status as the majority party in Congress.
Implications
In a year when Americans are dissatisfied with the state of the nation and give relatively low ratings to the president and
Congress, it is not politically beneficial to be either an incumbent or a member of the ruling party. That is reflected in
Americans' preference for a Republican newcomer over other types of candidates they may have a chance to vote for in
this fall's midterm congressional elections. It is also reflected in prior analysis of historical Gallup data showing greater
seat turnover in Congress when the president and Congress are unpopular.

Americans Give GOP Edge on Most Election
Issues
Greatest Republican advantages on terrorism, immigration,
federal spending
by Jeffrey M. Jones
PRINCETON, NJ -- A new USA Today/Gallup poll finds Americans saying the Republicans in Congress would do a better
job than the Democrats in Congress of handling seven of nine key election issues. The parties are essentially tied on
healthcare, with the environment being the lone Democratic stren th.
The Republicans' advantage on most issues is an indication of the currently favorable political environment for the party.
Of particular note is the parity between the two parties on healthcare, an issue on which Americans historically have
viewed the Democrats as superior.
A similar USA Today/Gallup poll conducted in October 2006, just prior to Democrats' major gains in that fall's elections,
highlights the potential implications of these findings. That poll, which includes several issues measured in the current
survey, found the Democrats leading on all eight issues tested at that time, including some usual Republican strengths
like terrorism and moral values.
With Republicans now having the advantage on most issues, the party may be poised to make major gains in
congressional seats, just as the Democrats did in 2006. Indeed, Gallup tracking of registered voters' preferences in the
2010 generic ballot for Congress continues to find the Republicans ahead of the Democrats, as it has for the past five
weeks.
The Economy Matters Most
The Democrats' advantage on the issue of the environment is likely not something the party can leverage to improve its
2010 electoral fortunes, as Americans rank it at the bottom of the list in terms of its importance to their vote. Rather,
economic concerns are paramount, with a majority of Americans rating the economy, jobs, and federal spending (along
with government corruption) as extremely important.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771300 Date: 08/31/2015
The Republican advantages on these economic matters range from a low of +5 on jobs to a high of +15 on federal
spending. Terrorism -- the issue on which Republicans have the greatest advantage over Democrats -- is rated as very
important by 47% of Americans, putting it in the middle of the list.
Bottom Line
Republicans' perceptual advantage on most key election issues reinforces the party's advantageous positioning heading
into the stretch run of the 2010 election campaign. It is not clear whether Americans give the Republicans the edge on
these issues because they have confidence in the GOP to make progress in addressing the major problems facing the
country, or whether the ratings have more to do with the public's frustration with the incumbent Democratic Party's
performance to date.
The Democrats' hopes for improving their fortunes may hinge on convincing voters they have superior plans for jump-
starting the economy, the issue of uppermost importance in Americans' minds. That could be tough to do when, after
nearly 20 months of Democratic leadership in Congress and the White House, Americans' opinions of the economy
remain negative and have become more pessimistic in recent weeks.

Politics & Foreign policy
Clinton's aim is true as Democrats' top gun
By Edward Luce in Washington
Published: October 12 2010 20:43 I Last updated: October 12 2010 20:43
Nobody would go so far as to call it a comeback. But Bill Clinton's appearances on the midterm election trail are starting to
turn voters' heads in a way that Barack Obama's simply are not.
Democratic operatives say that Mr Clinton, who went through in 1994 the kind of setback that pollsters say Mr Obama will
face in less than three weeks, is more effective at presenting the election as a choice between starkly different
alternatives rather than a referendum on what people think of the Obama administration.
So far the president, who has booked most of the next three weeks for campaigning, has been unable to pull that off. This
week alone, Mr Clinton has shaken up two Senate races — in Kentucky and West Virginia — with appearances that have
assisted Democratic candidates. Mr Clinton was due to speak in Las Vegas on Tuesday night to assist the embattled
Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, and then move onto California later in the week.
"Bill Clinton is about as close to a secret weapon as the Democratic party has got," says Norm Ornstein, a political analyst
at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. "He has this ability to fire up the Democratic base that almost nobody
else can do right now." Mr Clinton's intervention in Kentucky, where Jack Conway, the Democratic candidate, is locked in
a tight race with Rand Paul, the Tea Party icon, is a good case in point.
At the weekend Mr Clinton described Mr Paul, who wants drastically to shrink the size of the US federal government and
has talked of abolishing the Federal Reserve, as a "radical with no record to back it up". Mr Paul, who has never run for
elected office, hit back by reminding voters of Mr Clinton's former Monica Lewinsky scandal. "I am not sure I would trust a
man who had sex with an intern," said Mr Paul. "I mean, do you think he's an honourable person?"
Mr Paul's trip down memory lane appears to have backfired. Few voters seem to care any longer about a scandal that
occurred amid what in retrospect looks like a golden age of balanced budgets, job creation and the absence of foreign
wars.
"Bill Clinton's strength is that he knows how to fight back and turn adversity into advantage," says Tad Devine, a veteran
Democratic operative. "He is also able to enter an individual race, take the temperature, understand what people are
feeling and then base his appeal to voters on that."
In the West Virginia Senate race, where Joe Manchin, the governor, is trailing John Raese, a wealthy local businessman,
Mr Clinton on Monday came out punching. Referring to Mr Raese's plush Florida vacation home, the former president
said: "I'm here for a lot of reasons. One is that I don't think it's fair for West Virginia to have one senator and Florida to
have three."
Acknowledging voter anger in a state where Mr Obama has 29 per cent rating, among the lowest in the country, Mr
Clinton added: 'I am old enough to know that if you make a decision when you are mad — and I am not just talking about
politics here — there is about an 80 per cent chance you will make a mistake."
In contrast, a lot of Democrats are critical of the way Mr Obama has framed the midterm campaign, shifting from one
attack line to another without sticking to an overarching narrative. Last month, Mr Obama turned on John Boehner, the
Republican congressional leader, in what looked like a move to depict him as the voters' alternative.

More recently, Mr Obama has switched to attacking the Chamber of Commerce for allegedly funnelling foreign money into
attack ads. But it has generated a lot of criticism. "This election is awash with undisclosed money and it's fair to point out
how disadvantaged the Democrats have been," says one consultant. "But it isn't good politics at this late stage when
voters clearly want to hear about the economy."

Re: Post mid-terms strategy
What I hear from Republican sources and elsewhere and what it means for Republican strategy:
1. Rove is telling his donors that the ticket in 2012 is Romney/Barbour. Haley Barbour is Rove's ally. Together they
constitute the heart of the GOP establishment. In a potential Republican administration Barbour would be a new kind of
Cheney, but more politically skillful.
2. Rove is at war with Palin. He has told his donors she must be stopped. Palin is well aware. The Politico story filled with
anonymous quotes about a murky establishment vs. Palin is about the Death Star of Rove/Barbour. Ironies: Rove doubled
down on a base strategy for Bush, galvanizing the right wing, now spun out of his control to Palin. The GOP used the far
right and Palin in the mid-terms and now have to kill them in presidential nomination politics. Attacking Palin only builds
her stature with the right. She plays instinctively to the base, but can she play a long game against the big boys
determined to destroy her?
3. Palin has already aligned Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh on her side. Fox News is being split. Murdoch gave his big
donation to the Republican Governors Association, headed by Barbour.
4. Malcolm Hoenlein has been raising money hand over fist for the Republicans through Eric Cantor, now his vehicle. The
donors are many of the same US donors to Bibi and Likud. Implications obvious.
5. The House Republicans have already'planned to primary all Senate Republican moderates in the next cycle. Olympia
Snowe is a particular target.
6. In the Senate, Jim DeMint continues to be a Fifth Column of the right, allied to the House Republicans, against remaining
Senate GOP moderates. He will be reinforced after this election with Rand Paul, et al. Paul, of course, hates Mitch
McConnell, and vice versa.
7. McConnell's statement the day before the mid-terms that the goal of the GOP is to make Obama a one term president is,
in fact, their agenda. Everything in the House and Senate will be bent to that end.
8. Can the House Republicans and Senate Republicans restrain themselves in their own interest and McConnell's stated
aim? Boehner is despised by the younger, more conservative members of the House Republican Conference. They are
repelled by his personal behavior. He is louche, alcoholic, lazy, and without any commitment to any principle. Boehner
has already tried to buy the members with campaign contributions and committee assignments, which he has already
promised to potentially difficult members. His hold is insecure. He is not Gingrich, the natural leader of a "revolution,"
riding the crest into power. He is careworn and threadbare, banal and hollow, holding nobody's enduring loyalty. Boehner
is beholden and somewhat scared of his base. He twitches when they make gestures that might undermine his position.
His impulse is to hand out money. His aim is to recreate DeLay, Inc, with Jerry Lewis, who will be the new chairman of
Appropriations. But Boehner is neither feared nor loved. He's a would-be DeLay without the whip. He's the one at the end
of the lash. Which means he will be under great pressure and find it hard to sustain a moderate, reasonable strategy of

restraint. McConnell is relatively in the same position in the Senate. On the other hand, the Congressional Republicans
are vulnerable to a strategy that takes advantage of their internal divisions. Policies/tactics should be calculated to locate
GOP fissures, find political space by widening schisms, and ultimately break them apart. This is, emphatically, not a
strategy of bipartisanship as Obama has pursued it so far. It is a different and more informed approach.

7. McConnell's statement the day before the mid-terms that the goal of the GOP is to make
Obama a one term president is, in fact, their agenda. Everything in the House and Senate will be
bent to that end.
8.Can the House Republicans and Senate Republicans restrain themselves in their own interest
and McConnell's stated aim? Boehner is despised by the younger, more conservative members
of the House Republican Conference. They are repelled by his personal behavior. He is louche,
alcoholic, lazy, and without any commitment to any principle. Boehner has already tried to buy
the members with campaign contributions and committee assignments, which he has already
promised to potentially difficult members. His hold is insecure. He is not Gingrich, the natural
leader of a "revolution," riding the crest into power. He is careworn and threadbare, banal and
hollow, holding nobody's enduring loyalty. Boehner is beholden and somewhat scared of his
base. He twitches when they make gestures that might undermine his position. His impulse is to
hand out money. His aim is to recreate DeLay, Inc, with Jerry Lewis, who will be the new
chairman of Appropriations. But Boehner is neither feared nor loved. He's a would-be DeLay
without the whip. He's the one at the end of the lash. Which means he will be under great
pressure and find it hard to sustain a moderate, reasonable strategy of restraint. McConnell is
relatively in the same position in the Senate. On the other hand, the Congressional Republicans
are vulnerable to a strategy that takes advantage of their internal divisions. Policies/tactics should
be calculated to locate GOP fissures, find political space by widening schisms, and ultimately
break them apart. This is, emphatically, not a strategy of bipartisanship as Obama has pursued it
so far. It is a different and more informed approach.

Re: Post mid-terms strategy
What I hear from Republican sources and elsewhere and what it means for Republican strategy:
1. Rove is telling his donors that the ticket in 2012 is Romney/Barbour. Haley Barbour is Rove's
ally. Together they constitute the heart of the GOP establishment. In a potential Republican

administration Barbour would be a new kind of Cheney, but more politically skillful.
2. Rove is at war with Palin. He has told his donors she must be stopped. Palin is well aware. The
Politico story filled with anonymous quotes about a murky establishment vs. Palin is about the
Death Star of Rove/Barbour. Ironies: Rove doubled down on a base strategy for Bush,
galvanizing the right wing, now spun out of his control to Palin. The GOP used the far right and
Palin in the mid-terms and now have to kill them in presidential nomination politics. Attacking
PalM only builds her stature with the right. She plays instinctively to the base, but can she play a
long game against the big boys determined to destroy her?
3.Palin has already aligned Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh on her side. Fox News is being
split. Murdoch gave his big donation to the Republican Governors Association, headed by
Barbour.
4. Malcolm Hoenlein has been raising money hand over fist for the Republicans through Eric
Cantor, now his vehicle. The donors are many of the same US donors to Bibi and Likud.
Implications obvious.
5.The House Republicans have already planned to primary all Senate Republican moderates in
the next cycle. Olympia Snowe is a particular target.
6. In the Senate, Jim DeMint continues to be a Fifth Column of the right, allied to the House
Republicans, against remaining Senate GOP moderates. He will be reinforced after this election
with Rand Paul, et al. Paul, of course, hates Mitch McConnell, and vice versa.
7.McConnell's statement the day before the mid-terms that the goal of the GOP is to make
°barna a one term president is, in fact, their agenda. Everything in the House and Senate will be
bent to that end.

The Return of Ghosts: Debating the rise of Geert Wilders and
the far-right at the Nexus Symposium
On 11.18.10, By Max
The Nexus Institute's Return of Ghosts conference was inspired by the rise of far-right politician Geert Wilders in the
Netherlands
I spent last week in Amsterdam, where I participated in the "Return of Ghosts" symposium of the Nexus Institute, a
discussion/debate about the resurgence of neo-fascism in Europe and anti-democratic trends in the West. Besides
providing a forum for debating European politics, the symposium was the occasion for the first public appearance in
Europe by Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa since he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature last month. The arrival
of Vargas Llosa, one of the world's foremost intellectuals, resulted in an overflow crowd filled with members of the Dutch
media, the country's political class, and the royal family.
Even with Vargas Llosa in the spotlight, the participants' attention was focused on Geert Wilders, the leader of the far-right
Dutch People's Party for Freedom and Democracy, which is now the third leading party in the Netherlands. With his
gathering influence, Wilders has essentially placed the Dutch coalition government in a stranglehold; the government
meets with him every Wednesday to gauge his opinions and ask for his instructions. While Wilders dictates at will to the
government, he remains independent of it, comfortably avoiding the consequences of policies he has helped to shape. It
is the perfect position for a politician whose agenda is comprised exclusively of xenophobic populism, and typical strategy
of the far-right in countries across the continent.
Wilders' base lies in the mostly Catholic south, where ironically few people have ever encountered a Muslim. He has also
generated support in the city of Groeningen, once a citadel of the communists. Seeking to expand his base, Wilders
promised to hire scores of "animal cops" to investigate and prosecute the abuse of animals, a clever wedge strategy in the
only country I know of that has a party dedicated exclusively to animal rights. Of course, Wilders could care less about our
furry friends. His stated goal is to end immigration not just to Holland but to all of Europe; ban the Quran (free speech is
only for the "Judeo-Christian" community), and severely limit the rights of Muslim citizens of Europe by, for instance,
instituting what he called a "head rag tax" on Muslim women. Wilders' international allies include the goosestepping neo-
Nazis of the English Defense League, the far-right pogromist Pam Geller, the Belgian neo-fascist party Vlaams Belang,
and a substantial portion of the US neocon elite. Over the course of just a few years, he has become perhaps the most
influential Islamophobe in the world.
But does this make Wilders a fascist? Rob Riemen, the director of the Nexus Institute, thinks so. Riemen has just
published a book entitled "De Eeuwige Terugkeer Van Het Fascisme," or "The Eternal Return of Fascism" (I eagerly await
its English translation), dedicated to highlighting the danger of Wilders' eerily familiar brand of right-wing populism. In the
book, Riemen urges readers to compare Wilders' politics to the early incarnations of European fascism, not to the
genocidal terminal stage fascism of late World War II. He calls the parallels between Wilders and the early fascists "one-
and-one." In an economic and civilizational crisis like the kind the Netherlands is facing, Riemen warns that reactionary
figures like Wilders can easily seize power while centrist elements stand by politely and passively, refusing to call a spade
a spade. Where Wilders' ascendancy will lead is unknown, but if he is not stopped in his tracks, Riemen is certain the

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771400 Date: 08/31/2015
story will not end well. In the week after its publication, Riemen's book flew off the shelves, selling 5000 copies while
generating heated reactions from across the spectrum of debate.
Riemen told me that despite the public enthusiasm for his book, his characterization of Wilders has been attacked as "un-
Dutch." In Dutch culture, as in so many others, open confrontation is avoided at all cost. Political disagreement is
welcomed only if it is expressed in a collegial manner, as though nothing more than reputations were at stake. So the
Dutch cultural elite generally goes along to get along. The resistance Riemen has met since he called Wilders out seemed
to have alarmed and frustrated him. Why was it so difficult for liberal elements in the Netherlands to recognize the clear
resonances of fascism in Wilders' political style? he wondered. And why did they seem more concerned with regulating
the terms of debate than with forming a united front against the far-right? Once the symposium opened and I was able to
see the Dutch elite in action, I began to understand Riemen's indignation.
The symposium began with a speech by Vargas Llosa, a complex personality who has allied himself with center-right
parties in Spain and elsewhere but whose politics remain fundamentally rooted in cultural liberalism. Vargas Llosa's
differences with leaders of the left, which he used to belong to, exploded over the issue of free trade. He is an ardent neo-
liberal and reviles Latin populists like Hugo Chavez and 011anta Humala who advocate protectionism and industrial
nationalization.
Vargas Llosa decorated his speech with literary metaphors and natural imagery to describe the challenges of democracy,
particularly in Europe. But the body of the address was devoted to the supposed threat Islamic extremism posed to
Western civilization. Vargas Llosa singled out suicide bombing as the most dangerous phenomenon, pointing to the
Madrid and London bombings by al-Qaida inspired operatives, while curiously not mentioning suicide attacks by secular
groups like the Tamil Tigers and the Kurdish PKK, or the nationalistic suicide terror by Palestinian militants (Vargas Llosa
declared in his speech that "Israel deserves to be treated like any other nation," and has been harshly critical of the state
in the past).
During the first panel, which I participated in, Fania Oz-Salzberger, an Israeli professor of history and the daughter of
famed author Amos Oz, boasted to crowd of Israel's "vibrant democracy." She was enthusiastically seconded by Mitchell
Cohen, a former editor of Dissent who has devoted considerable energy to assailing anti-Zionist Jews, writing that "the
dominant species of anti-Semitism encourages anti-Zionism." I found it odd that neither expressed any concern over the
almost endless stream of anti-democratic laws passing through the Knesset, or by the general authoritarian, anti-liberal
trend in Israeli society. Oz-Salzberger went on to announce to a smattering of applause that "Geert Wilders and politicians
like him are not welcomed by Israelis."
Yet Wilders is one of Israel's most frequent guests, having visited the country over 40 times in 20 years. In fact, he claims
that his views on Islam and Arabs were forged while living on an Israeli moshav. "Nowhere did I have the special feeling of
solidarity that I get when I land at Ben Gurion airport," he once said. Wilders reportedly receives heavy support from Dutch
financial backers of Israel, and has met with a range of Israeli officials. His closest allies lie within the extremist settler
movement, prompting him to call for the forced transfer of Palestinians to Jordan. Members of the liberal Zionist
intelligensia like Oz-Salzberger may not not want Wilders around, but who in Israel is listening to them? Israel's
mainstream leadership echoes Wilders' crudest talking points on a regular basis, while the Zionist left clings to a dwindling
handful of Knesset seats and watches passively — even resentfully — as a rag-tag band of leftist radicals fights for
equality for all. Consider a recent statement by former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who is seen as a centrist within the
Israeli political spectrum: "The origin of terrorism is within Islam," Olmert declared this month.
The pro-Israel position of the new breed of European far-rightists has to be recognized as much more than a convenient
political tactic. Of course, saying you "stand with Israel," as Wilders so often does, is an easy way to insulate yourself from
charges of anti-Semitism. But the extreme right is also attracted to Israel because the country represents its highest
ideals. While some critics see Israel as a racist apartheid state, people like Wilders see Israel as a racist apartheid state
— and they like it. They richly enjoy when Israel mows down Arab Muslims by the dozens and tells the world to go to hell;
they admire Israel's settler culture; and most of all, they yearn to live in a land like Israel that privileges its ethnic majority
above all others to the point that it systematically humiliates and dispossesses the swarthy racial outclass. The endgame
of the far-right is to make Europe less tolerant and more Israeli.
After the Italian philosopher Paolo Flores D'Arcais proclaimed that Italy was no longer a democratic country, citing PM
Silvio Berlusconi's control over 90 percent of the country's media, the government's deep seated corruption and the Prime
Minister's repeated attempts to impose onerous restrictions on journalistic freedom, Riemen asked me if the United States
was a democracy given the the rapidly rising influence of corporations over the media and elections. After two panelists
had described Israel as a vibrant democracy while another labeled Italy a non-democratic quasi-dictatorship, I decided
that our definition of democracy was subjective at best. So I sidestepped the question and outlined a few of the greatest
blows to American democracy, from the elimination of the Fairness Doctrine to the Telecommunications Deregulation Act
to the Citizens United SCOTUS decision. Later in the evening, D'Arcais would remark to me with amazement that he
never knew American media was ever regulated in the first place.
During the 20 minutes or so when students of Tilburg University were able to question the panel, one student asked
whether suicide terror was a uniquely Islamic phenomenon, apparently referring to Vargas Llosa's address. I responded
that it of course was not, citing the example of secular groups like the Tamil Tigers which brought the tactic into practice
the second suicide. I recommended the audience review the research of Robert Pape, the University of Chicago political
scientist who demonstrated a clear connection between the American and Israeli occupation of Middle Eastern countries
and the motivations of suicide bombers. Oz-Salzberger jumped in, proclaiming that occupation has little or nothing to do

with the motives of suicide bombers. She did not marshal any evidence to support her point, possibly because our time
was so limited. It would have been hard to do so, however, without supporting the fundamental argument of Wilders about
Islam's inherent violence — or the even sillier theory by the Israeli filmmaker/professional hasbarist Pierre Rehov that
suicide bombers are motivated by sexual repression.
Next, the Dutch panel took the stage. The main attraction was Frits Bolkstein, the longtime leader of the People's Party for
Freedom and Democracy who employed Wilders as his parliamentary aide, providing him a stepping stone to his political
career. He was a silver haired curmudgeon from aristocratic stock who reminded me instantly of the "paleocon" characters
I've met while covering white nationalist conventions like American Renaissance.
"Everything went wrong when the government became impressed in the 90's with the idea of the 'good stranger,"
Bolkstein declared. "If the previous governments had tightened their immigration laws, there would not have been a Mr.
Wilders."
The only member of the panel to mount a significant challenge to Bolkstein was the Tilburg University professor Paul
Frissen, who argued that the rule of law and basic standards of democracy protects "the right to be fundamentalist." The
other panelists either gave Bolkstein's xenophobia a pass or attempted to surpass his resentment of Muslims. After
Bolkstein lightly criticized Wilders' call for banning the Quran, remarking that "what he says about Islam is nonsense"
because it contradicts the freedom of religion, AB Klink, a former Dutch senator and ex-Minister of Health, chimed in."It's
not nonsense because Islam is so different in its cultural values than ours," Klink claimed.
Then, when Bolkstein called for shutting down Islamic schools, Frissen reminded him that state-supported Christian
schools in the Dutch Bible belt teach theocratic concepts as well. Meindert Fennema, the political biographer of Wilders,
entered the debate to demand that all religious schools be closed. "I'm against all forms of religious teaching!" he proudly
exclaimed, sending gales of applause through the audience. "How can you call yourself a liberal?" Frissen asked with a
tone of exasperation. Fennema ignored him.
During question time, a young freelance writer from India named Natasha Ginwala asked Bolkstein to answer for the
"ghost of neo-colonialism," which "the African people never voted for." She mentioned the exploitative deals forced on
developing countries by transnational oil companies, possibly alluding to Bolkstein's role as a manager at Royal Dutch
Shell in authoritarian countries like El Salvador, Indonesia, and Honduras during the 1970's (I'm sure nothing unseemly
happened during Bo!stein's tenure in these places). Bolkstein's responded bluntly, "If these countries try to be self-
sufficient it just doesn't work!"
After the symposium, I talked to Ginwala and a group of her friends, who were mostly immigrant students. They were
appalled by the ignorance of the Dutch panelists. "None of them knew the first thing about Islam," an Arab student
remarked. "They couldn't even pretend to understand what Muslims actually believe." Ginwala added, "How can Bolkstein
tell me my country can't be self-sufficient? I come from India. It's one of the most diversified economies on the planet."
I was not in Amsterdam long enough to do any formal reporting. However, I did notice that all of the immigrants I spoke to
were closely and nervously following the rise of the right. At the airport, while waiting to board my flight, I talked to a 20-
something security guard named Muhammad who seemed almost as bored as I was. Muhammad had spent his whole life
in Amsterdam, but his parents were from Cairo, Egypt. He told me he wanted to take his girlfriend on a trip to New York
City and Miami someday. When I brought up the topic of Wilders, he scoffed at his perception of Muslims. "Most of us
aren't even religious," Muhammad said. "When I hear him talking about Muslims wanting to take over, I just laugh. I'm like,
is this guy serious?"
But he did not underestimate Wilders' appeal. "Everything he does and everything he says, it seems like it's carefully
planned. He obviously knows what he's doing. And they let him get away with it," Muhammad remarked. "Look, I'm just a
citizen, I'm nobody, but if I say something about Christians or Jews that the government doesn't like, I'll be punished. But
when Wilders, who is a public official, says all the things he says about Muslims, nothing happens to him. Instead, more
and more people are voting for him."

A poisoned process holds little hope
By David Gardner
Published: August 25 2010 22:46 1 Last updated: August 25 2010 22:46
„
As the caravans of Middle East peace negotiators rumble into Washington next week for the umpteenth time, the
pervasive cynicism and sense of deja vu all over again is overwhelming — and with good reason.
The Middle East peace process long ago turned into a tortured charade of pure process while events on the ground — in
particular the relentless and strategic Israeli colonisation of occupied Palestinian land — pull in the opposite direction to
peace. "We have all been colluding in a gigantic confidence trick," is how one Arab minister puts it, "and here we go
again."
While many factors had combined to hand veto powers to rejectionists on both sides, the heart of the question remains
the continuing Israeli occupation. It is essential to remember that the biggest single increase of Jewish settlers on Arab
and — a 50 per cent rise — took place in 1992-96 under the governments of peace-makers Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon
Peres at.the high-water mark of the Oslo peace accords. Many Israelis will point to the perfidy of the late Yassir Arafat,
who wanted to talk peace but keep the option of armed resistance dangerously in play. But what killed Oslo was the
occupation. The second intifada that erupted a decade ago was essentially the Oslo war.
A decade on, the Israeli settlement enterprise has turned the occupied West Bank into a discontiguous scattering of
cantons, walled in by a security barrier built on yet more annexed Arab land and criss-crossed by segregated Israeli roads
linking the settlements. Last month, B'Tselem, the Israeli human rights group, published a study showing Israel has now
taken 42 per cent of the West Bank, with 300,000 settlers there and another 200,000 in East Jerusalem. The siege of
Gaza has turned that sliver of land into a vast, open-air prison.
The main feature of the present situationi is the disconnect between the high politics of the utterly discredited peace
process and these — in Israeli parlance — "facts on the ground".
At last month's White House summit, where Barack Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu massaged their long estrangement
into a political armistice, the US president praised the Israeli prime minister as a leader "willing to take risks for peace".
But there is no evidence for this whatsoever. True, in June last year, in response to Mr Obama's Cairo speech denying
any legitimacy to Israel's settlements, Mr Netanyahu forced himself to utter the words "Palestinian state" — but he
surrounded them with barbed-wire caveats that voided them of meaning.
Indeed, the words all sides use — peace, resolution, security, and so on — may be the same; but what each side means by
them is different.
The mainstream Palestinian leaders, President Mahmoud Abbas and Salem Fayyad, the prime minister, and the Quartet
made up of the US, the European Union, the UN and Russia, talk of a negotiated resolution. This means two states living
in peace and security, and a Palestinian homeland on the 22 per cent of Mandate Palestine taken by Israel in the 1967
Arab-Israeli war. East Jerusalem would serve as the capital of the West Bank and Gaza, with marginal land swaps to
preserve some Israeli settlements near Jerusalem. But what does Mr Netanyahu mean?
He has been most clear on what he does not mean. For a start, he has set his face against any concessions on
Jerusalem. He wants to keep most settlements except for the far-flung "ideological" ones and the 100-plus "outposts"
established as pawns to be traded once the chess game began. His idea of a demilitarised Palestinian state is more like a
sort of supra-municipal administration than a self-determined, independent government.

Will he surprise us, on the hackneyed Nixon and China principle that holds it is politicians of the right who most easily
close difficult deals? There is little to suggest that:
The thinking of Mr Netanyahu, son of a celebrated promoter of Greater Israel, has always been profoundly irredentist.
While his nationalist Likud faces the constraints of being in coalition with an assortment of ultra-rightist and ultra-orthodox
parties as well as Labour, that was plainly his choice; the centrist Kadima party was (and remains) an alternative. To be
fair, Israel's electoral system — with a low threshold for entry into the Knesset that makes multi-party coalitions inevitable —
means lobbies such as the settlers can take the national interest hostage. But Mr Netanyahu magnifies this by his choice
of partners and by diligently firing up the ultra-hawks in the pro-Israel lobby in the US.
As risks he. has taken for peace, Exhibit A is the much-hyped moratorium on settlement-building, which expires next
month and has, in any case, been speciously interpreted. While the bulldozers to build settlements have been idling,
moreover, the bulldozers demolishing Palestinian homes have been roaring: the rate of demolition in and around
Jerusalem has doubled this year, while the army has just razed the village of al-Farisiye in the Jordan Valley, in line with
Mr Netanyahu's strategically obsolete obsession with keeping the valley as Israel's eastern border.
As diplomacy struggles to keep alive the viability of a two-state solution, three rival systems of control have crystallised in
the occupied territories that would make up a future Palestinian homeland: the settlements; the crimped Palestinian
Authority of Mr Abbas and Mr Fayyad; and then Hamas, which Israel and its Arab and western allies have tried and failed
to marginalise. Time is short for a negotiated outcome; it may even have run out.
The outlines of a deal are clear, in the (Bill) Clinton parameters of 2000 and Arab Peace initiative of 2002, endorsed by 22
Arab and 57 Muslim countries (as well as Hamas, as part of the 2007 Mecca accord). There has to be an end to the
occupation, and the US and Quartet cannot just allude to this; they must demand it.

Maybe. And, of course, worth the effort. Without an effort, the two state solution is dead; if failed, on the other hand, also
dead. Another idea, don't know if it can be made to work: How to introduce Israel entering the NPT and ending its nuclear
ambiguity, which is its state policy, but which itself is the model for Iran now. Can this issue be used profitably in
negotiations, a wild card, as it were? Can options be developed on whether it can, how it might work, potential effect on
peace process? Israel's nuclear ambiguity policy is certainly a big issue coming given Iran. See below from Haaretz today:

Interview / Why Israel should end its policy of
nuclear ambiguity
An interview with Avner Cohen, expert on nonproliferation
issues and author of the forthcoming book "The Worst-Kept
Secret: Israel's Bargain with the Bomb."
By Nia.
tasha Mozwvava Tags: Israel news
Avner Cohen is a senior fellow of the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute of
International Studies. He is the author of "Israel and the Bomb" and the forthcoming "The Worst-Kept Secret: Israel's
Bargain with the Bomb."
Avner Cohen, you claim that the time has come for Israel to abandon its policy of nuclear ambiguity. Why now,
and why would that be good for Israel?
"Nuclear ambiguity is a cornerstone of Israeli strategic thinking. It was born many years ago, and sealed as part of a
comprehensive deal with the United States in 1969. It was appropriate at the time, but today. in my opinion, it is not just
anachronistic, but foolish and anti-democratic. Even in realpolitik terms, it is an 'own goal' for Israel. In my view, it
undermines genuine Israeli interests, including the need to gain recognition and legitimacy and to be counted among the
responsible states in this strategic field."
Are you sure the pressure on Israel is so severe? If Israel is criticized over its nuclear program, its usually
marginal. The brunt of the criticism is over its treatment of the Palestinians. •
"Israel received tacit consent for its nuclear program from the Western world because it appeared to be a small, just state'
surrounded by enemies, and the memory of the Holocaust was still fresh. Israel's image was different then.
"In the long term, the more Israel appears to reject peace and to be the one that opposes a two-state solution, the more it
will be perceived as a regional bully that possesses nuclear weapons. So the world will be a lot less forgiving on the
nuclear issue. The situation of ambiguity, in which you don't have real legitimacy, is not a good place to be."
The United States has called on Israel to join the nonproliferation treaty, but during Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's visit to Washington, U.S. President Barack Obama said he recognizes the special nature of the
threats Israel faces, and these threats warrant special security measures.

The Americans want to appear just and fair because the issue is seen in Israel as completely sacred. They want to look
as though they respect that. This agreement [with the U.S.] has been passed along from president to president, but I don't
believe this issue is as sacred to Americans as it is to Israelis."
Do you give credence to the slippery slope theory, under which abandoning ambiguity would lead to demands
that Israel disarm?
"Those are cliches used by the defense establishment. Nobody 'demands that Israel make such an announcement without
first doing the preparatory work among its allies and the Arab states. This great fear of a slippery slope is ridiculous. Israel
has its own interests; nobody can coerce it to do things."
What about the claim that ambiguity is what keeps the Arab states from feeling a need to launch an arms race
against Israel?
"I don't dismiss that claim out of hand, and if, after study and thought, this fear turns out to be warranted, I would be
prepared to wait. But in some ways, ambiguity is insulting to the Arabs. The claim you mention treats Arabs as though
they were children: If they are told that Israel doesn't admit to it, that frees them of the need to deal with the reality. I
believe the Arab countries don't want to play a game of make-believe, but rather want to discuss the topic directly and
realistically."
You say, basically, that Iran is imitating Israel's nuclear behavior. That comparison would certainly rankle Israel
supporters.
"But the way Iran has advanced toward nuclear capability is not via announcements and tests, but rather by rumors. It can
even remain within the bounds of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. If that rankles anybody, let it rankle.
"If Iran is not attacked, it will want to achieve a status of ambiguity; I see this as nearly certain. The international
community thus has another reason not to accept the idea of ambiguity as legitimate. The norm that a state with a nuclear
weapon must say so clearly is part of the nonproliferation regime. The longer Iran continues down this path, the less
patience the world will have for Israel."
How do you envision the scenario of 'coming out of the nuclear closet?'
"Censorship plays a very central role in the enforcement of nuclear ambiguity. So long as there is a [military] censor, it is
very hard to alter ambiguity. If censorship didn't exist, israeli newspapers would be able to write about the subject more
openly.
"Another issue is the need for a law that addresses the nuclear topic. There is a Shin Bet [security service] law, but there
is no law for the Mossad and no law for the Israel Atomic Energy Commission. This is a very problematic situation.
"On the international level, it's a sensitive subject that demands preparatory work. Ultimately, I see a political statement by
Israel's government in which the prime minister would find the right way to put this subject on the table. He would talk
about the historical background and the responsible way Israel has dealt with this topic. With a few rare exceptions, these
weapons have no military use; Israel views them as a means of deterrence. I don't think Israel would need to go into detail
regarding how many [bombs] it has or exactly what it has.
"Israel has a right to the bomb no less than New Delhi, or even the United States. Ambiguity creates a sense that we are
sinners, as though we had done something so terrible that we can't tell the awful truth - and I don't think it is so awful. This
is a country that the world has viewed as a nuclear state for a long time, and the time has come for it to say something
positive on this huge, complicated and awe-inspiring topic...
"All these states are ultimately committed under the treaty they signed to achieve a world without nuclear weapons.
Whether that will happen in our lifetimes I can't say."
You say ambiguity undermines Israeli democracy and prevents debate on matters of life and death, such as the
question of whose finger will be on the button. Do you think the Israeli public is ready for such a discussion?
"There has been very little creative thinking in this area, and ambiguity is one of the stifling factors that have produced an
unacceptable, closed culture incapable of creative thinking. Ambiguity's power derives from the fact that Israeli society
accepts it, and it seems to the public that any attempt to deviate from it would cause serious damage to Israeli security.
"Ambiguity has created a public incapable of dealing with the topic, one that is afraid of it and prefers the issue to be
handled by 'trustworthy hands' so that it does not have to take responsibility itself.
Ambiguity has created an ignorant, craven public.which, in a certain sense, has betrayed its civic, democratic duties on
this subject."
What's it like researching a topic nobody discusses?
"When I started studying this subject 25 years ago, I had the feeling I was entering a palace where nothing could be
touched. It took me years to find the right way to handle the topic responsibly - from a researcher's perspective, not from
the standpoint of someone who is directly involved in the matter.
Today I think it is possible to initiate a meaningful dialogue about concrete, real issues."

A poisoned process holds little hope
By David Gardner
Published: August 25 2010 22:46 1 Last updated: August 25 2010 22:46
As the caravans of Middle East peace negotiators rumble into Washington next
week for the umpteenth time, the pervasive cynicism and sense of deja vu all
over again is overwhelming -.and with good reason.
The Middle East peace process long ago turned into a tortured charade of pure
process while events on the ground - in particular the relentless and strategic
Israeli colonisation of occupied Palestinian land. - pull in the opposite
direction to peace. "We have all been colluding in a gigantic confidence trick,"
is how one Arab minister puts it, "and here we go again."
While many factors had combined to hand veto powers to rejectionists on both
sides, the heart of the question remains the continuing Israeli occupation. ‘7"
is essential to remember that the biggest single increase of Jewish settlers on
Arab land - a 50 per cent rise - took place in 1992-96 under the governments of
peace-makers Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres at the high-water mark of the Oslo
peace accords. Many Israelis will point to the perfidy of the late Yassir
Arafat, who wanted to talk peace but keep the option of armed resistance

dangerously in play. But what killed Oslo was the occupation. The second
intifada that erupted a decade ago was essentially the Oslo war.
A decade on, the Israeli settlement enterprise has turned the occupied West Bank
into a discontiguous scattering of cantons, walled in by a security barrier
built on yet more annexed Arab land and criss-crossed by segregated Israeli
roads linking the settlements. Last month, B'Tselem, the Israeli human rights
group, published a study showing Israel has now taken 42 per cent of the West
Bank, with 300,000 settlers there and another 200,000 in East Jerusalem. The
siege of Gaza has turned that sliver of land into a vast, open-air prison.
The main feature of the present situation is the disconnect between the high
politics of the utterly discredited peace process and these - in Israeli
parlance - "facts on the ground".
At last month's White House summit, where Barack Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu .
massaged their long estrangement into a political armistice, the US president
praised the Israeli prime minister as a leader "willing to take risks for
peace".
But there is no evidence for this whatsoever. True, in June last year, in
response to Mr Obama's Cairo speech denying any legitimacy to Israel's
settlements, Mr Netanyahu forced himself to utter the words "Palestinian state"
- but he surrounded them with barbed-wire caveats that voided them of meaning.
Indeed, the words all sides use - peace, resolution, security, and so on - may

be the same; but what each side means by them is different.
The mainstream Palestinian leaders, President Mahmoud Abbas and Salam Fayyad,
the prime minister, and the Quartet made up of the US, the European Union, the
UN and Russia, talk of a negotiated resolution. This means two states living in
peace and security, and a Palestinian homeland on the 22 per cent of Mandate
Palestine taken by Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. East Jerusalem would
serve as the capital of the West Bank and Gaza, with marginal land swaps to
preserve some Israeli settlements near Jerusalem. But what does Mr Netanyahu
mean?
He has been most clear on what he does not mean. For a start, he has set his
face—against any concessions on Jerusalem. He wants to .keep most settlements
except for the far-flung "ideological" ones and the 100-plus "outposts"
established as pawns to be traded once the chess game began. His idea of a
demilitarised Palestinian state is more like a sort of supra-municipal
administration than a self-determined, independent government.
Will he surprise us, on the hackneyed Nixon and China principle that holds it is
politicians of the right who most easily close difficult deals? There is little
to suggest that.
The thinking of Mr Netanyahu, son of a celebrated promoter of Greater Israel,
has always been profoundly irredentist. While his nationalist Likud faces the
constraints of being in coalition with an assortment of ultra-rightist and
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771423 Date: 08/31/2015

ultra-orthodox parties as well as Labour, that was plainly his choice; the
centrist Kadima party was (and remains) an alternative. To be fair, Israel's
electoral system - with a low threshold for entry into the Knesset that makes
multi-party coalitions inevitable - means lObbies such as the settlers can take
the national interest hostage. But Mr Netanyahu magnifies this by his choice of
partners and by diligently firing up the ultra-hawks in the pro-Israel lobby in
the US.
As risks he has taken for peace, Exhibit A is the much-hyped moratorium on
settlement-building, which expires next month and has, in any case, been
speciously interpreted. While the bulldozers to build settlements have been
idling, moreover, the bulldozers demolishing Palestinian homes have been
roaring: the rate of demolition in and around Jerusalem has doubled this year,
while the army has lust razed the village of al-Farisiye in the Jordan Valley,
in line with Mr Netanyahu's strategically obsolete obsession with keeping the
valley as Israel's eastern border.
As diplomacy struggles to keep alive the viability of a two-state solution,
three rival systems of control have crystallised in the occupied territories
that would make up a future Palestinian homeland: the settlements; the crimped.
Palestinian Authority of Mr Abbas and Mr Fayyad; and then Hamas, which Israel
and its Arab and western allies have tried and failed to marginalise. Time is
short for a negotiated outcome; it may even have run out.

The outlines of a deal are clear, in the (Bill) Clinton parameters of 2000 and
'Arab Peace Initiative of 2002, endorsed by 22 Arab and 57 Muslim countries (as
well as Hamas, as part of the 2007 Mecca accord). There has to be an end to the
occupation, and the US and Quartet cannot just allude to this; they must demand
it.

Europe's New Politics of Fear
by Denis MacShaneApril 16, 2010
There is a new divide in Europe. Not an iron curtain, but an iron intolerance as politicians revert to blaming minorities for
their nations' woes. In Western Europe it is Muslims. In Eastern Europe they are Jews, Roma, and gays. In the
Netherlands, Geert Wilders surged to an election victory in March on the back of anti-Muslim, anti-Quran populism. In
Hungary the Fidesz Party won big in recent elections with attacks on "Jewish capital... which wants to devour the entire
world." To the right of Fidesz is the openly anti-Jewish Jobbik Party, which won just two seats fewer than the Socialists. Its
leaders want to wear the neo-Nazi uniform of the pre-1939 Hungarian Guard when they take their seats in Budapest's
Parliament.
Contemporary political scientists do not like to highlight anti-Semitism. They prefer the term "radical populism," but to
anyone with half a sense of European history, the parallels with an older, Jew-baiting politics can no longer be dismissed.
Economic dislocation and a rapid loss of confidence in traditional politics gave rise to ultranationalist movements in the
first half of the last century. Now a global recession and the hunt for someone to blame as jobs and incomes disappear is
producing the same toxic politics.
The Fidesz leader, Viktor Orban, was a youthful evangelist for liberalized open markets after 1990. Now he strikes a much
more nationalist tone. His Socialist opponents had to accept an austerity IMF package. Unlike Greece—which is being
helped, so far, by its euro-zone partners—Hungary was alone as boom-time euro loans to buy houses and cars had to be
paid back in an ever-devaluing forint. Blaming the Socialist government, globalization, and international capital was easy.
But Fidesz went further. In a bid for votes on the far right, a Fidesz parliamentarian, Oszkar Molnar, says it's time to give
"primacy to Hungarian interests over those of global capital, Jewish capital."
Like Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front in France, Jobbik has the support of about 15 percent of Hungarian voters. The
Czech right-wing ODS Party has had to dismiss its leader, former premier Mirek Topolanek, after he attacked the Jewish
origins of the current Czech prime minister and castigated the gay transport minister. In a new book, The Populist Radical
Right in Poland, the Oxford-educated Warsaw political professor Rafal Pankowski writes: "Antisemitism is crucial to the
Polish populist right. The number of Jews in Poland today is minimal, but the anti-Jewish prejudice serves as a code for a
general hostility to diversity and to Polish [liberal] democracy." For the time being, criticism of nationalist politics is
suspended as Poles mourn President Lech Kaczynski and other national leaders killed in the air-crash tragedy this month.
But the record of his party activists—including Michal Kaminski, Poland's best-known M.E.P. and leader of a small right-
wing group in the Strasbourg Parliament—is disturbing. An admirer of the late Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet,
Kaminski uses ugly language about gays, and says he will apologize for the killing of Jews on Polish soil in World War II
when "Jews apologize for killing Poles."
Mainstream political parties have sought to play down the rise of minority bashing. But Fidesz is affiliated with the center-
right European People's Party, which groups Angela Merkel's ruling Christian Democratic Union Party in Germany,
Nicolas Sarkozy's Union for a Popular Movement government in France, and ruling conservative parties in Sweden, Italy,
and Belgium. When Austrian rightist Jorg Haider entered a coalition in Austria a decade ago, the European Union held
Vienna in a political quarantine until Haider was removed. But Fidesz has a massive majority built on attacking "Jewish
capital" in language even Haider didn't dare utter.
So radical populism—anti-Muslim in Western Europe, anti-Jewish in Eastern Europe, and anti-foreigner and anti-
immigrant rhetoric everywhere—is no longer fringe politics. In Britain's general election, all the main parties are seeking to
appease anti-foreigner feeling with language on immigrants that they would not tolerate if applied to British citizens living
and working abroad. Comparisons with prewar Europe should not be overdrawn. Fascism is dead and not coming back.
But a new politics of intolerance is afoot in Europe, and no one knows how to deal with it.

What a Tea Party Looks Like in Europe
Marine Le Pen is moving her father's rabble-rousing, far-right
party away from the fringe, and redefining French politics in
the process.
by Tracy McNicoll and Christopher DickeySeptember 05, 2010
amuel Bollendorff / The New York Times-Redux
Marine Le Pen is the heir apparent to the leadership of the National Front, the right-wing party her father Jean-Marie (left)
leads today
Jean-Marie Le Pen, the 82-year-old firebrand of France's far right—the man who for decades has played on the inchoate
fears, xenophobia, knee-jerk racism, and ill-disguised anti-Semitism of many of his supporters—had just finished speaking
to the faithful on a farm not far from the English Channel. As members of the youth wing of his National Front party
feasted on barbecue and apple pie, they were thrilled to see the grand old man hold forth, still the "provocateur" taunting
the establishment, the "toreador" who hides the sword in his cape and lets the press run at him like a bull. Even these
youngsters knew, however, that Jean-Marie's time in the ring is nearing an end. The old man himself made it clear he's.
determined to step down. All eyes this day were on his daughter Marine. "She has the will, the courage, the temperament
necessary, and the competence," Le Pen told reporters at the farmhouse. "It seems to me indisputable that she is our
camp's best candidate for 2012."
Tall, blonde, plain-spoken, and thick-skinned, Le Pen's youngest child, at 42, is the heir apparent to his party. She's
expected to win the contest for its leadership in January, and she's a passionate advocate of its core message: strong
French nationalism, relentless Euro-skepticism, and a lot of hard-nosed talk about fighting crime and immigration. She's a
fresh face, a new look, and, with rising poll numbers placing her third in a crowded field of possible 2012 candidates, a
new threat in French politics. In the eyes of many, she's more effective—and thus more dangerous—than her father.
It's a measure of the Le Pens' enhanced power that they've managed to push President Nicolas Sarkozy to the right and
cast their own party as mainstream. Over the summer, Sarkozy essentially gave up his flirtation with the left, which began
after his election in 2007. He had cherry-picked popular Socialists for his centrist government, dividing their party. But in
elections this past March, Sarkozy's UMP party managed to keep control of only one out of 22 regional governments. So
he decided to swing back to the right by playing on fears about public safety and immigration. He proposed taking
citizenship away from some criminals of immigrant background and launched a campaign against Roma (or "Gypsies"),
booting hundreds out of the country. While the measures proved popular in opinion polls, Sarkozy, ironically, did not. His
abysmal approval ratings remain in the low 30s.
The younger Le Pen takes great pleasure in watching Sarkozy squirm. "I think I get on [his] nerves quite a bit," she says.
"My profile is much more complicated for him to deal with than that of my father." The old man could be painted as a
creature of the past, a purveyor of old prejudices with a "sulfurous" reputation, says Marine. Today, however, the Front
wants to bill itself as "neither left nor right." If that means losing some fringe elements (many of whom support Marine's
rival, Bruno Gollnisch), well, "tent pis," she says.
Other right-wing movements in Europe are also pushing into the political mainstream. The government of Prime Minister
Silvio Berlusconi in Italy has long relied on its alliance with two groups that used to be considered extreme—one of them
the former Fascist Party under Gianfranco Fini, the other the secessionist Northern League of Umberto Bossi. A falling-out
between Berlusconi and Fini has left Bossi as the current kingmaker in Italian politics. In the Netherlands, the militantly
Islamophobic Geert Wilders won enough seats in the last elections to become a pivotal figure in the drawn-out process of
trying to build a new coalition government.
Yet these movements often differ in significant ways from the right wing that's made in the U.S.A. Put aside the usual
caricature of "people in pointy hoods and the Ku Klux Klan," Marine Le Pen says, and she still believes "the American right
is much more to the right than the National Front." She might agree with those who want to manage American frontiers
more effectively and prevent massive illegal immigration, but she's also a big believer in the state's ability and obligation
to help its people. "We feel the state should have the means to intervene," she says. "We are very attached to public
services A la frangaise as a way to limit the inequalities among regions and among the French," including "access for all to
the same level of health care."
Le Pen grew up in a household that was all politics all the time, with her father the object of sometimes violent attacks by
competing factions on the right, as well as by the left. When Marine was just 8, someone set off a 20-kilo bomb in the
family's Paris apartment building. Miraculously, no one was killed or seriously injured, but the front of the building was
brought down. The crime has never been solved. "The worst part wasn't just the attack, it was that not a single politician
sent a word of condolence," she says. "It was difficult, but it builds character, it hardens you."

That's a real asset in political life anywhere. If Sarkozy finds himself facing off against Marine Le Pen in the presidential
race a year and a half from now, he may find himself wishing her old man had stayed around a little longer.

November 22, 2010 - American Voters Could Deny Obama Reelection, Quinnipiac University National
Poll Finds; President Tied With Romney, Huckabee But Leads Palin
Word format
President Barack Obama does not deserve a second term, American voters say 49 - 43 percent, and he is in a
statistical dead heat with possible Republican challengers Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee, according to a
Quinnipiac University poll released today. President Obama leads Sarah Palin 48 - 40 percent.
Romney, Huckabee, Palin and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich are bunched together when Republican
voters are asked who they prefer for the GOP's 2012 presidential nomination, the independent Quinnipiac
(KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University survey finds.
Democratic voters say 64 - 27 percent they do not want anyone to challenge President Obama for their party's
nomination in 2012.
"The Democratic base remains squarely behind President Barack Obama when it comes to his re-election, but
his weakness among independent voters at this point makes his 2012 election prospects uncertain," said Peter
A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771526 Date: 08/31/2015
"The demographic splits in the electorate when voters are asked whether the president deserves a second term is
a roadmap for his re-election strategists on how they need to focus their appeal. Only 39 percent of men, 34
percent of whites, 35 percent of political independents and 38 percent of those over age 35 think he deserves
four more years in the Oval Office."
In trial heats for 2012, former Massachusetts Gov. Romney receives 45 percent to 44 percent for Obama, while
the president gets 46 percent to 44 percent for Mr. Huckabee. Matched against Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, a
virtual unknown to most voters, the president leads 45 - 36 percent.
"At this point, former Alaska Gov. Palin runs the worst against President Obama. Daniels is essentially a
generic Republican because of his anonymity to most voters. Obama only gets 45 percent against him while he
gets 48 percent against Ms. Palin," said Brown. "She is very unpopular among independents and although she
recently said she thought she could defeat Obama, the data does not now necessarily support that assertion."
"Unlike Daniels, who is a political unknown to most Americans, virtually all voters have formed an opinion
about Palin and that opinion is not encouraging for her candidacy."
Ms. Palin is viewed the most negatively by the American people of the possible Republican candidates in 2012.
She is viewed unfavorable by 51 percent of voters and favorably by 36 percent. Among independents, the key
swing voting bloc, she has a negative 54 - 33 percent favorability rating.
Huckabee gets a 41 - 25 percent favorability rating and Romney gets a 38 - 26 percent score. Former U.S.
House Speaker Newt Gingrich gets a negative 30 - 43 percent score.
Obama gets a 48 - 48 percent split overall, with a negative 43 - 52 percent among independent voters.
In a mythical Republican primary Ms. Palin gets 19 percent, including 25 percent of GOP women, followed by
Romney with 18 percent, Huckabee at 17 percent, Gingrich at 15 percent, Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty at 6
percent and Daniels, Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour and Sen. John Thune of South Dakota at 2 percent each.
"The best thing Obama has going for him when it comes to his re-election may be that at this point the
Republicans don't have a candidate who is both nationally well-known and well- liked by a majority of voters,"

1. (Republicans and Republican Leaners) It is a long way off but I would like to ask you some questions about

candidates were: Sarah Palin, Mike Huckabee, Newt Gingrich, Mitt Romney, Mitch Daniels, Tim Pawlenty,
Haley Barbour, and John Thune for whom would you vote?

November 23, 2010
Effort for Liberal Balance to G.O.P. Groups
Begins
By MICHAEL LUO
In what may prove a significant development for the 2012 elections, David Brock, a prominent Democratic political
operative, says he has amassed $4 million in pledges over the last few weeks and is moving quickly to hire a staff to set
up what he hopes will become a permanent liberal counterweight over the airwaves to the Republican-leaning outside
groups that spent so heavily on this year's midterm elections.
Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, a former Maryland lieutenant governor and the eldest of Robert F. Kennedy's 11 children,
has agreed to serve as the chairwoman of the group, which will be called American Bridge, lending to the still extremely
nascent undertaking the weight of what remains one of the most significant families in Democratic politics.
Leading Democratic donors who have already pledged money to the group include Rob McKay, heir to the Taco Bell
fortune and chairman of the Democracy Alliance, a partnership of wealthy liberal donors; Robert Dyson, who heads
Dyson-Kissner-Moran, a takeover and acquisitions firm in New York City; and Marcia L. Carsey, a television producer who
gave $1 million to Democratic outside groups in 2004.
Mr. Brock said in an interview that he planned to formally file papers with the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday to
set up American Bridge as what is known as an independent-expenditure-only political action committee, meaning it will
be able to take in contributions of unlimited size from individuals and corporations but must regularly disclose its donors.
Certain to set off debate, however, is that Mr. Brock appears to be positioning his new organization so that fund-raising
consultants can raise money for Democratic-oriented media efforts not just through American Bridge but also via one of
the nonprofit organizations Mr. Brock currently runs, Media Matters Action Network, which does not disclose its donors.
The action network, which tracks conservative politicians and advocacy organizations, is organized as a 501(c)(4)
nonprofit group and is set to take on an expanded role in the 2012 elections, including potentially running television ads,
according to an internal draft concept paper about American Bridge's and Media Matter Action Network's plans obtained
by The New York Times.
Mr. Brock said that "money is money," and that he would actively solicit donors for both entities and, in the end, the media
spending would be apportioned accordingly.
The moves by Mr. Brock in recent weeks make his the most concrete effort so far on the part of Democratic activists to
establish some kind of centralized structure that they hope will become the left's answer in 2012 to such groups on the
right as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, American Crossroads and others, which significantly outspent Democratic-
leaning outside groups this year. It is too early to say whether Mr. Brock's group will emerge as the go-to vehicle for giant
contributions on the left.
Mr. Brock led a much-heralded independent group in the 2008 presidential election that failed to gain much traction after
the Obama campaign indicated that it preferred that donors not give to such groups.
But Mr. Brock, a former conservative journalist who publicly disavowed the right in the late 1990s, is a respected political
player, who has drawn plaudits from liberal donors for his running of the array of groups under the Media Matters
umbrella.
Mr. Brock pointed out that the various groups associated with Media Matters had raised a combined $23 million this year.
Its backers include major Democratic donors like George Soros, the billionaire who recently announced he had given $1

million to the group; Peter B. Lewis, the billionaire chairman of Progressive Insurance, who, like Mr. Soros, gave more
than $20 million to Democratic-oriented groups in 2004; and the Hollywood producer Steve Bing.
"My donor base already constitutes the major individual players who have historically given hundreds of millions of dollars
to these types of efforts," Mr. Brock said. "They just need to be asked, and I have no doubt they will step up at this critical
time."
There also seems to be widespread agreement among Democratic activists and donors on the need for such groups to be
more heavily involved in the 2012 elections.
White House officials have signaled in recent weeks that the Obama administration would not object to Democratic-
leaning outside groups getting involved in the 2012 elections, a change from the Obama campaign's attitude toward such
groups in 2008. But they have also indicated that they would prefer that the names of donors be disclosed.
The lack of disclosure among Republican-leaning outside groups became a central Democratic talking point this year as
spending by outside groups on the right exploded before the midterm elections.
But the overriding desire on the part of liberal donors and activists to hold on to the White House and to win back some of
what was lost in the House and Senate may trump those principles. Most political operatives agree that it is easier to raise
money if the option of offering anonymity is available.
"It would be sort of a funny principle to stand on, to essentially tie one hand behind your back," Mr. McKay said.
Besides Mr. Brock, numerous Democratic activists have been in discussions about setting up similar independent efforts.
On Monday, for instance, Steve Rosenthal, who was the chief executive of America Coming Together, a Democratic fund-
raising vehicle that focused on voter mobilization in the 2004 election, convened a group of political operatives, many of
whom were active in that election, at a Washington restaurant to discuss what might be done for 2012.
No one, however, has apparently gone as far as Mr. Brock in terms of raising money and formally setting up an
organization.
Mr. Brock said the $4 million in pledges the group has collected so far should be deposited in its bank account by the end
of the first quarter of 2011.
By way of comparison, America's Families First Action Fund, one of the major Democratic independent efforts in House
races this year, raised just over $4 million for the entire cycle up until mid-October.
The internal concept paper for American Bridge lays out a series of priorities for the next year, including initially focusing
on attacking vulnerable Republicans in the Senate and the House, as a prelude to major spending in 2012.

US Election And The Fed
Welcome To The New (Old) World
September 19, 2010
One of the main debates inside senior Fed offices is how much they may have to balance a much more
conservative fiscal policy if the Republicans take over. This is the most important question facing officials
on both sides of the fence (far more than squiggles and whirls of monthly numbers).
But it's not just spending and taxes, important as they are, it's also implementation of Reg Reform and
Health Care Reform. All of that is going to change after November. Here are the details.
Amid the snarkiness about how crazy the Tea Party candidates may be (and, as you know, we LOVE
snarkiness) two things should not be lost:
1. The President has lost control of the spending and tax agenda
2. The President has lost control of implementing the Reg Reform and health care
legislation Congress pushed through.
All polling from both parties and independent sources point strongly to the Republicans taking over the
House. Although they are less likely to take over the Senate, they will be able to gain effective control of
spending, taxes and large scale administrative reforms.
Let's start with spending:
The basic fact is that all spending has to be approved by Congress and it starts with the House. As we
wrote nearly a week ago, House Republican Leader Boehner and his senior staff have made it clear to us
that they would like to freeze spending at 2008 levels with an annual cost savings of $340 billion. This will
be one of the top Republican priorities.
Freezing spending at 2008 levels will not happen. However, even in the unlikely event the Republicans do
not take over the House the budget will -- at most -- be frozen at or near FY 2010 levels (i.e. the last time
money was formally appropriated).
Since there have been no spending bills approved and the fiscal year starts in October, the Congress has
to pass a "continuing resolution" that keeps the government running until specific appropriations are made
(the 1995 government shutdown happened because there were no appropriations and no continuing
resolution...the government literally runs out of spending authority).
Congress will pass a CR in the next few weeks and it will most likely run through the formation of the new
Congress (say February or March) next year. They could only do it through the lame duck session, but
that would be cutting it close and too cute.
Because the new Congress - even if the Republicans fail to take full control of the House - will be
dominated by fiscal conservatives, Boehner's CR idea will have traction. The Senate will make it more
moderate, but then it will be up to the President to veto it and thus shut down government or sign it and
take the hit.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771695 Date: 08/31/2015
In turn that does two things: (1) it frees up money for the Bush tax rollovers and (2) it helps the plan to
slow or freeze implementation of the reg reform and health care reform bills.
The first part is obvious. The second may be less so. People forget that implementation of these rules
requires staff increases, staff reg writing, etc and that's money. By freezing spending at previous levels
you freeze the ability to hire new staff and you seriously obstruct the new rule writing process.
Add to that Boehner's commitment to overturn the two major regulatory reforms and you've got a tidal
wave of indecision and paralysis (Jesus, talk about mixed metaphors although it would be interesting to
see one of those).
The hearings he will announce and simply the chilling effect of him threatening to overturn the laws will
accomplish ninety-percent of what he wants to get done, and potentially give the courts time to strike
down parts of the health care bill now under appeal.
THE SENATE
While everyone has written off Republican control of the Senate (we haven't), the attention should be on
what the Senate will look like even if the consensus of 52-54 Democratic majority prevails.
The point is how the US Senate will function in January 2011 given its new membership. We got a
glimpse of what this would look like when moderate Republican Scott Brown was elected and the health
care public option was panned and Reg Reform was trimmed around the edges.
The incoming crop of members are much more ardent on government spending, the debt, taxes and
regulatory oversight. They will make Boehner's job much easier
Take a quick look at the new members (and the several they will marry up with once they are sworn into
office).
While some of these candidates are replacing Republican open seats, all of them are generally considered
more conservative than their predecessors:
1. ck (CO) - likely winner
2. Toomey (PA) - likely winner
3. Rubio (FL) - likely winner
4. Ayotte (NH) - likely winner
5. Blunt (MO) - likely winner
6. Portman (OH) -likely winner
7. Coats (IN) - likely winner
8. Paul (KY) - likely winner
9. Miller (AK) - likely winner
10. Lee (UT) - likely winner
11. Boozman (AR) - likely winner
12. Hoeven (ND) - likely winner
13. Kirk (IL) - 50/50 (lean GOP)
14. Angle (NV) - 50/50 tossup
There are several other Democrat-controlled seats that remain in play (CA, WI, WA, and CT). These races
continue to develop and we will report more as the picture on Election Day becomes clearer.
These likely new members will join the following traditional budget trouble-makers in the US Senate:
1. DeMint (SC)
2. Coburn (OK)
3. Inhofe (OK)
4. McConnell (KY)
5. Kyl (AZ)
6. McCain (AZ)
7. Thune (SD)

10. Burr (NC)
One aggressive Senator can slow the body to a snail's pace, and Republicans operated efficiently as a
minority party with only 41 votes total. In January, there will be at least 22 new and existing serious road
blocks now patrolling the Senate Floor. The Republican pick-ups will make getting to 60 votes for cloture
impossible on spending bills.
Welcome to the new reality.

A REPORTER AT 1.ARGE
COVERT OPERATIONS
The billionaire brothers who are waging a war against Obama.
by Jane Mayetmo,
(.s..
David H. Koch in 1996. He and his brother Charles are lifelong libertarians and have quietly given more than a hundred million
dollars to right-wing causes.
On May 17th, a black-tie audience at the Metropolitan Opera House applauded as a tall, jovial-looking billionaire tOok the
stage. It was the seventieth annual spring gala of American Ballet Theatre, and David H. Koch was being celebrated for his
generosity as a member of the board of trustees; he had recently donated $2.5 million toward the company's upcoming season,
and had given many millions before that. Koch received an award while flanked by two of the gala's co-chairs, Blaine Trump,
in a peach-colored gown, and Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, in emerald green. Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis, had been a patron of the ballet and, coincidentally, the previous owner of a Fifth Avenue apartment that Koch had
bought, in 1995, and then sold, eleven years later, for thirty-two million dollars, having found it too small.
The gala marked the social ascent of Koch, who, at the age of seventy, has become one of the city's most prominent
philanthropists. In 2008, he donated a hundred million dollars to modernize. Lincoln Center's New York State Theatre building,
which now bears his name. He has given twenty million to the American Museum of Natural History, whose dinosaur wing is
named for him. This spring, after noticing the decrepit state of the fountains outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Koch
pledged at least ten million dollars for their renovation. He is a trustee of the museum, perhaps the most coveted social prize in

the city, and serves on the board of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, where, after he donated more than forty million
dollars, an endowed chair and a research center were named for him.
One dignitary was conspicuously absent from the gala: the event's third honorary co-chair, Michelle Obama. Her office
said that a scheduling conflict had prevented her from attending. Yet had the First Lady shared the stage with Koch it might
have created an awkward tableau. In Washington, Koch is best known as part of a family that has repeatedly funded stealth
attacks on the federal government, and on the Obama Administration in particular.
With his brother Charles, who is seventy-four, David Koch owns virtually all of Koch Industries, a conglomerate,
headquartered in Wichita. Kansas, whose annual revenues are estimated to be a hundred billion dollars. The company has
grown spectacularly since their father, Fred, died, in 1967, and the brothers took charge. The Kochs operate oil refineries in
Alaska, Texas, and Minnesota, and control some four thousand miles of pipeline. Koch Industries owns Brawny paper towels,
Dixie. cups, Georgia-Pacific lumber, Staimnaster carpet, and Lycra, among other products. Forbes ranks it as the second-largest
private company in the country, after Cargill, and its consistent profitability has made David and Charles Koch—who, years
ago, bought out two other brothers—among the richest Men in America. Their combined fortune of thirty-five billion dollars is
exceeded only by those of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett.
The Kochs are longtime libertarians who believe in drastically lower personal and corporate taxes, minimal social services
for the needy, and much less oversight of industry—especially environmental regulation. These views dovetail with the
brothers' corporate interests. In a study released this spring, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst's Political Economy
Research Institute named Koch Industries one of the top ten air polluters in the United States.- And Greenpeace issued a report
identifying the company as a "kingpin of climate science denial." The report showed that, from 2005 to 2008, the Kochs vastly
outdid ExxonMobil in giving money to organizations fighting legislation related to climate change, unclerwriting'a huge
network of foundations, think tanks, and political front groups. Indeed, the brothers have funded opposition campaigns against
so many Obama Administration policies—from health-care reform to the economic-stimulus program----that, in political circles,
their ideological network is known as the Kochtopus.
In a statement, Koch Industries said that the Greenpeace report "distorts the environmental record of our companies." And. .
David Koch, in a recent, admiring article about him in New York, protested that the "radical press" had turned his family into
"whipping boys," and had exaggerated its influence on American politics. But Charles Lewis, the founder of the Center for
Public Integrity, a nonpartisan watchdog group, said, "The Kochs are on a whole different level. There's no one else who has
spent this much money. The sheer dimension of it is what sets them apart. They have a pattern of lawbreaking, political
manipulation, and obfuscation. I've been in Washington since Watergate, and I've never seen anything like it. They are the
Standard Oil of our times."
few weeks after the Lincoln Center gala, the advocacy wing of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation—an organization that
David Koch started, in 2004—held a different kind of gathering. Over the July 4th weekend, a summit called Texas Defending
the American Dream took place in a chilly hotel ballroom in Austin. Though Koch freely promotes his philanthropic ventures,
lie did not attend the summit, and his name was not in evidence. And on this occasion the audience was roused not by a,dance
performance but by a series of speakers denouncing President Barack Obama. Peggy Venable, the organizer of the summit,
warned that Administration officials "have a socialist visiOn for this country."
Five hundred people attended the summit, which served, in part, as a training session for Tea Party activists in Texas. An
advertisement cast the event as a populist uprising against vested corporate power. "Today, the voices of average Americans are
being drowned out by lobbyists and special interests," it said. "But you can do something about it." The pitch made no mention
of its corporate funders. The White House has expressed frustration that such sponsors have largely eluded public notice. David .
Axelrod, Obama's senior adviser, said, "What they don't say is that, in part, this is a grassroots citizens' movement brought to
you by a bunch of oil billionaires."
In April, 2009, Melissa Cohlmia, a company spokesperson; denied that the Kochs had direct links to the Tea Party, saying
that Americans for Prosperity is "an independent organization and Koch companies do not in any way direct their activities."
.Later, she issued a statement: "No funding has been provided by Koch companies, the Koch foundations, or Charles Koch or
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
David Koch specifically to support the tea parties." David Koch told New York, "I've never been to a tea-party event. No one
representing the tea party has ever even approached me."
At the lectern in Austin, however, Venable—a longtime political operative who draws a salary from Americans for
Prosperity, and who has worked for Koch-funded political groups since 1994—spoke less warily: "We love what the Tea
Parties are doing, because that's how we're going to take back America!" she declared, as the crowd cheered. In a subsequent
interview, she described herself as an early member of the movement, joking, "I was part of the Tea Party before it was cool!"
She explained that the role of Americans for Prosperity was to help "educate" Tea Party activists on policy details, and to give
them "next-step training" after their rallies, so that their political energy could be channelled "more effectively." And she noted
that Americans for Prosperity had provided Tea Party activists with lists of elected officials to target. She said of the Kochs.
"They're certainly our people. David's the chairman of our board. I've certainly met with them, and I'm very appreciative Of
what they do."
Venable honored several Tea Party "citizen leaders" at the summit. The Texas branch of Americans for Prosperity gave its
Blogger of the Year Award to a young woman named Sibyl West. On June 14th, West, writing on her site, described Obama as
the "cokehead in chief." In an online thread, West speculated that the President was exhibiting symptoms of "demonic
possession (aka schizophrenia, etc.)." The summit featured several paid speakers, including Janine Turner, the actress best
known for her role on the television series "Northern Exposure." She declared, "They don't want our children to know about
their rights. They don't want our children to know about a God!"
During a catered lunch, Venable introduced Ted Cruz, a former solicitor general of Texas, who told the crowd that Obama
was "the most radical President ever to occupy the Oval Office," and had hidden from voters a secret agenda—"the government
taking over our economy and our lives." Countering Obama, Cruz proclaimed, was the epic fight of our generation!" As the
crowd rose to its feet and cheered, he quoted the defiant words of a Texan at the Alamo: "Victory, or death!"
Americans for Prosperity has worked closely with the Tea Party since the movement's inception. In the weeks before the
first Tax Day protests, in April, 2009, Americans for Prosperity hosted a Web site offering supporters "Tea Party Talking
Points." The Arizona branch urged people to send tea bags to Obama; the Missouri branch urged members to sign up for
"Taxpayer Tea Party Registration" and provided directions to nine protests. The group continues to stoke the rebellion. The
North Carolina branch recently launched a "Tea Party Finder" Web site, advertised as "a hub for all the Tea Parties in North
Carolina."
The anti-government fervor infusing the 2010 elections represents a political triumph for the Kochs. By giving money to
"educate," fund, and organize Tea Party protesters, they have helped turn their private agenda into a mass movement. Bruce
Bartlett, a conservative economist and a historian, who once worked at the National Center for Policy Analysis, a Dallas-based
think tank that the Kochs fund, said, "The problem with the whole libertarian movement is that it's been all chiefs and no
Indians. There haven't been any actual people, like voters, who give a crap about it. So the problem for the Kochs has been
trying to create a movement." With the emergence of the Tea Party, he said, "everyone suddenly sees that for the first time there
are Indians out there—people who can provide real ideological power." The Kochs, he said, are "trying to shape and control and
channel the populist uprising into their own policies."-
A Republican campaign consultant who has done research on behalf of Charles and David Koch said of the Tea Party, "The
Koch brothers gave the money that founded it. It's like they put the seeds in the ground. Then the rainstorm comes, and the
frogs come out of the mud—and they're our candidates!"
The Kochs and their political operatives declined requests for interviews. Instead, a prominent New York public-relations
executive who is close with the Kochs put forward two friends: George Pataki, the former governor of New York, and Mortimer
Zuckerman, the publisher and real-estate magnate. Pataki, a Republican who received campaign donations from David Koch,
called him "a patriot who cares deeply about his country." Zuckerman praised David's "gentle decency" and the "range of his
public interests."
The Republican campaign consultant said of the family's political activities, "To call them under the radar is an
understatement. They are underground!" Another former Koch adviser said, "They're smart. This right-wing, redneck stuff
works for them. They see this as a way to get things done without getting dirty themselves." Rob Stein, a Democratic political

strategist who has studied the conservative movement's finances, said that the Kochs are "at the epicenter of the anti-Obama
movement. But it's not just about Obama. They would have done the same to Hillary Clinton. They did the same with Bill •
Clinton. They are out to destroy progressivism."
ddly enough, the fiercely capitalist Koch family owes part of its fortune to Joseph Stalin. Fred Koch was the son of a Dutch
printer who settled in Texas and ran a weekly newspaper. Fred attended M.I.T., where he earned a degree in chemical
engineering. In 1927, he invented a more efficient process for converting oil into gasoline; but, according to family lore,
America's major oil companies regarded him as a threat and shut him out of the industry. Unable to succeed at home, Koch
found work in the Soviet Union. In the nineteen-thirties, his company trained Bolshevik engineers and helped Stalin's regime
set up fifteen modern oil refineries. Over time, however, Stalin brutally purged several of Koch's Soviet colleagues. Koch was
deeply affected by the experience, and regretted his collaboration. He returned to the U.S. In the headquarters of his company,
Rock Island Oil & Refining, in Wichita, he kept photographs aimed at proving that some of those Soviet refineries had been
destroyed in the Second World War. Gus diZerega, a former friend of Charles Koch, recalled, "As the Soviets became a
stronger military power, Fred felt a certain amount of guilt at having helped build them up. I think it bothered him a lot."
In 1958, Fred Koch became one of the original members of the john Birch Society, the arch-conservative group known, in
part, for a highly skeptical view of governance and for spreading fears of a Communist takeover. Members considered President
Dwight D. Eisenhower to be a Communist agent. In a self-published broadside, Koch claimed that the Communists have
infiltrated both the Democrat and Republican Parties." He wrote admiringly of Benito Mussolini's suppression of Communists
in Italy, and disparagingly of the American civil-rights movement. "The colored man looms large in the Communist plan to take
over America," he warned. Welfare was a secret plot to attract rural blacks to cities, where they would foment "a vicious race
war." In a 1963 speech that prefigures the Tea Party's talk of a secret 'socialist plot, Koch predicted that Communists would
"infiltrate the highest offices of government in the U.S. until the President is a Communist, unknown to the rest of us."
Koch married Mary Robinson, the daughter of a Missouri physician, and they had four sons: Freddie, Charles, and twins,
David and William. John Damgard, the president of the Futures Industry Association, was David's schoolmate and friend. He
recalled that Fred Koch was "a real John Wayne type." Koch emphasized rugged pursuits, taking his sons big-game hunting in
Africa, and requiring them to do farm labor at the family ranch. The Kochs lived in a stone mansion on a large compound across
from Wichita's country club; in the summer, the boys could hear their friends splashing in the pool, but they were not allowed
to join them. "By instilling a work ethie in me at an early age, my father did me a big favor, although it didn't seem like a favor
back then," Charles has written. "By the time I was eight, he made sure work occupied most of my spare time." David Koch
recalled that his father also indoctrinated the boys politically. "He was constantly speaking to us children about what was wrong
with government," he told Brian Doherty, an editor of the libertarian magazine Reason, and the author of "Radicals for
Capitalism," a 2007 history of the libertarian movement. "It's something I grew up with—a fundamental point of view that big
government was bad, and imposition of government controls on our lives and economic fortunes was not good."
David attended Deerfield Academy, in Massachusetts, and Charles was sent to military school. Charles, David, and William
all earned engineering degrees at their father's alma mater, M.I.T., and later joined the family company. Charles eventually
assumed control, with David as his deputy; William's career at the company was less successful. Freddie went to Harvard and
studied playwriting at the Yale School of Drama. His father reportedly disapproved of him, and punished him financially.
(Freddie, through a spokesperson, denied this:)
In 1967, after Fred Koch died, of a heart attack, Charles renamed the business Koch Industries, in honor of his father. Fred
Koch's will made his sons extraordinarily wealthy. David Koch joked about his good fortune in a 2003 speech to alumni at
Deerfield, where, after pledging twenty-five million dollars, he was made the school's sole "lifetime trustee." He said, "You
might ask: How does David Koch happen to have the wealth to be so generous? Well, let me tell you a story. It all started when
I was alittle boy. One day, my father gave me an apple. I soon sold it for five dollars and bought two apples and sold them for
ten. Then I bought four apples and sold them for twenty. Well, this went on day after day, week after week, month after month,
year after year, until my father died and left me three hundred million dollars!"
David and Charles had absorbed their father's conservative politics, but they did not share all his views, according to
diZerega, who befriended Charles in the mid-sixties, after meeting him while browsing in a John Birch Society bookstore in
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
Wichita. Charles eventually invited him to the Kochs' mansion, to participate in an informal political-discussion group. "It was
pretty clear that Charles thought some of the Birch Society was bullshit," diZerega recalled.
DiZerega, who has lost touch with Charles, eventually abandOned right-wing views, and became a political-science
professor. He credits Charles with opening his mind to political philosophy, which set him on the path to academia; Charles is
one of three people to whom he dedicated his first book. But diZerega believes that the Koch brothers have followed a wayward
intellectual trajectory, transferring their father's paranoia about Soviet Communism to a distrust of the U.S. government, and
seeing its expansion, beginning with the New Deal, as a tyrannical threat to freedom. In an essay, posted on Beliefnet, diZerega
writes, "As state socialism failed ... the target for many within these organizations shifted to any kind of regulation at all.
'Socialism' kept. being defined downwards."
Members of the. John Birch Society developed.an interest in a school of Austrian economists who promoted free-market
ideals. Charles and David Koch were particularly influenced by the work of Friedrich von Hayek, the author of "The Road to
Serfdom" (1944), which argued that centralized government planning led, inexorably, to totalitarianism. Hayek'S belief in
unfettered capitalism has proved inspirational to many conservatives, and to anti-Soviet dissidents; lately, Tea Party supporters
have championed his work. In June, the talk-radio host Glenn Beck, who has supported the Tea Party rebellion, promoted "The
Road to Serfdom" on his show; the paperback soon became a No. 1 best-seller on Amazon. (Beck appears to be a fan of the
Kochs; in the midst of arecent on-air parody of Al Gore, Beck said, without explanation, "I want to thank Charles Koch for this
information." Beck declined to elaborate on the relationship.)
Charles and David also became devotees of a more radical thinker, Robert LeFevre, who favored the abolition of the state
but didn't like the label "anarchist"; he called himself an "autarchist." LeFevre liked to say that "government is a disease
masquerading as its own cure." In 1956, he opened an institution called the Freedom School, in Colorado Springs. Brian
Doherty, of Reason, told me that "LeFevre was an anarchist figure who won Charles's heart," and that the school was "a tiny
world of people who thought the New Deal was a horrible mistake." According to diZerega, Charles supported the school
financially, and even gave him money to take classes there.
Throughout the seventies, Charles and David continued to build Koch Industries. In 1980, William, with assistance from
Freddie, attempted to take over the company from Charles, who, they felt, had assumed autocratic control. In retaliation, the
company's board, which answered to Charles, fired William. ("Charles runs it all with an iron hand," Bruce Bartlett, the
economist, told me.) Lawsuits were filed, with William and Freddie on one side and Charles and David on the other. In 1983,
Charles and David bought out their brothers' share in the company for nearly a billion dollars. But the antagonism remained,
and litigation continued for seventeen more years, with the brothers hiring rival private investigators; in 1990, they walked past
one another with stony expressions at their mother's funeral. Eventually. Freddie moved to Monaco, which has no income tax.
He bought historic, estates in France. Austria, and elsewhere, filling them with art, antiques, opera scores, and literary
manuscripts. William founded his own energy company, Oxbow, and turned to yachting; he spent an estimated sixty-five
million dollars to win the America's Cup, in 1992.
With Charles as the undisputed chairman and C.E.O., Koch Industries expanded rapidly. Roger Altman, who heads the
investment-banking firm Evercore, told me that the company's performance has been "beyond phenomenal." Charles remained
in Wichita, with his wife and two children, guarding his privacy while supporting community charities. David moved to New
York City, where he is an executive vice-president of the company and the C.E.O. of its Chemical Technology Group. A
financial expert who knows Koch Industries well told me, "Charles is the company. Charles runs it." David, described by
associates as "affable" and "a bit of a lunk," enjoyed for years the life of a wealthy bachelor. He rented a yacht in the South of
France and bought a waterfront home in Southampton, where he threw parties that the Web site New York Social Diary likened
to an "East Coast version of Hugh Hefher's soirees." In 1996, he married Julia Flesher, a fashion assistant. They live in a nine-
thousand-square-foot duplex at 740 Park Avenue, with their three children. Though David's manner is more cosmopolitan, and
more genial, than that of Charles, Brian Doherty, who has interviewed both brothers, couldn't think of a single issue on which
the brothers disagreed.
As their fortunes grew, Charles and David Koch became the primary underwriters of hard-line libertarian politics in
America. Charles's goal, as Doherty described it, was to tear the government "out at the root." The brothers' first major public
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
step came in 1979, when Charles persuaded David, then thirty-nine, to run for public office. They had become supporters of the
Libertarian Party, and were backing its Presidential candidate, Ed Clark, who was running against Ronald Reagan from the
right. Frustrated by the legal limits on campaign donations, they contrived to place David on the ticket, in the Vice-Presidential
slot; upon becoming a candidate, he could lavish as much of his personal fortune as he wished on the campaign. The ticket's
slogan was "The Libertarian Party has only one source of funds: You." In fact, its primary source of funds was David Koch,
who spent more than two million dollars on the effort.
Many of the ideas propounded in the 1980 campaign presaged the Tea Party movement. Ed Clark told The Nation that
libertarians were getting ready to stage "a very big tea party," because people were "sick to death" of taxes. The Libertarian
Party platform called for the abolition of the F.B.I. and the C.I.A., as well as of federal regulatory agencies, such as the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Energy. The Party wanted to end Social Security, minimum-wage
laws, gun control, and all personal and corporate income taxes; it proposed the legalization of prostitution, recreational drugs,
and suicide. Government should be reduced to only one function: the protection of individual rights. William F. Buckley, Jr., a
more traditional conservative, called the movement "Anarcho-Totalitarianism."
That November, the Libertarian ticket received only one per cent of the vote. The brothers realized that their brand of
politics didn't sell at the ballot box. Charles Koch became openly scornful of conventional politics. "It tends to be a nasty,
corrupting business," he told a reporter at the time. "I'm interested in advancing libertarian ideas." According to Doherty's
book, the .Kochs came to regard elected politicians as merely "actors playing out a script." A longtime confidant of the Kochs
told Doherty that the brothers wanted to "supply the themes and words for the scripts." In order to alter the direction of
America, they had to "influence the areas where policy ideas percolate from: academia. and think tanks."
fter the 1980 election, Charles and David Koch receded from the public arena. But they poured more than a hundred million
. dollars into dozens of seemingly independent organizations. Tax records indicate that in 2008 the three main Koch family
foundations gave money.to thirty-four political and policy organizations, three of which they founded, and several of which
they direct. The Kochs and their company have given additional millions to political campaigns, advocacy groups, and
lobbyists. The family's subterranean financial role has fuelled suspicion on the left: Lee Fang, of the liberal blog ThinkProgress,
has called the Kochs the billionaires behind the hate."
Only the Kochs know precisely how much they have spent on politics. Public tax records show that between 1998 and 2008
the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation spent more than forty-eight million dollars. The Claude R. Lambe Charitable
Foundation, which is controlled by Charles Koch and his wife, along with two company employees and an accountant, spent
more than twenty-eight million. The David H. Koch Charitable Foundation spent more than a hundred and twenty million.
Meanwhile, since 1998 Koch Industries has spent more than fifty million dollars on lobbying. Separately, the company's
political-action committee, KochPAC, has donated some eight million dollars to political campaigns, more than eighty
per cent of it to Republicans. So far in 2010, Koch Industries leads all other energy companies in political
contributions, as it has since 2006. In addition, during the past dozen years the Kochs and other family members
have personally spent more than two million dollars on political contributions. In the second quarter of 2010, David
Koch was the biggest individual contributor to the Republican Governors Association, with a million-dollar donation.
Other gifts by the Kochs may be untraceable; federal tax law permits anonymous personal donations to politically
active nonprofit groups.
In recent decades, members of several industrial dynasties have spent parts of their fortunes on a conservative agenda. In
the nineteen-eighties, the Olin family, which owns a chemicals-and-manufacturing conglomerate, became known for funding
right-leaning thinking in academia, particularly in law schools. And during the nineties Richard Mellon Scaife, a descendant of
Andrew Mellon, spent millions attempting to discredit President Bill Clinton. An Rabin-Havt, a vice-president at the
Democratic-leaning Web site Media Matters, said that the Kochs' effort is Unusual, in its marshalling of corporate and personal
funds: "Their role, in terms of financial commitments, is staggering."
Of course, Democrats give money, too. Their most prominent donor, the financier George Soros, runs a foundation, the
Open Society Institute, that has spent as much as a hundred million dollars a year in America. Soros has also made generous
private contributions to various Democratic campaigns, including Obama's. But Michael Vachon, his spokesman, argued that
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
Soros's giving is transparent, and that "none of his contributions are in the service of his own economic interests." The Kochs
have given millions of dollars to nonprofit groups that criticize environmental regulation and support lower taxes for industry.
Gus diZerega, the former friend, suggested that the Kochs' youthful idealism about libertarianism had largely devolved into a
rationale for corporate self-interest. He said of Charles, "Perhaps he has confused making money with freedom."
Some critics have suggested that the Kochs' approach has subverted the purpose of tax-exempt giving. By law, charitable
foundations must conduct exclusively nonpartisan activities that promote the public welfare. A 2004 report by the National
Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, a watchdog group, described the Kochs' foundations as being self-serving,
concluding, "These foundations give money to nonprofit organizations that do research and advocacy on issues that impact the
profit margin of Koch Industries."
The Kochs have gone well beyond their immediate self-interest, however, funding organizations that aim to push the
country in a libertarian. direction. Among the institutions that they have subsidized are the Institute for Justice, which files.
lawsuits opposing state and federal regulations; the Institute for Humane Studies, which underwrites libertarian academics; and
the Bill of Rights Institute, which promotes a conservative slant on the Constitution. Many of the organizations funded by the
Kochs employ specialists who write position Papers that are subsequently quoted by politicians and pundits. David Koch has
acknowledged that the family exerts tight ideological control. "If we're going to give a lot of money, we'll make darn sure they •
spend it in a way that goes along with our intent," he told Doherty. "And if they make a wrong turn and start doing things we
don't agree with, we withdraw funding."
he Kochs' subsidization of a pro-corporate movement fulfills, in many ways, the vision laid out in a secret 1971 memo that
Lewis Powell. then a Virginia attorney, wrote two months before he was nominated to the Supreme Court. The antiwar
movement had turned its anger on defense contractors, such as Dow Chemical, and Ralph Nader was leading a public-interest
crusade against corporations. Powell, writing a report for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, urged American companies to fight
back. The greatest threat to free enterprise, he warned, was not Communism or the New Left but, rather, "respectable elements
of society"—intellectuals, journalists, and scientists. To defeat them, he wrote, business leaders needed to wage a long-term,
• unified campaign to change public opinion.
Charles Koch seems to have approached both business and politics with the deliberation of an engineer. "To bring about
social change," he told Doherty, requires "a strategy" that is "vertically and horizontally integrated," spanning "from idea
creation to policy development to education to grassroots organizations to lobbying to litigation to political action." The project,
he admitted, was extremely ambitious. "We have a radical philosophy," he said.
In 1977, the Kochs provided the funds to launch the nation's first libertarian think tank, the Cato Institute. According to the
'Center for Public Integrity, between 1986 and 1993 the Koch family gave eleven million dollars to the institute. Today Cato
has more than a hundred full-time employees, and its experts and policy papers are widely quoted and respected by the
mainstream media. It describes itself as nonpartisan, and its scholars have at times been critical of both parties. But it has
consistently pushed for corporate tax cuts, reductions in social services, and laissez-faire environmental policies.
When President Obama, in a 2008 speech, described the science on global warming as "beyond dispute," the Cato Institute
took out a full-page ad in the Times to contradict him. Cato's resident scholars have relentlessly criticized political attempts to
stop global warming as expensive, ineffective, and unnecessary. Ed Crane, the Cato Institute's founder and president, told me
that "global-warming theories give the government more control of the economy."
Cato scholars have been particularly energetic in promoting the Climategate scandal. Last year, private e-mails of climate
scientists at the University of East Anglia, in England, were mysteriously leaked, and their exchanges appeared to suggest a
willingness to falsify data in order to buttress the idea that global warming is real. In the two weeks after the e-mails went
public, one Cato scholar gave more than twenty media interviews trumpeting the alleged scandal. But five independent inquiries
have since exonerated the researchers, and nothing was found in their e-mails or data to discredit the scientific consensus on
global warming. •
Nevertheless, the controversy succeeded in spreading skepticism about climate change. Even though the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration recently issued a report concluding that the evidence for global warming is unequivocal, more
Americans are convinced than at any time since 1997 that scientists have exaggerated the seriousness of global warming. The

Kochs promote this statistic on their company's Web site but do not mention the role that their funding has played in fostering
such doubt.
In a 2002 memo, the Republican political consultant Frank Luntz wrote that so long as "voters believe there is no consensus
about global warming within the scientific community' the status quo would prevail. The key for opponents of environmental
reform, he said, was to question the science—a public-relations strategy that the tobacco industry used effectively for years to
forestall regulation. The Kochs have funded many sources of environmental skepticism, such as the Heritage Foundation, which
has argued that "scientific facts gathered in the past 10 years do not support the notion of catastrophic human-made warming."
The brothers have given money to more obscure groups, too, such as the Independent Women's Forum, which opposes the
presentation of global warming as a scientific fact in American public schools. Until 2008, the group was run by Nancy
Pfotenhauer, a former lobbyist for Koch Industries. Mary Beth Jarvis, a vice-president of a Koch subsidiary, is on the group's
board.
Naomi Oreskes, a professor of history and science studies at the University of California, San Diego, is the co-author of
"Merchants of Doubt," a new book that chronicles various attempts by American industry to manipulate public opinion on
science. She noted that the Kochs, as the heads of "a company with refineries and pipelines," have "a lot at stake." She added,
"If the answer is to phase out fossil fuels, a different group of people are going to be making money, so we shouldn't be
surprised that they're fighting tooth and nail."
David Koch told New York that he was unconvinced that global warming has been caused by human activity. Even if it has
been, he said, the heating of the planet will be beneficial, resulting in longer growing seasons in the Northern Hemisphere. "The
Earth will be able to support enormously more people because far greater land area will be available to produce food," he said.
n the mid-eighties, the Kochs provided millions of dollars to George Mason University, in Arlington, Virginia, to set up another
think tank. Now known as the Mercatus Center, it promotes itself as "the world's premier university source for market-oriented
ideas—bridging the gap between academic ideas and real-world problems." Financial records show that the Koch family
foundations have contributed more than thirty million dollar's to George Mason, much of which has gone to the Mercatus
Center, a nonprofit organization. "It's ground zero for deregulation policy in Washington," Rob Stein, the Democratic strategist,
said. It is an unusual arrangement. "George Mason is a public university, and receives public funds," Stein noted. "Virginia is
hosting an institution that the Kochs practically control."
The founder of the Mercatus Center is Richard Fink, formerly an economist. Fink heads Koch Industries' lobbying
operation in Washington. In addition, he is the president of the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation, the president of the
Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation, a director of the Fred C. and Mary R. Koch Foundation, and a director and co-
founder, with David Koch, of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation.
Fink, with his many titles, has become the central nervous system of the Kochtopus. He appears to have supplanted Ed
Crane, the head of the Cato Institute, as the brothers' main political lieutenant. Though David remains on the board at Cato,
Charles Koch has fallen out with Crane. Associates suggested to me that Crane had been insufficiently respectful of Charles's
management philosophy, which he distilled into a book called "The Science of Success," and trademarked under the name
Market-Based Management, or M.B.M. In the book. Charles recommends instilling a company's corporate culture with the
competitiveness of the marketplace.. Koch describes M.B.M. as a "holistic system" containing "five dimensions: vision, virtue
and talents, knowledge processes, decision rights and incentives." A top Cato Institute official told me that Charles "thinks he's
a genius. He's the emperor, and he's convinced he's wearing clothes." Fink, by contrast, has been far more embracing of
Charles's ideas. (Fink, like the Kochs, declined to. be interviewed.)
At a 1995 conference for philanthropfsts, Fink adopted the language of economics when speaking about the Mercatus
Center's purpose. He said that grant-makers should use think tanks and political-action groups to convert intellectual raw
materials into policy "products."
The Wall Street Journal has called the Mercatus Center "the most important think tank you've never heard of," and noted
that fourteen of the twenty-three regulations that President George W. Bush placed on a "hit list" had been suggested first by
Mercatus scholars. Fink told the paper that the Kochs have "other means of fighting [their] battles," and that the Mercatus
Center does riot actively promote the company's private interests. But Thomas McGarity, a law professor at the University of
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
Texas, who specializes in environmental issues, told me that "Koch has been constantly in trouble with the E.P.A., and
Mercatus has constantly hammered on the agency." An environmental lawyer who has clashed with the Mercatus Center called
it "a means of laundering economic aims." The lawyer explained the strategy: "You take corporate money and give it to a
neutral-sounding think tank," which "hires people with pedigrees and academic degrees who put out credible-seeming studies.
But they all coincide perfectly with the economic interests of their funders."
In 1997, for instance, the E.P.A. moved to reduce surface ozone, a form of pollution caused, in part, by emissions from oil
refineries. Susan Dudley, an economist who became a top official at the 'Mercatus Center, criticized the proposed rule. The
E.P.A., she argued, had not taken into account that smog-free skies would result in more cases of skin cancer. She projected that
if pollution were controlled it would cause up to eleven thousand additional cases of skin cancer each year.
In 1999, the District of Columbia Circuit Court took 'up Dudley's smog argument. Evaluating the E.P.A. rule, the court
found that the E.P.A. had "explicitly disregarded" the "possible health benefits of ozone." In another part of the opinion, the
court ruled, 2-1, that the E.P.A. had overstepped its authority in calibrating standards for ozone emissions. As the Constitutional
Accountability Center, a think tank, revealed, the judges in the majority had previously attended legal junkets, on a Montana
ranch, that were arranged by the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment—a group funded by Koch family
foundations. The judges have claimed that the ruling was unaffected by their attendance.
deas don't happen on their own," Matt Kibbe, the president of Freedom Works, a Tea Party advocacy group, told me.
"Throughout history, ideas need patrons." The Koch brothers, after helping to create Cato and Mercatus, concluded that think
tanks alone were not enough to effect change. They needed a mechanism to deliver those ideas to the street, and to attract the
public's support. in 1984, David Koch and Richard Fink created yet another organization. and Kibbe joined them. The group,
Citizens for a Sound Economy, seemed like a grassroots movement, but according to the Center for Public Integrity it was
sponsored principally by the Kochs, who provided $7.9 million between 1986 and 19.93. Its mission, Kibbe said, "was to take
these heavy ideas and translate them for mass America.... We read the same literature Obama did about nonviolent
revolutions--Saul _Minsky, Gandhi, Martin Luther King. We studied the idea of the Boston Tea Party as an example of
nonviolent social change. We learned we needed boots on the ground to sell ideas, not candidates." Within a few years, the
group had mobilized fifty paid field workers, in twenty-six states, to rally voters behind the Kochs' agenda. David and Charles,
according to one participant, were "very controlling, very top down. You can't build an organization with them. They run it."
Around this time, the brothers faced a political crisis. In 1989, the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs investigated
their business and released a scathing report accusing Koch Oil of "a widespread and sophisticated scheme to steal crude oil
from Indians and others through fraudulent mismeasuring." The Kochs admitted that they had improperly taken thirty-one
million dollars' worth of crude oil, but said that it had been accidental. Charles Koch told committee investigators that oil
measurement is "a very uncertain art."
To defend its reputation, Koch IndustrieS hired Robert Strauss, then a premier Washington lobbyist; the company soon
opened an office in the city. A grand jury was convened to investigate the allegations, but it eventually disbanded, without
issuing criminal charges. According to the Senate report, after the committee hearings Koch operatives delved into the personal
lives of committee staffers, even questioning an ex-wife. Senate investigators were upset by the Kochs' tactics. Kenneth Batten,
the counsel to the Senate committee, said, "These people have amassed such unaccountable power!'
.'
By •1993, when Bill Clinton became President, Citizens for a Sound Economy had become a prototype for the kind of
corporate-backed opposition campaigns that have proliferated during the Obama era. The group waged a successful assault on
Clinton's proposed B.T.U. tax on energy, for instance, running advertisements, staging media events, and targeting opponents.
And it mobilized anti-tax rallies outside the Capitol—rallies that NPR described as "designed to strike fear into the hearts of
wavering Democrats." Dan Glickman, a former Democratic congressman from Wichita, who supported the B.I.U. tax, recalled,
"I'd been in Congress eighteen years. The Kochs actually engaged against me and funded my opponent. They used a lot of
'resources and effort—their employees, too." Glickman suffered a surprise defeat. "I can't prove it, but I think I was probably
their victim," he said.
The Kochs continued to disperse their money, creating slippery organizations with generic-sounding names, and this made
it difficult to ascertain the extent of their influence in Washington. In 1990, Citizens for a Sound Economy created a spinoff
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
group, Citizens for the Environment, which called acid rain and other environmental problems "myths." When the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette investigated the matter, it discovered that the spinoff group had "no citizen membership of its own."
In 1997, another Senate investigation began looking into what a minority report called "an audacious plan to pour millions
of dollars in contributions into Republican campaigns nationwide without disclosing the amount or source," in order to evade
campaign-finance laws. A shell corporation, Triad Management, had paid more than three million dollars for attack ads in
twenty-six House races and three Senate races. More than half of the advertising money came from an obscure nonprofit group,
the Economic Education Trust. The Senate committee's minority report suggested that "the trust was financed in whole or in
part by Charles and David Koch of Wichita, Kansas." The brothers were suspected of having secretly paid for the attack ads,
most of which aired in states where Koch Industries did business. In Kansas, where Triad Management was especially active,
the funds may have played a decisive role in four of six federal races. The Kochs, when asked by reporters if they had given the
money, refused to comment. In i998, however, the Wall Street Journal confirmed that a consultant on the Kochs' payroll had
been involved in the scheme. Charles Lewis, of the Center for Public Integrity, described the scandal as "historic. Triad was the
first time a major corporation used a cutout"—a front operation—"in a threatening way. Koch Industries was the poster child of
a company run amok."
uring the Clinton Administration, the energy industry faced increased scrutiny and regulation. In the mid-nineties, the Justice
Department filed two lawsuits against Koch Industries, claiming that it was responsible for more than three hundred oil spills,
which had released an estimated three million gallons of oil into lakes and rivers. The penalty was potentially as high as two
hundred and fourteen million dollars. In a settlement. Koch Industries paid a record thirty-million-dollar civil fine, and agreed to
spend five million dollars on environmental projects.
In 1999, a jury found Koch Industries guilty of negligence and malice in the deaths of two Texas teen-agers in an explosion
that resulted from a leaky underground butane pipeline. (In 2001, the company paid an undisclosed settlement.) And in the final
months of the Clinton Presidency the Justice Department levelled a ninety-seven-count indictment against the company, for
covering up the discharge of ninety-one tons of benzene, a carcinogen, from its refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas. The company
was liable •for three hundred and fifty million dollars in fines, and four Koch employees faced up to thirty-five years in prison.
The Koch Petroleum Group eventually pleaded guilty to one criminal charge of covering up environmental violations, including
the falsification of documents, and paid a twenty-million-dollar fine. David Uhlmann, a career prosecutor who, at the time,
headed the environmental-crimes section at the Justice Department, described the suit as "one of the most significant cases ever
brought under the Clean Air Act." He added, "Environmental crimes are almost always motivated by economics and arrogance,
and in the Koch case there was a healthy dose of both."
During the 2000 election campaign, Koch Industries spent some nine hundred thousand dollars to support the candidacies
of George W. Bush and other Republicans. During the Bush years, Koch Industries and other fossil-fuel companies enjoyed
remarkable prosperity. The 2005 energy bill, which Hillary Clinton dubbed the Dick Cheney Lobbyist Energy Bill, offered
enormous subsidies and tax breaks for energy companies. The Kochs have cast themselves as deficit hawks, but, according to a
study by Media Matters, their companies have benefitted from nearly a hundred million dollars in government contracts since
2000.
In 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy was accused of illegitimately throwing its weight behind Bush's reelection. The
group's Oregon branch had attempted to get Ralph Nader on the Presidential ballot, in order to dilute Democratic support for
John Kerry. Critics argued that it was illegal, for a tax-exempt nonprofit organization to donate its services for partisan political
purposes. (A complaint was filed with the Federal Election Commission; it was dismissed.)
That year, internal rivalries at Citizens for a Sound Economy caused the organization to split apart. David Koch and Fink
started a new group, Americans for Prosperity, and they hired Tim Phillips to run it. Phillips was a political veteran who had
worked with Ralph Reed, the evangelical leader and Republican activist, co-founding Century Strategies, a campaign-
consulting company that became notorious for its ties to the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Phillips's online biography
describes him as an expert in "grasstops" and "grassroots" political organizing. The Kochs' choice of Phillips signalled an even
greater toughness. The conservative operative Grover Norquist, who is known for praising "throat slitters" in politics, called
Phillips "a grownup who can make things happen."

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
Last year, Phillips told the Financial Times that Americans for Prosperity had only eight thousand registered members.
Currently, its Web site claims that the group has "1.2 million activists." Whatever its size, the Kochs' political involvement has
been intense; a former employee of the Cato Institute told me that Americans for Prosperity "was micromanaged by the Kochs."
And the brothers' investment may well have paid off: Americans for Prosperity, in concert with the family's other
organizations, has been instrumental in disrupting the Obama Presidency.
In January, 2008, Charles Koch wrote in his company newsletter that America could be on the verge of "the greatest loss of
liberty and prosperity since the 1930s." That October, Americans for Prosperity held a conference of conservative operatives at
a Marriott hotel outside Washington. Erick Erickson, the editor-in-chief of the conservative blog RedState.com, took the lectern,
thanked David Koch, and vowed to "unite and fiaht ... the armies of the left!" Sodn after Obama assumed office, Americans
for Prosperity launched "Porkulus" rallies against Obama's stimulus-spending measures. Then the Mercatus Center released a
report claiming that stimulus funds had been directed disproportionately toward Democratic districts; eventually, the author was
forced to correct the report, but not before Rush Limbaugh, citing.the paper, had labelled Obama's program "a slush fund," and
Fox News and other conservative outlets had echoed the sentiment. (Phil Kerpen, the vice-president for policy at Americans for
Prosperity, is a contributor to the Fox News Web site. Another officer at Americans for Prosperity, Walter Williams, often
guest-hosts for Limbaugh.)
Americans for Prosperity also created an offshoot, Patients United Now, which organized what Phillips has estimated to be
more than three hundred rallies against health-care reform. Atone rally, an effigy of a Democratic congressman was hung; at
another, protesters unfurled a banner depicting corpses from Dachau. The group also helped organize the "Kill the Bill" protests
outside the Capitol, in March, where Democratic supporters of health-care reform alleged that they were spat on and cursed at.
Phillips was a featured speaker.
Americans for Prosperity has held at least eighty events targeting cap-and-trade legislation, which is aimed at making
industries pay for the air pollution that they create. Speakers for the group claimed, with exaggeration, that even back-yard
barbecues and kitchen stoves would be taxed. The group was also involved in the attacks on Obama's "green jobs" czar, Van
Jones, and waged a crusade against international climate talks. Casting, his group as a champion of ordinary workers who would
be hurt by environmentalists, Phillips went to Copenhagen last year and staged a protest outside the United Nations conference
on climate change, declaring, "We're a grassroots organization.... 1 think it's unfortunate when wealthy children of wealthy
families . want to send unemployment rates in the United States up to twenty per cent."
Grover Norquist, who holds a weekly meeting for conservative leaders in Washington, including representatives from
Americans for Prosperity, told me that last summer's raucous rallies were pivotal in undermining Obama's agenda. The
Republican leadership in Congress, he said, "couldn't have clone it without August, when people went out on the streets. It
discouraged deal-makers"—Republicans who might otherwise have worked constructively with Obama. Moreover, the
appearance of growing public opposition to Obama affected corporate donors on K Street. "K Street is a three-billion-dollar
weathervane," Norquist said. "When Obama was strong, the Chamber of Commerce said, 'We can work with the Obama
Administration.' But that changed when thousands of people went into the street and 'terrorized' congressmen. August is what
changed it. Now that Obama is weak, people are getting tough."
As the first anniversary of Obama's election approached, David Koch came to the Washington area to attend a triumphant
Americans for Prosperity gathering. Obama's poll numbers were falling fast. Not .a single Republican senator was working with
the Administration on health care, or much else. Pundits were writing about Obama's political ineptitude, and Tea Party groups
were accusing the President of initiating "a government takeover." In a speech, Koch said, "Days like today bring to reality the
vision of our board of directors when we started this organization, five years ago." He went on, "We envisioned a mass
movement, a state-based one, but national in scope, of hundreds of thousands of American citizens from all walks of life
standing up and fighting for the economic freedoms that made our nation the most prosperous society in history.... Thankfully,
the stirrings from California to Virginia, and from Texas to Michigan, show that more and more of our fellow-citizens are
beginning to see the same truths as we do." .
While Koch didn't explicitly embrace the Tea Party movement that day, more recently he has come close to doing so,
praising it for demonstrating the "powerful visceral hostility in the body politic against the massive increase in government
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
power, the massive efforts to socialize this country." Charles Koch, in a newsletter sent to his seventy thousand employees,
compared the Obama Administration to the regime of the Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez. The Kochs' sense of
imperilment is somewhat puzzling. Income inequality in America is greater than it has been since the nineteen-twenties, and
since the seventies the tax rates of the wealthiest have fallen more than those of the middle class. Yet the brothers' message has
evidently resonated with voters: a recent poll found that fifty-five per cent of Americans agreed that Obama is a socialist.
Americans for Prosperity, meanwhile, has announced that it will spend an additional forty-five million dollars before the
midterm elections, in November. Although the group is legally prohibited from directly endorsing candidates, it nonetheless
plans to target some fifty House races and half a dozen Senate races, staging rallies, organizing door-to-door canvassing, and
running ads aimed at "educating voters about where candidates stand."
Though the Kochs have slowed Obama's momentum, their larger political battle is far from won. Richard Fink, interviewed
by FrumForum.com this spring, said, "If you look at where we've gone from the year 2000 to now, with the expansion of
government spending and a debt burden that threatens to bankrupt the country, it doesn't look very good at all." He went on, "It
looks like the infrastructure that was built and ruirtitred has not carried the day." He suggested that the Kochs needed "to get
more into the practical, day-to-day issues of governing."
n 1991, David Koch was badly injured in a plane crash.in Los Angeles. He was the sole passenger in first class to survive. As he
was recovering, a routine physical exam led to the discovery of prostate cancer. Koch received treatment, settled down, started a
family, and reconsidered his life. As he told Portfolio, "When you're the only one who survived in the front of the plane and
everyone.else died—yeah, you think, 'My God, the good Lord spared me for some greater purpose.' My joke is that I've been
busy ever since, doing all the good work 1 can think of, so He can have confidence in me."
Koch began giving spectacularly large donations to the arts and sciences. And he became a patron of cancer research,
focussing on prostate cancer. In addition to his gifts to Sloan-Kettering, he gave fifteen million dollars to New York-
Presbyterian Hospital, a hundred and twenty-five million to M.I.T. for cancer research, twenty million to Johns Hopkins
University, and twenty-five million to the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston. In response to his generosity, Sloan-
Kettering gave Koch its Excellence in Corporate Leadership Award. In 2004, President Bush named him to the National Cancer
Advisory Board, which guides the National.Cancer Institute.
Koch's corporate and political roles, however, may pose conflicts of interest. For example, at the same time that David
Koch has been casting himself as a champion in the fight against cancer, Koch Industries has been lobbying to prevent the
E.P.A. from classifying formaldehyde, which the company produces in great quantities, as a "known carcinogen" in humans.
Scientists have long known that formaldehyde causes cancer in rats, and several major scientific studies have concluded
that formaldehyde causes cancer in human beings—including one published last year by the National Cancer Institute, on
•whose advisory board Koch sits. The study tracked twenty-five thousand patients for an average of forty years; subjects exposed
to higher amounts of formaldehyde had significantly higher rates of leukemia. These results helped lead an expert panel within
the National Institutes of Health to conclude that formaldehyde should be categorized as a known carcinogen, and be strictly
controlled by the government. Corporations have resisted regulations on formaldehyde for decades, however, and Koch
Industries has been a large funder of members of Congress who have stymied the E.P.A., requiring it to defer new regulations
until more studies are completed.
Koch Industries became a major producer of the chemical in 2005, after it bought Georgia-Pacific, the paper and wood-
products company, for twenty-one billion dollars. Georgia-Pacific manufactures formaldehyde in its chemical division, and uses
it to produce various wood products, such as plywood and laminates. Its annual production capacity for formaldehyde is 2.2
billion pounds. Last December, Traylor Champion, Georgia-Pacific's vice-president of environmental affairs, sent a formal
letter of protest to federal health authorities. He wrote that the company "strongly disagrees" with the N.I.H. panel's conclusion
that formaldehyde should be treated as a known human carcinogen. David Koch did not recuse himself from the National
Cancer Advisory Board, or divest himself of company stock, while his company was directly lobbying the government to keep
formaldehyde on the market. (A board spokesperson said that the issue of formaldehyde had not come up.)
James Fluff, an associate director at the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences, a division of the N.I.H., told
me that it was "disgusting" for Koch to be serving on the National Cancer Advisory Board: "It's just not good for public health.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015

Vested interests should not be on the board." He 'went on, "Those boards are very important. They're very influential as to
whether N.C.I. goes into formaldehyde or not. Billions of dollars are involved in formaldehyde."
Harold Vannus, the director of the National Cancer Institute, knows David Koch from Memorial Sloan-Kettering, which he
used to run. He said that, at Sloan-Kettering, "a lot of people who gave to us had large business interests. The one thing we
wouldn't tolerate in our board members is tobacco." When told of Koch Industries' stance on formaldehyde, Varmus said that
he was "surprised."
he David H. Koch Hall of Human Origins, at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, is a multimedia
exploration of the theory that mankind evolved in response to climate change. At the main entrance, viewers are confronted
with a giant graph charting the Earth's temperature over the past ten million years, which notes that it is far cooler now than it
was ten thousand years ago. Overhead, the text reads, "HUMANS EVOLVED IN RESPONSE TO A CHANGING WORLD." The
message, as amplified by the exhibit's Web site, is that "key human adaptations evolved in response to
environmental instability." Only at the end of the exhibit, under the headline "OUR SURVIVAL CHALLENGE," is it noted
that levels of carbon dioxide are higher now than they have ever been, and that they are projected to increase
dramatically in the next century. No cause is given for this development; no mention is made of any possible role
played by fossil fuels. The exhibit makes it seem part of a natural continuum. The accompanying text says, "During
the period in which humans evolved, Earth's temperature and the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
fluctuated together." An interactive game in the exhibit suggests that humans will continue to adapt to climate
change in the future. People may build "underground cities;" developing "short, compact bodies" or "curved spines,"
so that "moving around in tight spaces will be no problem."
Such ideas uncannily echo the Koch message. The company's January newsletter to employees, for instance, argueS that
"fluctuations in the earth's climate predate humanity," and concludes, "Since we can't control Mother Nature, let's figure out
how to get along with her changes." Joseph Romm, a physicist who runs the Web site ClirnateProgress.org, is infuriated by the
Smithsonian's presentation. "The whole exhibit whitewashes the modern climate issue," he said. "I think the Kochs wanted to
be seen as some sort of high-minded company, associated with the greatest natural-history and science museum in the country.
But the truth is, the exhibit is underwritten by big-time polluters, who are underground .funders of action to stop efforts to deal
with this threat to humanity. I think the Smithsonian should have drawn the line."
Cristian Samper, the museum's director, said that the exhibit is not about climate change, and described Koch as "one of the
best donors we've had, in my tenure here, because he's very interested in the content, but completely hands off." He noted, "1.
don't know all the details.of his involvement in other issues."
The Kochs have long depended on the public's not knowing all the details about them. They have been content to operate what
David Koch has called "the largest company that you've never heard of." But with the growing prominence of the Tea Party,
and with increased awareness of the Kochs' ties to the movement, the brothers may find it harder to deflect scrutiny. Recently,
President °barna took aim at the Kochs' political network. Speaking at a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser, in
Austin, he warned supporters that the Supreme Court's recent ruling in the Citizens United case—which struck down laws
prohibiting direct Corporate spending on campaigns—had made it even easier for big companies to hide behind "groups with
harmless-sounding names like Americans for Prosperity." Obama said, "They don't have to say who, exactly, Americans for
Prosperity are. You don't know if it's a foreign-controlled corporation"—or even, he added, "a big oil company."

Re: GOP unpopularity, Boehner unpopularity, stealth agenda for campaign and beyond
The Republican Party, despite everything, remains deeply unpopular. (See the second Ohio poll below.)
The Republicans have made the election a referendum on Obama and the Democrats, succeeding beyond
their wildest dreams. (See the first poll below on Obama-Bush matchup and question 12 in second poll
on Ohio voters' recall on who they voted for in 2008, giving McCain a three point margin.)
The Republicans have managed to hide their own negatives through the negative campaign against Obama.
The campaign is not being conducted as a contest. The Republicans have succeeded in making it only about
approval of Obama.
The GOP is hiding John Boehner, who is unpopular in his home state of Ohio, where he's best known. To
the extent he is known, he is disliked.
The Republicans are pretending they offer something new and not really the same old Republicans, to the
extent they make any sort of offer.
The Tea Party is deliberately trying to hide its extremism behind a mask of novelty and now religious
rhetoric. (The right wing strategy has been spelled out in detail to a friend of mine,
So tar, there is no Democratic campaign to focus on the Republicans and, therefore, no contest. Republicans
are not being exposed for their increasing dependence on extremists. They are not being pressed for their
refusal to denounce extremism. Nor is the Tea Party being revealed as an extremist takeover movement.
Nor is the Republicans' motive for smearing Obama being identified as a cynical strategy to put
Boehner in power.
Whatever issue ginned up by Republicans—from illegal immigration to the "ground zero mosque"—is not
about the issue itself. Everything, but everything, is about making John Boehner, that old scandal ridden

hack Republican, the Speaker. No matter what the Republicans say, the ultimate issue is the Boehner
power-grab.
The Republican Party is the same old party. It's unreformed. It hasn't learned anything. It can't control its
extremists.

Previewing Ohio
We'll start rolling out our Ohio poll results tomorrow but there's one finding on the poll that pretty much sums it
up: by a 50-42 margin voters there say they'd rather have George W. Bush in the White House right now than
Barack Obama.
Independents hold that view by a 44-37 margin and there are more Democrats who would take Bush back
(11%) than there are Republicans who think Obama's preferable (3%.)
A couple months ago I thought the Pennsylvanias and Missouris and Ohios of the world were the biggest
battlegrounds for 2010 but when you see numbers like this it makes you think it's probably actually the
Californias and the Wisconsins and the Washingtons.
There's not much doubt things are getting worse for Democrats.. .and they were already pretty bad. Somehow
the party base needs to get reinvigorated over the next two months or there's going to be a very, very steep price
to pay.

QUESTIONS ABOUT THE POLL: TOM JENSEN 919-744-6312
GOP Leads OH Generic Ballot, Boehner Not Popular
Raleigh, N.C. — Despite expanding their lead to 47-41 over Democrats in the generic
Congressional ballot, only 29% of likely Ohio voters approve of the direction of the
Republican Party, with 55% disapproving, suggesting that their preference for the GOP is
simply a vote for change, not a vote of affirmation or a mandate. Also supporting that
notion: a 43% plurality finds the GOP to be too conservative, with only 29% seeing their
views as "about right."
And in bad news for Minority Leader John Boehner, only 28% of his home-state voters
want him to become Speaker if Republicans take back the U.S. House, with 44%
preferring "someone else." GOP voters do support Boehner for Speaker, but only by a
54-15 margin. Democrats, who would not vote for a Republican majority anyway,

oppose him, 73-6, and independents, 41-22.
In June, Republicans were favored for Congress only 44-43 among registered voters, but
the six-point shift in the partisan makeup of the likely electorate corresponds almost
exactly with the shift in the generic ballot. On top of that, Republicans are united around
their party's candidates 94-1, versus Democrats at 89-6. Democrats have actually
improved slightly among independents, though Republicans still lead 36-23. There is
considerable room for Democratic House candidates to make up ground by appealing to
the 41% of unaffiliateds who are undecided and by boosting turnout among their voters.
While Republicans approve of the direction of their party, 59-20, independents
disapprove, 61-13. 31% of Republicans and 20% of independents find the GOP too
liberal, but 76% of Democrats and 43% of independents find it too conservative.
There has been no change in the race for Attorney General. Mike DeWine leads
Democrat Richard Cordray 44-40 after leading 44-41 in June.
PPP surveyed 475 likely Ohio voters from August 27th to 29th. The margin of error for
the survey is +/-4.5%. Other factors, such as refusal to be interviewed and weighting,
may introduce additional error that is more difficult to quantify.

Off the record: I had long conversation yesterday with very scary. His
prediction: "a wave of Biblical proportions" in Novem3er. the House is gone; he sees a new bloc of up to 10
true conservative senators, joining Coburn and DeMint, and creating a virtual third party in Senate holding
balance of power. He says their polling suggests Tea Party candidates well ahead in Ky. Colo. senate races
(NYT disputes that today) , and Nevada still a tossup. .1 went to the Glenn Back rally, an
largely agreed with my assessment that its purpose in part was to inoculate the movement against public
concern over extremism and racism leading up to election. (Thus theme of Faith, Hope, Charity.) Americans for
Prosperity (Koch group) made sure there were no signs, etc.
No love lost for post-1996 Republican hacks, among whom he numbered Gingrich, DeLay, Hastert -- and Rove
who is on the outs with his people.
Oversight committees will take lead in House after GOP victory, with a particular focus on Holder and Justice
Dept. and KSM decision. Purpose will be to keep Democrats on defensive for whole 2 years leading up to 2012
election. (Obama, you recall, nixed investigations of Bush administration because he wanted to unite the
country.) Would there be an investigation of Obama citizenship?? couldnt say b ecause he is now totally
focused on the election, not what comes after.
My take: Of course House will vote to repeal health care reform (despite no chance of senate
passage) ; funding dozens of EPA initiatives in Appropriations Committee, and there will be stand-alone vote to
block EPA from implementing carbon rules (even though EPA is only acting as a result of a Supreme Court
decision); and budget legislation that adopts part of the Ryan plan (tho not privatization of SS.)..

administration because he wanted to unite the country.) Would there be an investigation of
Obama citizenship?? couldnt say b ecause he is now totally focused on the election, not what
comes after.
My take: Of course House will vote to repeal health care reform (despite no
chance of senate passage) ; funding dozens of EPA initiatives in Appropriations Committee, and
there will be stand-alone vote to block EPA from implementing carbon rules (even though EPA
is only acting as a result of a Supreme Court decision); and budget legislation that adopts part of
the Ryan plan (tho not privatization of SS.)..

For: Hillary
From: Sid
Re: GOP unpopularity, Boehner unpopularity, stealth agenda for campaign and beyond
1. The Republican Party, despite everything, remains deeply unpopular. (See the second
Ohio poll below.)
2. The Republicans have made the election a referendum on Obama and the Democrats,
succeeding beyond their wildest dreams. (See the first poll below on Obama-Bush
matchup and question 12 in second poll on Ohio voters' recall on who they voted for in
2008, giving McCain a three point margin.)
3. The Republicans have managed to hide their own negatives through the negative
campaign against Obama.
4. The campaign is not being conducted as a contest. The Republicans have succeeded in
making it only about approval of Obama.
5. The GOP is hiding John Boehner, who is unpopular in his home state of Ohio, where he's
best known. To the extent he is known, he is disliked.
6. The Republicans are pretending they offer something new and not really the same old
Republicans, to the extent they make any sort of offer.
7. The Tea Party is deliberately trying to hide its extremism behind a mask of novelty and
now religious rhetoric. (The right wing strategy has been spelled out in detail to a friend
of mine,
B6
8. So far, there is no Democratic campaign to focus on the Republicans and, therefore, no
contest. Republicans are not being exposed for their increasing dependence on extremists.
They are not being pressed for their refusal to denounce extremism. Nor is the Tea Party
being revealed as an extremist takeover movement. Nor is the Republicans' motive for
smearing Obama being identified as a cynical strategy to put Boehner in power.
9. Whatever issue ginned up by Republicans--from illegal immigration to the "ground zero
mosque"—is not about the issue itself. Everything, but everything, is about making John
Boehner, that old scandal ridden hack Republican, the Speaker. No matter what the
Republicans say, the ultimate issue is the Boehner power-grab.

10. The Republican Party is the same old party. It's unreformed. It hasn't learned anything. It
can't control its extremists.

'
We'll start rolling out our Ohio poll results tomorrow but there's one finding on the poll that
pretty much sums it up: by a 50-42 margin voters there say they'd rather have George W. Bush in
the White House right now than Barack Obama.
Independents hold that view by a 44-37 margin and there are more Democrats who would take
Bush back (11%) than there are Republicans who think Obama's preferable (3%.)
A couple months ago I thought the Pennsylvanias and Missouris and Ohios of the world were the
biggest battlegrounds for 2010 but when you see numbers like this it makes you think it's
probably actually the Californias and the Wisconsins and the Washingtons.
There's not much doubt things are getting worse :for Democrats.. .and they were already pretty
bad. Somehow the party base needs to act reinvigorated over the next two months or there's
going to be a very, very steep price to pay.

GOP Leads OH Generic Ballot, Boehner Not Popular
Raleigh, N.C. — Despite expanding their lead to 47-41 over Democrats in the generic
Congressional ballot,.only 29% of likely Ohio voters approve of the direction of the
Republican Party, with 55% disapproving, suggesting that their preference for the GOP is
simply a vote for change, not a vote of affirmation or a mandate. Also supporting that .
notion: a 43% plurality finds the GOP to be too conservative, with only 29% seeing their
views as "about right."
And in bad news for Minority Leader John Boehner, only 28% of his home-state voters

want him to become Speaker if Republicans take back the U.S. House, with 44%
preferring "someone else." GOP voters do support Boehner for Speaker, but only by a
54-15 margin. Democrats, who would not vote for a Republican majority anyway,
oppose him, 73-6, and independents, 41-22.
In June, Republicans were favored for Congress only 44-43 among registered voters, but
the six-point shift in the partisan makeup of the likely electorate corresponds almost
exactly with the shift in the generic ballot. On top of that, Republicans are united around
their party's candidates 94-1, versus Democrats at 89-6. Democrats have actually
improved slightly among independents, though Republicans still lead 36-23. There is
considerable room for Democratic House candidates to make up ground by appealing to
the 41% of unaffiliateds who are undecided and by boosting turnout among their voters.
While Republicans approve of the direction of their party, 59-20, independents
disapprove, 61-13. 31% of Republicans and 20% of independents find the GOP too
liberal, but 76% of Democrats and 43% of independents find it too conservative.
There has been no change in the race for Attorney General. Mike DeWine leads
Democrat Richard Cordray 44-40 after leading 44-41 in June.
PPP surveyed 475 likely Ohio voters from August 27th to 29th. The margin of error for
the survey is +/-4.5%. Other factors, such as refusal to be interviewed and weighting,
may introduce additional error that is more difficult to quantify.

His prediction: "a wave of Biblical proportions" in November. the House is gone; he sees a new
bloc of up to 10 true conservative senators, joining Coburn and DeMint, and creating a virtual
third party in Senate holding balance of power. He says their polling suggests Tea Party
candidates well ahead in Ky., Colo., senate races YT disputes that today) , and Nevada still a
tossup. .1 went to the Glenn Back rally, and largely agreed with my assessment that its
purpose in part was to inoculate the movement against public concern over extremism and

1. The Wikileaks disclosure is the opposite of the Pentagon Papers. The Pentagon Papers provided evidence from an

of our diplomats. Our diplomats are doing their work on the frontlines of national security.

Murdoch: Mayor Bloomberg Called President Obama the Most "Arrogant" Man He Ever
Met

You may recall that during President Obama's vacation at Martha's Vineyard, on August 27 he took in a round of golf at the Vineyard
Golf Club in Edgartown, playing golf with New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg; Democratic lawyer, business man and eminence
grise Vernon Jordan; and White House trip director (and former golf pro) Marvin Nicholson.
The pool report at the time said that "We are told Bloomberg and Obama talked in the clubhouse for about 15 mins about the economy.
They then went to the driving range."
Apparently — at least from a second-hand report — the Obama-Bloomberg convo could have gone better.
In an interview with The Australian Financial Review, conservative media magnate Rupert Murdoch says "Bloomberg said it was a
pleasant day. In conversation he put a few ideas ... He said it was like verbal ping pong."
Bloomberg, according to Murdoch, "came back and said 'I never met in my life such an arrogant mare."
A spokesman for Bloomberg did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Murdoch — the Australian-born founder, chairman, and chief executive officer of News Corporation, which owns conservative media
outlets ranging from Fox News Channel to the New York Post — is described by The Age as saying in the interview that President
Obama "might make great speeches but doesn't get things done and doesn't listen to anybody."
Earlier this year, News Corporation gave $1 million to the Republican Governors Association as well as $1 million to the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce, which largely worked to elect Republicans in the 2010 midterm elections.
The interview was first picked up in the U.S. by The Politico's Ben Smith.
--Jake Tapper
UPDATE: It's worth pointing out that Bloomberg and Murdoch have been friends and allies for years.
In an August 2001 story about Bloomberg's mayoral ambitions in the Melbourne Australia Herald Sun, New York Post columnist Steve
Dunleavy says that Bloomberg is "probably better known in Bondi" -- a suburb of Sydney, Australia -- "than in Brooklyn" because
Bloomberg News runs on Australian pay TV.
"He's probably right," Bloomberg said in the profile. "That's thanks to Rupert (Murdoch). He put it on Foxtel well before it took off in
other parts of the world."
Bloomberg also chatted with his longtime friend before he made public his plans to change New York City's term-limits laws and run for
a third term; he'd need the New York Post, which Murdoch owns, on board.
Joyce Purnick, author of "Mike Bloomberg: Money, Power, Politics," was given unprecedented access to the mayor, and describes
Bloomberg in Sun Valley, Idaho, making plans with Murdoch, and the two dining at Primavera in Manhattan. Bloomberg was pVanning to
announce his intention to seek a third term but had not made up his mind yet. Murdoch was clearly on board.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772105 Date: 08/31/2015
Writes Purnick:
"Murdoch, who considered the Democrats lining up to succeed the mayor 'too horrible, too dangerous' to contemplate, wanted to run an
editorial in the Post immediately. Wait just a little while, Bloomberg advises. 'He said, "Don't come out for me yet, I don't want to leave
you out on a limb," Murdoch recalled. The mayor had to take care of more business first.. .An obviously orchestrated rollout began on
September 29.. .The next day, a Post editorial trumpeted RUN, MIKE, RUN...
In September of this year the two joined forces to testify in favor of immigration reform.

H: First review of your speech. Goad you used Acheson. Sid
aary's Homerun of a Speech
by Tunku Varadarajan
September 8, 2010 I 12:16pm
Clinton speaks at the Council on Foreign Relations September 8, 2010 in Washington,
,
DC. (Mark Wilson / Getty Images) The secretary of State delivered the best speech of the Obama
administration this morning. Tunku Varadarajan on her "new American moment"—and why she's
better than her boss.
Behold the Hillary Doctrine. And heap abundant gratitude—and rose petals if you have them on hand—on the firm,
unfussy, deeply reassuring woman who has just offered it up to the world.
In the 20 months since this administration began administering (a verb I use only in the loosest sense), the speech
Wednesday morning by Hillary Clinton, delivered at the Council on Foreign Relations, was the first time we have been
given an unreserved lift of the heart by any of its members. It was, by far, the best speech of this administration. Whereas
her president has frequently wrung his elegant hands, doing the rounds of the world to reassure foreign leaders that
America is a cuddly bunny at heart, the secretary of State declared Wednesday that we are all living "a new American
moment—a moment when our global leadership is essential." There was no bowing from her to potentates in robes; there
was, instead, a promise that "we will do everything we can to exercise the traditions of American leadership at home and
abroad."
What is so piquant here is not the fact that Hillary understands that Obama is president. It is the growing sense that Hillary
would have made a much, much better president than Obama.
Try this for size: "The United States can, must and will lead in the new century." In order to do that, Clinton promised "a
new global architecture," "built to last and withstand stress." And in a muscular departure from the way in which this
administration—for fear of seeming Bush-like—has been shrinking from the unembarrassed propagation of American
values, she uttered these plainspoken, unadorned words: "Democracy needs defending."
X
Human rights, too, came in for a robust airing: China was scolded, and exhorted to follow "the rules of the road" in its
aspiration to be a great power; as was Russia, for its invasion of Georgia. The message: We may live in a multipolar
world, but we have higher standards by far than those who would style themselves as our equals.
Clinton used phrases like "American might," words that we are more accustomed to hearing from Republicans—words
that we've come to believe that many Democrats can't bear to voice. How refreshing, therefore, that she should reach into
a vocabulary of pride that most American citizens would applaud.
Hillary Clinton invoked the name of Dean Acheson in her reference to the need for "good, old-fashioned diplomacy," and
there certainly was an air of the Achesonian, of the statesman, about her speech. Good, old-fashioned diplomacy, it
should be noted, is in contrast to Obama's apparent preference for seeing America as a nation like any other, only a bit
bigger, richer, and better-armed. Clinton's "old-fashioned" diplomacy is based, by contrast, on the unquestionable premise
that America is the world's leader. Not primus inter pares; just primus.
In her speech, Clinton referred to the sources of "American might." The first, of course, is "economic power." But it is her
hailing of the second—America's "moral authority"—that was so invigorating.
It was Acheson who said: "The most important aspect of the relationship between the president and the secretary of state
is that they both understand who is president." What is so piquant here, in this administration, is not the fact, plain to
behold, that Hillary understands that Obama is president. It is the growing sense that Hillary would have made a much,
much better president than Obama.

of state are still going nowhere. I have no idea whether
the reason is sheer bureaucracy (lots of requests)
or personal (someone didn't like something I wrote?).
I would think that the subject matter -- foreign policy
after the Vulcans -- is a natural one for her.
While it's not absolutely necessary,
it would certainly add insight. I don't know
if you can do anything to help, but if so,
I'd certainly appreciate it.
Best,

Hillary Clinton speaks at the Council on Foreign Relations September 8, 2010 in
Washington, DC. (Mark Wilson / Getty Images) The secretary of State delivered
the best speech of the Obama administration this morning. Tunku Varadarajan on
her "pew American moment"—and why she's better than her boss.
Behold the Hillary Doctrine. And heap abundant gratitude—and rose petals if you
have them on hand—on the firm, unfussy, deeply reassuring woman who has just
offered it up to the world.
In the 20 months since this administration began administering (a verb I use
only in the loosest sense), the speech
<http://www.cspan.org/Watch/Media/2010/09/08/HP/R/37857/Sec+Clinton+discusses+Advancing+A
merican+Interests+on+a+Global+Scale.aspx>
Wednesday morning by Hillary Clinton, delivered at the Council on Foreign
Relations <http://www.cfr.org/> , was the first time we have been given an
unreserved lift of the heart by any of its members. It was, by far, the best
speech of this administration. Whereas her president has frequently wrung his
elegant hands, doing the rounds of the world to reassure foreign leaders that
America is a cuddly bunny at heart, the secretary of State declared Wednesday
that we are all living "a new American moment—a moment when our global
leadership is essential." There was no bowing from her to potentates in robes;
there was, instead, a promise that "we will do everything we can to exercise the
traditions of American leadership at home and abroad."

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772134 Date: 08/31/2015
What is so piquant here is not the fact that Hillary understands that Obama is
president. It is the growing sense that Hillary would have made a much, much
better president than Obama.
Try this for size: "The United States can, must and will lead in the new
century." In order to do that, Clinton promised "a new global architecture,"
"built to last and withstand stress." And in a muscular departure from the way
in which this administration—for fear of seeming Bush-like—has been shrinking
from the unembarrassed propagation of American values, she uttered these
plainspoken, unadorned words: "Democracy needs defending."
Human rights, too, came in for a robust airing: China was scolded, and exhorted
to follow "the rules of the road" in its aspiration to be a great power; as was
Russia, for its invasion of Georgia. The message: We may live in a multipolar
world, but we have higher standards by far than those who would style themselves
as our equals.
Clinton used phrases like "American might," words that we are more accustomed to
hearing from Republicans—words that we've come to believe that many Democrats
can't bear to voice. How refreshing, therefore, that she should reach into a
vocabulary of pride that most American citizens would applaud.
Hillary Clinton invoked the name of Dean Acheson
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean Acheson>
in her reference to the need for "good, old-fashioned diplomacy," and there

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772134 Date: 08/31/2015
certainly was an air of the Achesonian, of the statesman, about her speech.
Good, old-fashioned diplomacy, it should be noted, is in contrast to Obama's
apparent preference for seeing America as a nation like any other, only a bit
bigger, richer, and better-armed. Clinton's "old-fashioned" diplomacy is based,
by contrast, on the unquestionable premise that America is the world's leader.
Not primus inter pares; just primus.
In her speech, Clinton referred to the sources of "American might." The first,
of course, is "economic power." But it is her hailing of the second—America's
"moral authority"—that was so invigorating.
It was Acheson who said: "The most important aspect of the relationship between
the president and the secretary of state is that they both understand who is
president." What is so piquant here, in this administration, is not the fact,
plain to behold, that Hillary understands that Obama is president. It is the
growing sense that Hillary would have made a much, much better president than
Obama.

Re: Some paragraphs on the Tea Party
First, of course your instinct is right to attempt to save the situation. I think, however, it is
fraught. Being, right easily might be worse than being wrong. (Doing absolutely nothing,
meanwhile, would bear no cost, just to note the benefits of irresponsibility.) So, how any advice
can be proposed without potential pitfalls is a mystery to me. It may be that Bill delivers the
message in public, on the stump. This message, on extremism and the GOP, ought to be given
soon, on Labor Day or immediately thereafter. Urgently, the momentum of the far right needs to
be blunted; it must be redefined; the political discussion must be shaped and shifted; and the
GOP must be put on the defensive and begin to pay the price.
I will send you another memo soon, with other messages, themes and strategies.
Here, for better or worse, is some language on extremism and the Republican Party:
The Republican Party today is a captive party. It is captive to the swamp fevers of the extreme
right. It is captive to its out-of-power desperation for political power—willing to do and say
anything to grab it—willing to use extremists to help climb back to power—willing to give the
extremists power. No one is speaking up for responsible conservatism within the Republican
Party. Who will play the role of William F. Buckley, Jr.? Or Richard Nixon? Or Ronald Reagan?
Or Barry Goldwater? They all drew lines to separate the party from the extremists. Now who has
the courage to condemn the outrageous bigotry and slander against the President? Have they at
long last no sense of decency?
If the Republicans don't have the nerve to speak up for their own best heritage, then someone has
to do it. The Republican Party is in a state of political disorder. Into the midst of its chaos a
Trojan Horse has been thrust in the form of a self-proclaimed Tea Party as though the extremists
behind it have something to do with the American Revolution and are not a stealth takeover
operation of a confused political party funded by the same people who paid for the extremist
movements against President Eisenhower and President Kennedy.

There is a straight line between extremists then and extremists now. One of those lines is a
money line. Follow the money. Another continuity is the far right John Birch Society that is
praised today by Glenn Beck. Listen closely. Yet another of those lines are the same accusations
of disloyalty. Ike was a Communist. John F. Kennedy was a Communist. They said President
Nixon was a tool of international Communism. And when the Cold War was ending they said
Ronald Reagan was "a useful idiot of the Kremlin." Now they are saying that President Obama is
a socialist and at the same time a fascist. They say he's a racist and a secret Muslim. They claim
the President of the United States is not an American. It's so crazy it sounds like a science fiction
novel, but we've heard it all before. The extremists have not changed. From Ike to JFK, from
Nixon to Reagan, and now Obama, it's the same old horsestuff.
For anyone with common sense it might seem like one big joke, a big put-on, or maybe just a big
con job. But it's dangerous. It's toxic. Why? In the name of the founding fathers, the
Constitution and the flag, in the name of taking back our country and restoring it, they would
transform our democracy into something we wouldn't recognize. The extremists of the far right
want to replace the greatest experiment in constitutional democracy with their own far-out
ideology—trashing everything from religious liberty to protections from a dog-eat-dog boom and
bust economy. Public education, a safe environment, national highways, safe transportation,
Social Security, Medicare, health care for all, even the Federal Reserve created to curb economic
chaos—they want to get rid of all of it. If you think that if they had their way they wouldn't kick
the country into an economic abyss, produce another Great Depression, then I've got a reality
show in Alaska for you. And that's not all that's in their sweeping blueprint for power.
The Republican Party is being purged of moderates, responsible conservatives, anyone who has a
thought they don't like. It's divide and conquer. Divide the Republican Party. Divide the nation.
Region against region, South against North, West against East, rural America against cities, state
governments against the federal government, religion against religion, and soon, before you
know it, it won't look or feel like America. Out of loud declarations of love of country, they will
break this country apart.
How far do the extremists want to go? The demonizing of enemies and even religions is a means
to an end. That end is political power. Political power for themselves, for their political leaders—
characters who are hardly outsiders but dusty denizens roaming the corridors of power for.
decades. They want political power—political power for favors, exemptions and loopholes for
the Daddy Warbucks and Scrooge McDucks funding them. Political power for special interests.
Political power against the national interest. Political power against the common good. Political
power against the good society.
President Obama is their target because the people have put him in his office and he stands in the
way of the extremists. They are against him precisely because he's making progress. And
progress is not what they want. They want power for themselves. So they will say anything to
tear down the President. But they are at war with more than President Obama. They are at war
with President Andrew Jackson. That's how far back they want to go. They want to go back the
1830s. They want to go back to before the Civil War, "lips dripping with the words of
interposition and nullification," to quote Martin Luther King, Jr. in his famous "I have a dream"
speech. They want to interpose their rule and their power above that of majority rule and

democratic 2ov-eminent—and nullify the law of the land in the name of their strange doctrines.
So when I say that this is dangerous and toxic, we've been there before. Fanatics have divided
America in the past. We know, as another president said, "A house divided against itself cannot
stand."
And when you see them demonizing the President, Ike, JFK. Obama, take your pick—when you
see them accusing members of the Republican Party of treason—when you hear them compare
the American experiment in democracy to Hitler's Nazi state or Stalin's Communist
totalitarianism—when you hear them talk of "liberty" and they mean taking away Social
Security from people who worked their whole lives to earn it—when you hear them talk of
"freedom" when they want to bring back good old fashioned discrimination—when you hear
them talk of "the Constitution" when they want to get rid of the letter and spirit of the
government designed by the framers of the Constitution—when you hear them talk of
"democracy" when they want to get rid of direct election of senators—when you hear them talk
about "restoration" when they want to gut public education and Medicare and basic economic
and environmental protections--trashing the work and progress of generations--then you know
that behind the patriotic words lies a truly radical agenda.
It was Dwight Eisenhower who warned: "Should any political party attempt to abolish Social
Security, unemployment insurance, and eliminate labor laws and farm programs, you would not
heal• of that party again in our political history. There is a tiny splinter group, of course, that
believes you can do these things. Among them are H. L. Hunt (you possibly know his
background), a few other Texas oil millionaires, and an occasional politician or business man
from other areas. Their number is negligible and they are stupid."
It was John F. Kennedy who said: "In the most critical periods of our nation's history, there have
always been those fringes of our society who have sought to escape their own responsibility by
finding a simple solution, an appealing slogan, or a convenient scapegoat. Financial crises could
be explained by the presence of too many immigrants or too few greenbacks... So let us not heed
these counsels of fear and suspicion... Let our patriotism be reflected in the creation of
confidence rather than crusades of suspicion. Let us prove we think our country great by striving
to make it greater."
Outspoken conservatives like William F. Buckley drew the line and stood up for principle
against the extremists, calling them "idiotic" and "paranoid." Barry Goldwater, at the end of his
life, said, "Do not associate my name with anything you do. You are extremists, and you've hurt
the Republican Party much more than the Democrats have."
Then, this sort of thing, instilling a tone of confidence: Come together, right now...for a new era
of progress...rebuilding America...the work of a new generation...building on the progress of
generations...facing any challenge...resolving that we can and will overcome any
obstacle...keeping the faith, not succumbing to temptations of fear and suspicion...not retreating
but advancing...not dividing the American people for short-term politics but bringing the
American people together for long-term progress...combining our will, our work, our
intelligence, creativity, enterprise, and energy to make a new world of freedom for ourselves and
our children...

G.O.P. Leader Is Tightly Bound to Lobbyists
By ERIC LIPTON
WASHINGTON — House Democrats were preparing late last year for the first floor vote on the financial regulatory
overhaul when Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio and other Republican leaders summoned more than 100 industry
lobbyists to Capitol Hill for a private strategy session.
The bill's passage in the House already seemed inevitable. But Mr. Boehner and his deputies told the Wall Street
lobbyists and trade association leaders that by teaming up, they could still perhaps block its final passage or at least water
it down.
"We need you to get out there and speak up against this," Mr. Boehner said that December afternoon, according to three
people familiar with his remarks, while also warning against cutting side deals with Democrats.
That sort of alliance — they won a few skirmishes, though they lost the war on the regulatory bill — is business as usual
for Mr. Boehner, the House minority leader and would-be speaker if Republicans win the House in November. He
maintains especially tight ties with a circle of lobbyists and former aides representing some of the nation's biggest
businesses, including Goldman Sachs, Google, Citigroup, R. J. Reynolds, MillerCoors and UPS.
They have contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to his campaigns over the years, provided him rides on their
corporate jets, socialized with him at luxury golf resorts and waterfront bashes and are now leading fund-raising efforts for
his Boehner for Speaker campaign, which is soliciting checks of up to $37,800 each, the maximum allowed.
Some of the lobbyists readily acknowledge routinely seeking his office's help — calling the congressman and his aides as
often as several times a week — to advance their agenda in Washington. And in many cases, Mr. Boehner has helped
them out.
As Democrats increasingly try to cast the Ohio congressman as the face of the Republican Party — President Obama
mentioned his name eight times in a speech last week — and as Mr. Boehner becomes more visible, his ties to lobbyists,
cultivated since he arrived here in 1991, are coming under attack.
The woman he hopes to replace, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, derided him on Friday as having met "countless times with
special-interest lobbyists in an effort to stop tough legislation" that would regulate corporations and protect consumers.
And the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, through a spokeswoman, charged that he "epitomizes the
smoked-filled, backroom, special-interest deal making that turns off voters about Washington."
Mr. Boehner, who declined to be interviewed for this article, and his lobbyist allies ridicule such criticism as politically
motivated by desperate Democrats. His actions, they say, simply reflect the pro-business, antiregulatory philosophy that
he has espoused for more than three decades, dating back to when Mr. Boehner, the son of a tavern owner, ran a small
plastics company in Ohio. And fielding requests from lobbyists is nothing unusual, he says.
"I get lobbied every day by somebody," he said last month after a speech in Cleveland. "It could be by my wife. It could be
the bellman. It goes on all day, everyday, everyplace."
Mr. Boehner — a 60-year-old, perpetually tanned, sharply tailored, chain-smoking golfer — is not as fiery as Newt
Gingrich or as unrelenting an arm-twister as Tom DeLay, two of his Republican predecessors in top House posts. It is his
reputation as a "Chamber of Commerce" Republican and his fund-raising skills — he has raised $36 million for
Republican causes during this election cycle, more than almost anyone else in his party — that explain, in part, his rise.
If elected as his party's leader in the House, Mr. Boehner will certainly lean on his industry allies for help as he builds
coalitions necessary to push legislation through Congress, his office acknowledges. His friends say there is nothing wrong
with that.

"Does he have a lot of relationships in this city? Yes, absolutely," said Mark lsakowitz, a friend whose Republican firm
represents more than three dozen financial, telecommunications, energy and consumer products companies as diverse
as Coca-Cola and Zurich Financial Services. "But I think all the good lawmakers do."
Mr. Boehner won some of his first national headlines back in 1996 after he was caught handing out checks from tobacco
lobbyists to fellow Republicans on the House floor. Then the fourth-ranking House Republican, Mr. Boehner said he had
broken no rules and was simply assisting his lobbyist friends, who were contributing to other Republicans' campaigns.
His business-friendly reputation was enhanced through the weekly powwows he organized on Capitol Hill nicknamed the
Thursday Group, a gathering of conservative leaders and business lobbyists whom he relied on to help push the party's
legislative agenda. The Thursday gathering was disbanded after a Republican power struggle that cost him his leadership
position.
But he continued to routinely meet with business leaders, particularly in his role as chairman of the Education and the
Workforce Committee, and returned to power as House G.O.P. leader in 2006. Several of the onetime Thursday regulars,
along with some newcomers, are among the close-knit group that routinely call on Mr. Boehner's office for client matters,
write checks to his campaign and socialize with him.
That tight circle includes Mr. lsakowitz; Bruce Gates, a lobbyist for the cigarette maker Altria; Nicholas E. Calio, a
Citigroup lobbyist; and two former aides, Marc Lampkin and Sam Geduldig, both now financial services lobbyists.
The tobacco industry is particularly well represented, with both Mr. Gates and John Fish, a lobbyist for R. J. Reynolds,
maker of Camel cigarettes, in the group. People affiliated with those companies have contributed at least $340,000 to Mr.
Boehner's political campaigns, with Mr. Gates being the top individual donor among the thousands during Mr. Boehner's
political career, according to a tally by the Center for Public Integrity.
While many lawmakers in each party have networks of donors, lobbyists and former aides who now represent corporate
interests, Mr. Boehner's ties seem especially deep. His clique even has a nickname on Capitol Hill, Boehner Land. The
members of this inner circle said their association with Mr. Boehner translates into open access to him and his staff.
"He likes to bring similarly minded people together to try to advance legislation or oppose it," said Drew Maloney, a
lobbyist at Ogilvy Government Relations. "That is how you get things done."
One lobbyist in the club — after lauding each staff member in Mr. Boehner's office that he routinely calls to ask for help —
ticked off the list of recent issues for which he had won the lawmaker's backing: combating fee increases for the oil
industry, fighting a proposed cap on debit card fees, protecting tax breaks for hedge fund executives and opposing a cap
on greenhouse gas emissions.
Still, with Mr. Boehner and his party in the minority, they often lost the fights.
But despite the recent string of defeats on the House floor, Mr. Boehner has benefited from his alliance with lobbyists.
From 2000 to 2007, Mr. Boehner flew at least 45 times, often with his wife, Debbie, on corporate jets provided by
companies including R. J. Reynolds. (As required, Mr. Boehner reimbursed part of the costs.)
In addition, over the last decade, he has taken 41 other trips paid for by corporate sponsors or industry groups, often to
popular golf spots. Those trips make him one of the top House beneficiaries of such travel, which has recently been
curbed as a result of changes in ethics rules in Washington.
Mr. Boehner continues to travel to popular golf destinations on a corporate-subsidized tab, although now it is paid for
through his political action committee, the Freedom Project. In the last 18 months, it has spent at least $67,000 at the Ritz
Carlton Naples in Florida, at least $20,000 at the Robert Trent Jones Golf Club in Gainesville, Va., and at least $29,000 at
the Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin, Ohio, federal records show, for fund-raising events.
In June, with the prospects for a Republican takeover of the House rising, Mr. Boehner moved to accelerate his fund-
raising effort, starting what he called the Boehner for Speaker campaign. The idea was to use his high profile to draw
large donations that would be mostly allocated to help elect other House Republicans.
He turned again to the same group of lobbyists, former aides and friends during a July meeting at the headquarters of the
Republican National Committee.
"The wave is there, there is a rebellion in the country, and we have good candidates," Mr. Boehner told his supporters,
one of the lobbyists present at the meeting recalled. "But I don't want to miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity because
we have not raised enough money. They might be able to stop us with a wall of money."
Mr. Calio of Citigroup was among the first to write a large check. So far, a party spokesman said, the campaign has raised
nearly $2 million. Mr. Boehner has helped raise millions more in the last six weeks for Republican House candidates
across the country and the party, appearing at more than 40 fund-raisers.
The Boehner for Speaker campaign offers donors who give the maximum amount special perks, like "meetings with
Leader Boehner and much much more."
But his lobbyist friends and former aides said these incentives did not mean too much, because they already had plenty of
access to Mr. Boehner. They just now want to see him as the speaker of the House.
"He knows this is going to be a tough election," said Samuel J. Baptista, a friend, golf partner and lobbyist whose clients
include Goldman Sachs and Discover Financial. "But people who underestimate him really do so at their own peril."

GAME CHANGE: 2012 OFF TO SLOW START – GOP heavyweights hold back, freezing field
compared to past cycles -- Jonathan Martin and Ben Smith: "[T]he primary is on track to start later, and
more cautiously, than it has in the recent past. In the fall of 2006, Mitt Romney and John McCain were openly
battling over endorsements from Republican operatives, donors and even county sheriffs in the early primary
states. The two men beat a well-worn path to New Hampshire, South Carolina, and especially Iowa, where they
had to watch their step to avoid tripping over Democratic hopefuls like John Edwards and Evan Bayh. But at the
same point four years later, as the 2010 election enters the home stretch, top-tier Republican presidential
contenders are hesitant to set foot in the states that kick off the presidential campaign process, let alone issue
press releases touting their latest gets there.
--"[Thell GOP nominating contest is shaping up ... as a game of chicken ... Romney, Sarah Palin, Haley
Barbour, Mitch Daniels and a few other ambitious figures are largely eyeing each other while publicly holding
back, leaving Tim Pawlenty as the only mainstream Republican trudging down the traditional, early path ...
Together, they're all making a mockery of the conventional wisdom about the longer and longer arcs that
modern White House campaigns demand. ... There are three main reasons for the delay: The intense focus on
the 2010 midterms; the risks of starting too early; and, especially for the best-prepared candidate, Romney, a
paralyzing fear of failure in Iowa. In a sense, the incentives this year are reversed: candidates have better
reasons to publicly hold off on declaring their candidacy than to try to gain an early foothold."

STORY DU JOUR – N.Y. Times Al, 1 col. at the fold, "G.O.P. Leader Tightly Bound to Lobbyists," by
Eric Lipton: "Mr. Boehner ... maintains especially tight ties with a circle of lobbyists and former aides
representing some of the nation's biggest businesses ... They have contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars
to his campaigns, provided him with rides on their corporate jets, socialized with him at luxury golf resorts and
waterfront bashes and are now leading fund-raising efforts for his Boehner for Speaker campaign, which is
soliciting checks of up to $37,800 each, the maximum allowed. Some of the lobbyists readily acknowledge
routinely seeking his office's help — calling the congressman and his aides as often as several times a week."

on Boehner": "There is no surer sign that the liberal establishment is threatened by Leader Boehner than the
story that will appear in ... [The] New York Times." http://bit.ly/94TOD
--A BOEHNER AIDE: "Boehner's positions on the issues he cited are longstanding, and are obviously not the
result of one lobbyist's influence. The fact that any reporter would believe or write that Boehner's opposition to
a 'cap and trade' national energy tax, for example, is 1) recent, or 2) the result of one lobbyist's influence is
ridiculous."
--BEHIND THE CURTAIN: Byron York documents changes the NYT made AFTER the story posted:
"Boehner spokesman Michael Steel says he received a fact-checking email from Times reporter Eric Lipton
Friday evening asking if Boehner did in fact oppose the cap on greenhouse gases, the tax change for hedge fund
executives, the debit card fee cap, and increased fees on oil and gas companies. 'Yes, that is correct,' Steel
responded to Lipton, adding 'I can tell you why, if you care.' Steel says he received no further notes from
Lipton. Steel says Boehner has long held those positions and does not hold them as a result of lobbying. Hours
after the email exchange, the Times story was published online, with the statement from the lobbyist that he had

'won' Boehner's backing was changed to one in which a lobbyist 'sought' Boehner's backing. That's a rather
critical change. The Times also added Boehner's defense that these were long-held positions."

increasing pressure to show results to maintain public support for the war, and raises serious concerns about
whether the country can hold legitimate nationwide elections for Parliament next Saturday. Unarmed
government employees can no longer travel safely in 30 percent of the country's 368 districts, according to
published United Nations estimates ... The number of insurgent attacks has increased significantly ... American
military officials say the increased level of violence is related to the rise in the number of its forces here. The
last 2,000 of 30,000 new American troops are expected to arrive in the next week or two, military officials say.
The result is more military operations, they say, and more opportunities for the insurgents to attack coalition

--DOYLE McMANUS, in L.A. Times "Opinion" section, "High-level doubts on Afghanistan: Former
officials who once supported the war are now questioning it's worth the cost": "The doubters include
Richard N. Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, the closest thing the United States has to an
official 'foreign policy establishment'; Leslie H. Gelb, his predecessor; and Robert D. Blackwill, a former aide
to President George W. Bush. 'The current strategy isn't working, and it's costing roughly $100 billion a year,'
Haass, a former aide to then-Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, told me last week. 'It's time for a major
recalibration: not an immediate withdrawal but a significant scaling down of our ambitions.' And last week, a
group of 46 foreign policy experts issued a joint report arguing that the goal of building a unified, stable
Afghanistan is beyond the ability of the United States, and unnecessary to boot. The panel, the Afghanistan
Study Group, included both longtime critics of the war and some who supported U.S. policy until recently. ...
They cite three main reasons for their escalating pessimism. The first: setbacks (including a major offensive in
Kandahar that was scheduled to be in full swing by now but is only getting underway). Next: Afghan President
Hamid Karzai's failure to support a U.S.-sponsored anti-corruption campaign. And finally, there's that $100-
billion annual price tag. ... [A]s Obama approaches a December review of his strategy in Afghanistan, the
debate is noticeably opening up, driven in part by the weight of that $100-billion cost." http://lat.ms/9XfIcyC

TOP TALKERS:
MAUREEN DOWD, "When Peggy Left Barry: Plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose": "One of the
independent voters Obama will be trying to charm over the next two years is my sister, Peggy, a formerly ardent
Obamican (a Republican who changed spots to vote for Obama). ... Despite being a Washington native, Peggy
believed that the dazzling young newcomer could change Washington. But she has lost a lot of faith now,
saying she might vote for Mitt Romney over Obama if Romney is the Republican nominee in 2012. (Sarah
Palin shouldn't count on her vote though. In Peggy's words, 'Are you nuts?') Peggy thinks the president has
done fine managing W.'s messes in Iraq and Afghanistan. And she lights up at the mention of his vice president,
Joe Biden. But she thinks Obama has to get 'a backbone' if he wants to lure her back to the fold. ... While
Obama's out in the country trying to save Congressional Democrats, he should also think about how he's going
to save himself. http://nyti.ms/92Dudr
FRANK RICH, "Time for This Big Dog to Bite Back: The Democrats' obituaries may yet prove
premature.": "On Labor Day, the fighting Obama abruptly re-emerged, a far cry from the man whose Oval
Office address on Iraq days earlier was about as persuasive as a hostage video. ... For a guy facing a tidal wave,
the president was so ebullient, you had to wonder if he knew something we didn't. Maybe he simply read the
unabridged poll numbers ... Those numbers are hardly as monochromatic as advertised. Obama's approval
rating, for months a consistent (not imploding) 45-ish percent, still makes him arguably America's most popular
national politician. The polls also continue to show that, while both political parties are despised, Democrats are
slightly less despised than Republicans. ... In a second forceful speech last week, delivered outside Cleveland,
Obama titillated the political press by calling out Boehner by name eight times. But though Boehner is a nice
soft target ... he's merely a front-man. Obama must also call out the powerful interests who are pulling the
G.O.P.'s strings (and filling its coffers), whether on Wall Street or in Big Oil or any other sector where special
interests are aligned against reform in the public interest. If Obama can speak lucidly about a subject as thorny
as race, he can surely do a far more specific job of telling the story of how we got to this economic impasse."

MEDIA WATCH – "Bret Baier is the new face of Election Night coverage at Fox News: 40-year-old
reporter part of a new generation of political news anchors," by Baltimore Sun's David Zurawik: "Baier
steps up this fall as lead political news anchor on Election Night replacing Brit Hume, who moved after the
2008 elections to the role of senior political analyst. Given the way Fox News has come to lead in ratings for
coverage of political events since CNN's glory days during the presidential campaign of 2008, Baier's ascension
makes for a significant changing of the guard in broadcast journalism. The seat he now occupies in Fox's
Washington studios is one of the most influential in American political life — a fact not lost on the boyish-
looking anchorman who turned 40 on Aug. 4, which also is President Barack Obama's birthday. ... He has been
invited for the first time in his career to moderate a televised debate — a role more often reserved for the likes
of Jim Lehrer or Bob Schieffer of public and network TV. This one will be held Oct. 4 in Hartford, Conn., in a
hotly contested race between Democrat Richard Blumenthal and Republican Linda McMahon for a U.S. Senate
seat. ...
"As for his hour of news from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. weeknights ['Special Report], Baier almost doubles the
combined audience of his competitors on CNN and MSNBC. So far this year, 'Special Report' has an
average nightly audience of 2,107,000 in viewers — compared with 604,000 for 'The Ed Show' on MSNBC
and 545,000 for Wolf Blitzer's 'Situation Room' on CNN. ... Michael Clemente, senior vice president at Fox
News, says the foundation laid down by Hume has played a crucial role in Baler's success. 'Brit Hume had the
legacy with the audience — a legacy that went back to his days with ABC News,' Clemente says. `So why has
it worked with Bret? First of all, the transition was handled well; Bret filled in quite a bit as Brit was winding
down. But people make a judgment pretty quickly, and I think they judged Bret as being an honest, fair and
smart reporter. And it wasn't like pulling some guy out of thin air who had just been a news reader on some
local station.' ... [Baier:] 'You know the Fox Atlanta bureau that I joined in 1998 — that started in my
apartment in Atlanta with a fax machine and a cell phone. That was the bureau. And I still have that sense of us
being that startup that is still trying to make it all come together." http://bit.ly/apgxA2
SPORTS BLINK – COLLEGE FOOTBALL – AP: "Ohio State and Oklahoma won their BCS
championship game rematches and showed that a couple of former powerhouses from the Sunshine State are
not quite ready to return to elite status. Behind the running of Terrelle Pryor and a ball-hawking defense, the
second-ranked Buckeyes beat No. 12 Miami 36-24 on Saturday at the Horseshoe in Columbus. ... In Norman,

The undisciplined style that resulted in multiple costly penalties? That remained consistent as the Trojans
improved to 2-0 under first-year Coach Lane Kiffin. Quarterback Matt Barkley passed for two touchdowns late
in the first half and, though the defense gave up a last-minute touchdown, the Trojans earned a harder-than-
expected victory over the Cavaliers, a near three-touchdown underdog playing their first game in California.

Branding Boehner
RAPIDRESPONSEMEMO•OCTOBER 6 , 2 1 0
ANALYST:DREWWESTEN,PH.D.,WESTENSTRATEGIES
Karl Rove is back in business -- directing tens of millions in secret corporate cash to GOP campaigns to
hijack our elections and our public discourse. If he's successful, John Boehner will become Speaker of the
House. But the last thing Rove wants is for Boehner to be seen as the face of the GOP. That's why he's
claiming it's an —inexplicable— mistake for President Obama to put Boehner front and center. Progressives
know better than to take advice from Rove.
Our new message testing shows that progressives should not only talk about Boehner but define him and
his agenda. Every narrative we tested about Boehner -- from his loyalty to special interests and
corporate donors over the interests of the middle class to Karl Rove's efforts to elevate him as
Speaker -- beat the Republicans" toughest attack language on Obama, Pelosi and Reid. Currently,
Boehner is largely unknown, but when voters are told about him, they don't like what they hear.
The following ""one-liners" beat GOP attack rhetoric by double digits with both likely and swing
votersii:
The brief statements above beat this Republican attack:
"Obama, Pelosi and Reid have abused their power to impose an expansive government and
destroyed our economy in the process. John Boehner and the Republicans won't let them
continue.—
Does Not Speak for Us or Our Values
We need a Speaker who is also a listener, who can hear the voices of ordinary Americans.
I.] The Speaker of the House is a heartbeat away from the Presidency. Unfortunately, we know
where John Boehner"s heart is, and it ish"t with the middle class.
C.,' We need moderation, not extremism. If John Boehner wants to speak for a party that has
vowed to end Social Security, Medicare and public education--and force women who"ve
been raped to bear their rapist's child--that's his business. But he doesn"t speak for America
or American values.
Cares More about Special Interests
LI Ordinary Americans need a Speaker for their interests, not for the interests of billionaires
and corporations that are outsourcing our jobs.
OIt's not hard to keep a tan like John Boehner"s when you"re always out on the golf course with
some CEO or lobbyist.
• It's time we return to government of, by, and for the people, not government of, bought, and
paid for by special interests. But in John Boehner, big business has finally found their man.
Helped Invent the Problems We Face
OJohn Boehner understands deficits. He"s spent nearly 20 years in Washington creating them.
OJohn Boehner knows the ways of Washington. He helped invent them: Earmarks, deficits, and
tax breaks for corporations that outsource our jobs to China.

KEYS TO CONNECTING
1. Emphasize whose voices matter to Boehner: Voters want a Speaker who listens to the voice of the people,
not the big corporations and lobbyists who Boehner represents.

2.Draw a strong contrast between the interests of working Americans and the special interests of powerful
corporations: Speak strongly to populist themes that focus on the loyalty of Boehner and the Republicans in
Congress to their corporate donors, like the tobacco CEOs whose campaign donations Boehner handed out on
the House floor, over the interests and values of ordinary Americans.
3.Focus on realities that are hard for Boehner to defend: the social and economic extremism of his party and
his long history in Washington helping to create the problems we face today.
NARRATIVES THAT BEAT THE GOP ATTACK
Longer narratives against Boehner beat a similar, but more in-depth Republican message, based on language
drawn directly from Boehner and other conservative leaders:
Our top message--exposing Boehner as beholden to special interests--beat the Republicans" attack by 20 points
with swing voters. Our second highest rated message--connecting Karl Rove"s secret efforts to hijack our
elections to Boehner--beat the Republican attack by 15 points with swing voters and was the top rated message
among Democratic likely voters.
i We surveyed a national sample of 1,013 adults matching the demographics of registered voters from October 2-3, 2010
using online dial testing. We
analyzed their responses as they listened to narratives to understand what they found compelling, as well as their overall
ratings of each narrative and
additional "one-liners." The numbers reported here are likely underestimates of the strength of the narratives, as the
statistics refer to the original narratives
tested prior to revising them based on analysis of online dial tests.
ii Swing voters are defined as those who described themselves as anywhere from weak/moderate Republicans through
Independents to weak/moderate
Democrats.
THE REPUBLICAN ATTACK ON OBAMA, PELOS1 AND REID
Obama, Pelosi and Reid have abused their power to impose an expansive and intrusive government and destroyed our
economy in the process. Democrats think they can get away with their job-killing agenda by ramming it down people's
throats, excluding opposing viewpoints and eliminating fair debate. They are turning their backs on American families
and businesses as they continue to tax, borrow and spend into oblivion. John Boehner and the Republicans believe
government should reflect the priorities of the American people--priorities that have been ignored, even mocked by the
powers-that-be in Washington. Obama, Pelosi and Reid must be stopped from raising taxes on any American during a
recession and spending money we don"t have on big government programs no one wants. John Boehner and the
Republicans are listening to the American people and understand that government is not the answer, it's the problem.
"Boehner and Rove"- After the Iraq War went south and the economy went under, most of us
thought we"d never hear again from Karl Rove, the architect of the Bush revolution. But Rove is
back in business, directing tens of millions in secret corporate cash to hijack our elections, running
ads against Members of Congress who want to put the public interest over the special interests.
He and John Boehner aren't working for ordinary Americans. They"re working for the big
corporations that outsource our jobs and get tax breaks for doing it. Boehner"s voted down the
line for big bonuses for bankers, big tax breaks for big oil, and big loopholes for insurance
companies that discriminate against people with "pre-existing conditions" which is all of us if we
just live long enough. We should be restoring the American Dream for all Americans, not just for
the few, and we need a Speaker who stands with the middle class.
"They found their man"- We need to return to government of, by, and for the people, not
government of, bought, and paid for by special interests. It"s time billionaires and big businesses
paid their fair share of taxes rather than paying politicians to give them special tax breaks and
loopholes. They"re putting a lot of money into John Boehner, and for good reason: they know as
Speaker, he"d speak for them, not for ordinary Americans. Just ask the tobacco company CEOs
whose campaign donations he handed out on the floor of the House of Representatives—which is
supposed to be the People's House, not the smokers" lounge. Or ask the bankers who played
Russian roulette with our homes and jobs, who got out their checkbooks as he and his fellow
Republicans held a special meeting with them this summer promising to block any efforts to hold
Wall Street accountable. We need a Speaker whose voice is our voice, who'll spend less time
working on his tan and more time working on the problems of middle class Americans.

According to news reports, today Republican minority leader and Coppertone model John Boehner will give his "closing
argument" to the American people on why they should throw out the Democrats and kill the Obama-Pelosi-Reid "job-
killing agenda." He will be returning to his working class roots, speaking at a piping manufacturing plant, an unusual venue
these days for a man who is seen much more frequently at gatherings of Wall Street executives with open checkbooks
and the males-only country club where he works on his tan when not making the rounds at other clubs with industry
lobbyists.
Either the Speaker-to-be is following the model of Michael Steele and free-lancing, or Karl Rove and the Republicans
believe it is safe or even advantageous to bring him out in public after the White House made an effort to put Boehner's
face on what a Republican majority might look like, with the president invoking his name eight times in one speech.
I have to admit that at the time I was agnostic as to whether it made sense to try to brand him at this late date, as Boehner
has minimal name recognition among voters. But the White House was no doubt responding to three realities.
First, Boehner is an unknown to most Americans, which means that, unlike most Republicans in the news, he has not
been well branded by the GOP -- which means for once Democrats might actually brand someone or something first
rather than playing catch-up. Second, Boehner would indeed be the highest-ranking Republican were the GOP to assume
control over the House (other than of course Karl Rove, who is now directing traffic on the right side of the street in
Washington again). And third, a concrete face is always better than an abstraction when telling a story, and other than
perhaps Sarah Palin, who Republicans could alternately accept and decline as the leader of their party, Boehner's tanned
visage and history as errand-boy for virtually every major corporate special interest in his two decades in Washington
(including his stint as the Marlboro Man, handing out tobacco lobby campaign checks to his fellow Republicans on the
floor of the House) made him a potential counter-villain to the Republican's bogeywoman, Nancy Pelosi.
I remained agnostic until this week, when colleagues at Media Matters Action Network and I conducted a national
5urye:y with 1,000 registered voters, selected to match the demographics of the voting and likely voting
populations. The goal was to see how effectively we could speak with voters about Boehner as not only the symbol and
standard-bearer for the GOP but also the water-boy for corporate America. (The results were surprisingly similar whether
we looked at registered voters or likely voters, although as others have described, precisely how to determine who is a
"likely voter" in this election is as much art as science, and the point of good messaging at this point is actually to change
the dynamics of likely voting, not just to reflect them.)
As detailed in a memo published in Politico, what we found was clear: Boehner is a target well worth defining, who readily
stands for precisely what Americans perceive to be the reasons they would have to hold their noses to vote for
Congressional Republicans (perhaps the only group left who poll worse than Congressional Democrats with swing
voters). We tested both paragraph-length narratives and single-sentence language designed to capture the essence of
those narratives, and in each case, we tested them against the toughest opposition language we could test them against:
the words of Boehner, Cantor, Limbaugh and others combined in defining the "Obama-Pelosi-Reid" agenda.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772555 Date: 08/31/2015
What we found, in brief: is that we could beat a tough GOP narrative about the "job-killing" socialists in the White House
and Congress by 15 to 20 points with two narratives starring Boehner in the leading role (with best supporting bad actor
going in one of the narratives to Karl Rove and his corporate allies), and we could win with over 15 different sentence-long
descriptions of "what's the matter with Boehner" with margins ranging from 10 to 60 points against a tough conservative
attack on the Obama-Pelosi-Reid axis of conservative evil.
The narratives that most moved likely voters -- including swing voters, who preferred them by double-digits over tough
Republican rhetoric -- made clear whose voices Boehner would be speaking for as Speaker (e.g., the Wall Street
executives he convened to try to block Wall Street reform). They harnessed the same populist anger at the hijacking of
Washington by corporate special interests that has enlivened the tea partiers and is palpable across the political
spectrum, and they focused on the extremism of the party Boehner would Speak for. A narrative that brought Karl Rove
into the picture was slightly more polarizing with swing voters but slightly more powerful with likely Democratic voters.
In some ways what was most surprising was the success of the single-line statements of what we need in a Speaker and
who John Boehner really speaks for (although these single-line statements came after the narratives, and likely reflect the
power of branding, even over the course of a brief online encounter with voters). They ranged from relatively lofty and
aspirational (e.g., "We need a Speaker who is also a listener, who can hear the voices of ordinary Americans" -- a theme
colleagues and I found highly resonant across the political spectrum in message testing on the role of money in politics) --
to the harder-edged (e.g., "The Speaker of the House is a heartbeat away from the Presidency. Unfortunately, we know
where John Boehner's heart is, and it isn't with the middle class," or "John Boehner understands deficits. He's spent
nearly 20 years in Washington creating them.")
If there's a message in this message research, it is at once short-term and long-term. In the short run, if Democrats want
to hang onto their seats in November, they would do well to define this election in terms of the middle class and small
business versus the billionaires and big corporations that are hijacking our democracy; to use Boehner as a poster child
for the party whose primary commitment is to the latter and whose tan is a testament to that commitment; and to avoid
giving voters reason to regret their vote if they give it to Democrats again this time, by supporting the things they say they
stand for and avoiding that golden mean between the public interest and the special interests that finance campaigns on
both sides of the aisle.
In the longer run, branding matters. One of the biggest strategic and messaging mistakes of the last two years was the
failure of Democrats to brand their opponents while their opponents were busy branding them -- and in particular the
failure to brand the Bush Recession as the natural consequence of faded Republican economic principles. Two years ago,
that was a virtually uncontested political proposition, as the voters made clear in handing Democrats the White House and
supermajorities in both the House and Senate. Today, the public is split down the middle as to who caused the recession.
Reality doesn't brand itself. Hopefully it won't take a debacle in November and another 10 million jobs lost for reality to
unveil itself again for a brief political moment and for progressives to have a second bite at the apple.

whose primary commitment is to the latter and whose tan is a testament to that commitment; and
to avoid giving voters reason to regret their vote if they give it to Democrats again this time, by
supporting the things they say they stand for and avoiding that golden mean between the public
interest and the special interests that finance campaigns on both sides of the aisle.
In the longer run, branding matters. One of the biggest strategic. and messaging mistakes of the
last two years was the failure of Democrats to brand their opponents while their opponents were
busy branding them -- and in particular the failure to brand the Bush Recess:ion as the natural
consequence of failed Republican economic principles. Two years ago, that was a virtually
uncontested political proposition, as the voters made clear in handing Democrats the White
House and supermajorities in both the House and Senate. Today, the public is split down the
middle as to who caused the recession.
Reality doesn't brand itself Hopefully it won't take a debacle in November and another 10
million jobs lost for reality to unveil itself again for a brief political moment and for progressives
to have a second bite at the apple.

H: Dems should demand Boehner remove this GOP Nazi reenactor. Put Boehner in this
blitzkrieg. Sid
Why is This GOP House Candidate Dressed as
a Nazi?
By Joshua Green
An election year already notable for its menagerie of extreme and unusual candidates can add another one: Rich lott, the
Republican nominee for Congress from Ohio's 9th District, and a Tea Party favorite, who for years donned a German
Waffen SS uniform and participated in Nazi re-enactments.
Rich lott, second from right, in a Nazi SS Waffen uniform.
lott, whose district lies in Northwest Ohio, was involved with a group that calls itself Wiking, whose members are devoted
to re-enacting the exploits of an actual Nazi division, the 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking, which fought mainly on the
Eastern Front during World War 11. lott's participation in the Wiking group is not mentioned on his campaign's website, and
his name and photographs were removed from the Wiking website.When contacted by The Atlantic, lott confirmed his
involvement with the group over a number of years, but said his interest in Nazi Germany was historical and he does not
subscribe to the tenets of Nazism. "No, absolutely not," he said. "In fact, there's a disclaimer on the [Wiking] website. And
you'll find that on almost any reenactment website. it's purely historical interest in World War II."
Rich lott and his wife, as shown on his campaign website.
lott, a member of the Ohio Military Reserve, added, "I've always been fascinated by the fact that here was a relatively
small country that from a strictly military point of view accomplished incredible things. I mean, they took over most of
Europe and Russia, and it really took the combined effort of the free world to defeat them. From a purely historical military
point of view, that's incredible."
lott says the group chose the Wiking division in part because it fought on the Eastern Front, mainly against the Russian

Army, and not U.S. or British soldiers. The group's website includes a lengthy history of the Wiking unit, a recruitment
video, and footage of goose-stepping German soldiers marching in the Warsaw victory parade after Poland fell in 1939.
The website makes scant mention of the atrocities committed by the Waffen SS, and includes only a glancing reference to
the "twisted" nature of Nazism. Instead, it emphasizes how the Wiking unit fought Bolshevist Communism:
Nazi Germany had no problem in recruiting the multitudes of volunteers willing to lay down their lives to
ensure a "New and Free Europe", free of the threat of Communism. National Socialism was seen by -
many in Holland, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and other eastern European and Balkan countries as the
protector of personal freedom and their very way of life, despite the true underlying totalitarian (and quite
twisted, in most cases) nature of the movement. Regardless, thousands upon thousands of valiant men
died defending their respective countries in the name of a better tomorrow. We salute these idealists; no
matter how unsavory the Nazi government was, the front-line soldiers of the Waffen-SS (in particular the
foreign volunteers) gave their lives for their loved ones and a basic desire to be free.
Historians of Nazi Germany vehemently dispute this characterization. "These guys don't know their history," said Charles
W. Sydnor, Jr., a retired history professor and author of "Soldiers of Destruction: The SS Death's Head Division, 1933-45,"
which chronicles an SS division. "They have a sanitized, romanticized view of what occurred." Sydnor added that re-
enactments like the Wiking group's are illegal in Germany and Austria. "If you were to put on an SS uniform in Germany
today, you'd be arrested."

Christopher Browning, a professor of history at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, said, "It is so unhistorical and
so apologetic that you don't know to what degree they've simply caught up innocent war memorabilia enthusiasts who
love putting on uniforms."
loft says he does not recall exactly when he joined the Wiking group (his name appears on a unit roster as far back as
2003), but did so with his son "as a father-son bonding thing." He says his name and pictures were removed from the
Wiking website not out of concern that they would harm his political career, but because he quit the group three years
ago, after his son lost interest.
loft participated in the group under his own name, and also under the alias "Reinhard Pferdmann," which has also been
removed, and which lott described as being his German alter ego. "Part of the reenactor's [experience]," lott said, "is the
living-history part, of really trying to get into the persona of the time period. In many, not just in our unit, but in many units
what individuals do is create this person largely based on a Germanized version of their name, and a history kind of based
around your own real experiences. 'Reinhard' of course is 'Richard' in German. And 'Pferdmann,"pferd' is a horse. So it's
literally 'horse man."
Asked whether his participation in a Nazi re-enactor's group might not upset voters, particularly Jewish voters, loft said he
hoped it would not: "They have to take it in context. There's reenactors out there who do everything. You couldn't do Civil
War re-enacting if somebody didn't play the role of the Confederates. [This] is something that's definitely way in the past.
... [I hope voters] take it in context and see it for what it is, an interest in World War II history. And that's strictly all."

lott at Nazi re-enactment.
Rabbi Moshe Saks, of the Congregation B'nai Israel in Sylvania, Ohio, a suburb of Toledo that sits in the 9th district,
disagreed. "Any kind of reenactment or glorification of Nazi Germany, to us, would be something unacceptable and
certainly in poor taste, if not offensive," he said. "I think the reaction here will be very negative. And not just among the
Jewish community, but the broader community."
In a follow-up email today, loft seemed at pains to address concerns that his conduct may have alienated veterans groups
but made no specific mention of possible offense to Jews or human rights groups: "Never, in any of my reenacting of
military history, have I meant any disrespect to anyone who served in our military or anyone who has been affected by the

tragedy of war. In fact, I have immense respect for veterans who served our country valiantly, and my respect of the
military and our veterans is one of the reasons I have actively studied military history throughout my life." He added that
he has participated in re-enactments as a Civil War Union infantryman, a World War I dough boy and World War II
American infantryman and paratrooper.
The actual Wiking unit has a history as grisly as that of other Nazi divisions. In her book "The Death Marches of
Hungarian Jews Through Austria in the Spring of 1945," Eleonore Lappin, the noted Austrian historian, writes that soldiers
from the Wiking division were involved in the killing of Hungarian Jews in March and April 1945, before surrendering to
American forces in Austria.
"What you often hear is that the [Wiking] division was never formally accused of anything, but that's kind of a dodge," says
Prof. Rob Citino, of the Military History Center at the University of North Texas, who examined the Wiking website. "The
entire German war effort in the East was a racial crusade to rid the world of 'subhumans,' Slays were going to be enslaved
in numbers of tens of millions. And of course the multimillion Jewish population of Eastern Europe was going to be
exterminated altogether. That's what all these folks were doing in the East. It sends a shiver up my spine to think that
people want to dress up and play SS on the weekend."

According to news reports, today Republican minority leader and Coppertone model John
Boehner will give his "closing argument" to the American people on why they should throw out
the Democrats and kill the Obama-Pelosi-Reid "job-killing agenda." He will be returning to his
working class roots, speaking at a piping manufacturing plant, an unusual venue these days for a
man who is seen much more frequently at gatherings of Wall Street executives with open
checkbooks and the males-only country club where he works on his tan when not making the
rounds at other clubs with industry lobbyists.
Either the Speaker-to-be is following the model of Michael Steele and free-lancing, or Karl Rove
and the Republicans believe it is safe or even advantageous to bring him out in public after the
White House made an effort to put Boehner's face on what a Republican majority might look
like, with the president invoking his name eight times in one speech.
I have to admit that at the time I was agnostic as to whether it made sense to try to brand him at
this late date, as Boehner has minimal name recognition among voters. But the White House was
no doubt responding to three realities.
First, Boehner is an unknown to most Americans, which means that, unlike most Republicans in
the news, he has not been well branded by the GOP -- which means for once Democrats might
actually brand someone or something first rather than playing catch-up. Second, Boehner would
indeed be the highest-ranking Republican were the GOP to assume control over the House (other
than of course Karl Rove, who is now directing traffic on the right side of the street in
Washington again). And third, a concrete face is always better than an abstraction when telling a
story, and other than perhaps Sarah PalM, who Republicans could alternately accept and decline
as the leader of their party, Boehner's tanned visage and history as errand-boy for virtually every
major corporate special interest in his two decades in Washington (including his stint as the
Marlboro Man, handing out tobacco lobby campaign checks to his fellow Republicans on the
floor of the House) made him a potential counter-villain to the Republican's bogeywoman,
Nancy Pelosi.
I remained agnostic until this week, when colleagues at Media Matters Action Network and I
conducted a national messaging survey
<http://cloudfront.mediamattersaction.orgistatic/images/pdf/BrandingBoehner.pdf with 1,000
registered voters, selected to match the demographics of the voting and likely voting populations.
The goal was to see how effectively we could speak with voters about Boehner as not only the
symbol and standard-bearer for the GOP but also the water-boy for corporate America. (The
results were surprisingly similar whether we looked at registered voters or likely voters, although
as others have described, precisely how to determine who is a "likely voter" in this election is as
much art as science, and the point of good messaging at this point is actually to change the
dynamics of likely voting, not just to reflect them.)
As detailed in a memo published in Politico, what we found was clear: Boehner is a target well
worth defining, who readily stands for precisely what Americans perceive to be the reasons they
would have to hold their noses to vote for Congressional Republicans (perhaps the only group
left who poll worse than Congressional Democrats with swing voters). We tested both
paragraph-length narratives and single-sentence language designed to capture the essence of
those narratives, and in each case, we tested them against the toughest opposition language we
could test them against: the words of Boehner, Cantor, Limbaugh and others combined in
defining the "Obama-Pelosi-Reid" agenda.
What we found, in brief, is that we could beat a tough GOP narrative about the "job-killing"
socialists in the White House and Congress by 15 to 20 points with two narratives starring
Boehner in the leading role (with best supporting bad actor going in one of the narratives to Karl
Rove and his corporate allies), and we could win with over 15 different sentence-long
descriptions of "what's the matter with Boehner" with margins ranging from 10 to 60 points
against a tough conservative attack on the Obama-Pelosi-Reid axis of conservative evil.
The narratives that most moved likely voters -- including swing voters, who preferred them by
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772653 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772653 Date: 08/31/2015
double-digits over tough Republican rhetoric -- made clear whose voices Boehner would be
speaking for as Speaker (e.g., the Wall Street executives he convened to try to block Wall Street
reform). They harnessed the same populist anger at the hijacking of Washington by corporate
special interests that has enlivened the tea partiers and is palpable across the political spectrum,
and they focused on the extremism of the party Boehner would Speak for. A narrative that
brought Karl Rove into the picture was slightly more polarizing with swing voters but slightly
more powerful with likely Democratic voters.
In some ways what was most surprising was the success of the single-line statements of what we
need in a Speaker and who John Boehner really speaks for (although these single-line statements
came after the narratives, and likely reflect the power of branding, even over the course of a brief
online encounter with voters). They ranged from relatively lofty and aspirational (e.g., "We need
a Speaker who is also a listener, who can hear the voices of ordinary Americans" -- a theme
colleagues and I found highly resonant across the political spectrum in message testing on the
role of money in politics) -- to the harder-edged (e.g., "The Speaker of the House is a heartbeat
away from the Presidency. Unfortunately, we know where John Boehner's heart is, and it isn't
with the middle class," or "John Boehner understands deficits. He's spent nearly 20 years in
Washington creating them.")
If there's a message in this message research, it is at once short-term and long-term. In the short
run, if Democrats want to hang onto their seats in November, they would do well to define this
election in terms of the middle class and small business versus the billionaires and big
corporations that are hijacking our democracy; to use Boehner as a poster child for the party
whose primary commitment is to the latter and whose tan is a testament to that commitment; and
to avoid giving voters reason to regret their vote if they give it to Democrats again this time, by
supporting the things they say they stand for and avoiding that golden mean between the public
interest and the special interests that finance campaigns on both sides of the aisle.
In the longer run, branding matters. One of the biggest strategic and messaging mistakes of the
last two years was the failure of Democrats to brand their opponents while their opponents were
busy branding them -- and in particular the failure to brand the Bush Recession as the natural
consequence of failed Republican economic principles. Two years ago, that was a virtually
uncontested political proposition, as the voters made clear in handing Democrats the White
House and supermajorities in both the House and Senate. Today, the public is split down the
middle as to who caused the recession.
Reality doesn't brand itself. Hopefully it won't take a debacle in November and another 10
million jobs lost for reality to unveil itself again for a brief political moment and for progressives
to have a second bite at the apple.

The Political Scene
Confounding Fathers
The Tea Party's Cold War roots.
by Sean Wilentz October 18, 2010
ann Beck's view of American history stems from the paranoid politics of the fifties.
A few months ago, the cable-television and radio host Glenn Beck began his Fox News show with one of his favorite
props: a pipe clenched between his teeth. "I've got my pipe," he told his audience, his speech slightly muddled by the
stem, "because we're going to speak about schoolish kind of things." The theme of the day was "Restoring History," and
Beck, looking professorial in a neat dark blazer and a pink button-down shirt, began the lesson by peering at a stack of
history textbooks and pronouncing them full of falsehoods, produced by "malicious progressive intent." Progressives, he
explained—liberals, socialists, Communists, the entire spectrum of the left—"knew they had to separate us from our
history to be able to separate us from our Constitution and God." For the next hour, Beck earnestly explained some of the
history that "is being stolen from us": the depression of 1920, for example, or how conservative economics saved the
nation from the "near-depression" of 1946—crises that progressives don't want you to know about. "You've been taught
one lie, I think, your whole life," he said.
For the fractious Tea Party movement, Beck—a former drive-time radio jockey, a recovering alcoholic, and a Mormon
convert—has emerged as both a unifying figure and an intellectual guide. One opinion poll, released in July by
Democracy Corps, showed that he is "the most highly regarded individual among Tea Party supporters," seen not merely
as an entertainer, like Rush Limbaugh, but as an "educator." And in the past few months Beck has established his own
institute of learning: the online, for-profit Beck University. Enrollees can take courses like Faith 102, which contends with
"revisionists and secular progressives" about the separation of church and state; Hope 102, an attack on the activist
federal government; and the combined Charity 101/102/103, a highly restrictive interpretation of rights, federalism, and the
division of powers.
During the "Restoring History" episode, Beck twice encouraged viewers to join his Web seminars, where they can hear
"lessons from the best and brightest historians and scholars that we could find." The B.U. faculty consists of three
members, including one bona-fide academic, James R. Stoner, Jr., the chair of the political-science department at
Louisiana State University; the other two are the head of a management consulting firm and the founder of WallBuilders,
which the Web site calls "a national pro-family organization." Beck himself often acts as a professor, a slightly jocular one,
on his Fox News program. Surrounded by charts and figures, he offers explanations of current politics and history lessons
about the country's long march to Obama-era totalitarianism. The decline, he says, began with the Progressive era of the
early twentieth century, in particular with the Presidency of Woodrow Wilson, when both the Federal Reserve System and
the graduated federal income tax came into existence. "Wilson," Beck told his radio audience in August, "just despised
what America was."

Beck's claims have found an audience among Tea Party spokesmen and sympathizers. At the movement's Freedom
Summit in Washington last September, one activist told a reporter, "The election between Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow
Wilson in 1912 was when it started going downhill." And in April an angry member of the Tea Party Patriots group from
Cape Fear, North Carolina, claimed on the group's Web site that "the very things you see happening in this country today
started with the Wilson Administration."
At a Tax Day rally this past spring, the veteran conservative organizer Richard Viguerie described the Tea Party as "an
unfettered new force of the middle class." And, indeed, calling Obama a socialist in the tradition of Woodrow Wilson is
audacious enough to seem like the marker of a new movement—or, at least, a new twist in the nation's long history of
conspiracy-mongering. In fact, it marks a revival of ideas that circulated on the extremist right half a century ago,
especially in the John Birch Society and among its admirers.
Beck's version of American history relies on lessons from his own acknowledged inspiration, the late right-wing writer W.
Cleon Skousen, and also restates charges made by the Birch Society's founder, Robert Welch. The political universe is,
of course, very different today from what it was during the Cold War. Yet the Birchers' politics and their view of American
history—which focussed more on totalitarian threats at home than on those posed by the Soviet Union and Communist
China—has proved remarkably persistent. The pressing historical question is how extremist ideas held at bay for decades
inside the Republican Party have exploded anew—and why, this time, Party leaders have done virtually nothing to
challenge those ideas, and a great deal to abet them.
The early nineteen-sixties were a turbulent time in American politics, for the right wing in particular. In the South, racist
violence against civil-rights workers was constant, deepening sectional splits in the Democratic Party that would in time
deliver the once solidly Democratic South to the Republicans. Southern elected officials, in support of what they called
"massive resistance" to civil-rights laws and judicial rulings, resurrected the ideas of nullification and interposition, which
claimed that individual states could void federal laws within their own borders. Others focussed on what they considered a
fearsome Communist menace inside the United States. General Edwin A. Walker caused an enormous stir when he
resigned from the Army in 1961, after President John F. Kennedy's Pentagon reprimanded him for spreading right-wing
propaganda among his troops and accusing prominent American officials of Communist sympathies. Senator Strom
Thurmond, the Dixiecrat from South Carolina, spoke for many on the far right when he declared that various modestly
liberal domestic programs "fall clearly within the category of socialism."
The John Birch Society was one of the decade's most controversial right-wing organizations. Founded in 1958 by Robert
Welch, a candy manufacturer from Massachusetts, the society took its name from a Baptist missionary and military-
intelligence officer killed by Communist Chinese forces in 1945, whom Welch called the first American casualty of the
Cold War. The group was founded at a propitious time. After Senator Joseph McCarthy's fall, in 1954, many of McCarthy's
followers felt bereft of a voice, and Welch seemed to speak for them; by the mid-sixties, his society's membership was
estimated to be as high as a hundred thousand. Welch, exploiting fears of what McCarthy had called an "immense"
domestic conspiracy, declared that the federal government had already fallen into the Communists' clutches. In a tract
titled "The Politician," he attacked President Dwight D. Eisenhower as "a dedicated, conscious agent of the Communist
conspiracy" who had been serving the plot "all of his adult life." Late in 1961, after the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion, he
accused the Kennedy Administration of "helping the Communists everywhere in the world while pretending to do the
opposite."
Wherever he looked, Welch saw Communist forces manipulating American economic and foreign policy on behalf of
totalitarianism. But within the United States, he believed, the subversion had actually begun years before the Bolshevik
Revolution. Conflating modern liberalism and totalitarianism, Welch described government as "always and inevitably an
enemy of individual freedom." Consequently, he charged, the Progressive era, which expanded the federal government's
role in curbing social and economic ills, was a dire period in our history, and Woodrow Wilson "more than any other one
man started this nation on its present road to totalitarianism."
In the nineteen-sixties, Welch became convinced that even the Communist movement was but "a tool of the total
conspiracy." This master conspiracy, he said, had forerunners in ancient Sparta, and sprang fully to life in the eighteenth
century, in the "uniformly Satanic creed and program" of the Bavarian Illuminati. Run by those he called "the Insiders," the
conspiracy resided chiefly in international families of financiers, such as the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers, government
agencies like the Federal Reserve System and the Internal Revenue Service, and nongovernmental organizations like the
Bilderberg Group, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Trilateral Commission. Since the early twentieth century, they
had done a good deal of their evil work under the guise of humanitarian uplift. "One broad avenue down which these
conspiratorial forces advance was known as progressive legislation," Welch declared in 1966. "The very same collectivist
theories and demagogic pretenses which had destroyed earlier civilizations were now paraded forth in the disguise of new
and modern concepts."
In the worst case, Welch believed, military action might be necessary to dislodge the totalitarians. But for the moment a
nonviolent political revolution would suffice. Accordingly, he designed the Birch Society roughly, if not explicitly, on the
Marxist-Leninist model of a vanguard revolutionary party: a series of small cells that would work in secret to agitate the
populace and elect right-thinking candidates to office. "It isn't numbers we have to worry about," Welch wrote, "but the
courage on the part of our followers to stick their necks out and play rough—the same as the Communists do."
The "Founder" himself would dictate the society's policies, advised by a council of about two dozen businessmen and
professionals, and the local cells would be overseen by unyielding commanders. "It is the leadership that is most
demanding, most exacting of its followers," Welch observed, "that achieves really dedicated support." Welch's group

became synonymous with right-wing extremism, earning satirical blasts from critics ranging from the cartoonist Walt Kelly
to the musicians Bob Dylan and Dizzy Gillespie. The trumpeter, whose actual name was John Birks Gillespie, made a
humorous run for the Presidency in 1964, organizing John Birks Societies in twenty-five states.
Still, the most outlandish of the era's right-wing anti-Communists was not Welch but Willard Cleon Skousen. A
transplanted Canadian who served as a Mormon missionary in his teens, Skousen was considered so radical in the early
nineteen-sixties that even J. Edgar Hoover's F.B.I. watched him closely; one 1962 memo in his extensive F.B.I. file noted
that "during the past year or so, Skousen has affiliated himself with the extreme right-wing 'professional communists' who
are promoting their own anticommunism for obvious financial purposes." Skousen was himself employed by the F.B.I.,
from 1935 until 1951, much of that time as a special agent working chiefly in administration. These desk jobs, he claimed
implausibly, gave him access to confidential domestic intelligence about Communism. Skousen also maintained that he
had served as Hoover's administrative assistant; Hoover informed inquirers that there was no such position.
Skousen taught for years in the speech and religion departments at Brigham Young University, interrupted by a stint, from
1956 to 1960, as the police chief of Salt Lake City. His time in office was contentious, and after he raided a friendly card
game attended by the city's right-wing mayor, J. Bracken Lee, he was promptly fired. Lee called Skousen "a master of half
truths" and said that he ran the police department "like a Gestapo"; Skousen's supporters placed burning crosses on the
Mayor's lawn.
After losing his police job, Skousen founded a group called the All-American Society, which Time described in 1961 as an
exemplar of the far-right "ultras." Although he did not join the Birch Society, Skousen worked with its American Opinion
Speakers' Bureau, and, in 1963, wrote a rousing tract titled "The Communist Attack on the John Birch Society," which
condemned the society's critics for "promoting the official Communist Party line." (This was a tic of Skousen's; he later
defended the Mormon policy of denying the priesthood to blacks with a pamphlet called "The Communist Attack on the
Mormons.")
All along, Skousen's evolving thoughts ran in tandem with Welch's. In "The Naked Communist," a lengthy primer
published in 1958, he enlivened a survey of the worldwide leftist threat with outlandish claims, writing that F.D.R.'s adviser
Harry Hopkins had treasonously delivered to the Soviets a large supply of uranium, and that the Russians built the first
Sputnik with plans stolen from the United States. A year before Richard Condon's novel "The Manchurian Candidate"
appeared, Skousen announced that the Communists were creating "a regimented breed of Pavlovian men whose minds
could be triggered into immediate action by signals from their masters." A later book, "The Naked Capitalist," decried the
Ivy League Establishment, who, through the Federal Reserve, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Rockefeller
Foundation, formed "the world's secret power structure." The conspiracy had begun, Skousen wrote, when reformers like
the wealthy banker Edward M. (Colonel) House, a close adviser to President Woodrow Wilson, helped put into place the
Federal Reserve and the graduated income tax.
In 1971, Skousen organized another group, the Freemen Institute, which he later renamed the National Center for
Constitutional Studies. According to an article published in the Review of Religious Research, the center's targets
included "the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal
Communication Commission's fairness doctrine in editorial broadcasting, the federal government's change of the gold
standard in currency, all subsidies to farmers, all federal aid to education, all federal social welfare, foreign aid, social
security, elimination of public school prayer and Bible reading, and (that familiar right-wing nemesis) the United Nations."
Skousen's pronouncements made him a pariah among most conservative activists, including some on the right-wing
fringe. In 1962, the ultraconservative American Security Council threw him out, because members felt that he had "gone
off the deep end." In 1971, a review in the Mormon journal Dialogue accused Skousen of "inventing fantastic ideas and
making inferences that go far beyond the bounds of honest commentary," and advancing doctrines that came "perilously
close" to Nazism. And in 1979, after Skousen called President.Jimmy Carter a puppet of the Council on Foreign Relations
and the Rockefeller family, the president of the Mormon church issued a national order banning announcements about his
organizations.
Skousen was undeterred. In 1981, he produced "The 5,000 Year Leap," a treatise that assembles selective quotations
and groundless assertions to claim that the U.S. Constitution is rooted not in the Enlightenment but in the Bible, and that
the framers believed in minimal central government. Either proposition would have astounded James Madison, often
described as the guiding spirit behind the Constitution, who rejected state-established religions and, like Alexander
Hamilton, proposed a central government so strong that it could veto state laws. "The 5,000 Year Leap" is not a fervid
book. Instead, it is calmly, ingratiatingly misleading. Skousen quotes various eighteenth-century patriots on the evils of
what Samuel Adams, in 1768, called "the Utopian schemes of leveling," which Skousen equates with redistribution of
wealth. But he does not mention the Founders' endorsement of taxing the rich to support the general welfare. Thomas
Jefferson, for example, wrote approvingly in 1811 of having federal taxes (then limited to tariffs) fall solely on the wealthy,
which meant that "the farmer will see his government supported, his children educated, and the face of his country made
a paradise by the contributions of the rich alone, without his being called on to spend a cent from his earnings."
Skousen also challenges the separation of church and state, asserting that "the Founders were not indulging in any idle
gesture when they adopted the motto 'In God We Trust.' "In reality, the motto that came out of the Constitutional
Convention was "E Pluribus Unum": out of many, one. "In God We Trust" came much later; its use on coins was first
permitted in 1864, and only in 1955, at the height of the Cold War, did Congress mandate that it appear on all currency.
The following year, President Eisenhower—who Welch charged was a Communist agent—approved "In God We Trust" as
the national motto.

In 1982, Skousen published a follow-up work, an ancestor-worshipping history text titled The Making of America," and
prepared a study guide for nationwide seminars based on its contents. As Alexander Zaitchik reports in his informative
study of Beck, "Common Nonsense," the new book became an object of controversy in 1987, after the California
Bicentennial Commission sold it as part of a fund-raising drive. Among its offenses was an account of slavery drawn from
long-disgraced work by the historian Fred A. Shannon, which characterized slave children as "pickaninnies" and
suggested that the worst victims of slavery were the slaveholders themselves. The constitutional scholar Jack Rakove, of
Stanford, inspected Skousen's book and seminars and pronounced them "a joke that no self-respecting scholar would
think is worth a warm pitcher of spit."
By the time Skousen died, in 2006, he was little remembered outside the ranks of the furthest-right Mormons. Then, in
2009, Glenn Beck began touting his work: "The Naked Communist," "The Naked Capitalist," and, especially, "The 5,000
Year Leap," which he called "essential to understanding why our Founders built this Republic the way they did." After
Beck put the book in the first spot on his required-reading list—and wrote an enthusiastic new introduction for its reissue—
it shot to the top of the Amazon best-seller list. In the first half of 2009, it sold more than two hundred and fifty thousand
copies. Local branches of the Tea Party Patriots, the United American Tea Party, and other groups across the country
have since organized study groups around it. "It is time we learn and follow the FREEDOM principles of our Founding
Fathers," a United American Tea Party video declares, referring to the principles expounded by Skousen's book. If Beck is
the movement's teacher, "The 5,000 Year Leap" has become its primer, with "The Making of America" as a kind of 102-
level text.
The popularity of Beck's broadcasts, which now reach two million viewers each day, has brought neo-Birchite ideas to an
audience beyond any that Welch or Skousen might have dreamed of. Several times a week, Beck informs his audience
that socialists (whom he also sometimes calls Fascists or Communists) led by Obama have seized power, and that
patriotic Americans must take their country back. His TV show for some time featured "Comrade Updates," in which Beck
described perfidy while the Soviet anthem played in the background. He attacks all the familiar bogeymen: the Federal
Reserve System (which he asserts is a private conglomerate, unaccountable to the public); the Council on Foreign
Relations (born of a "progressive idea" to manipulate the media in order to "let the masses know what should be done");
and a historical procession of evildoers, including Skousen's old target Colonel House and Welch's old target Woodrow
Wilson. His sources on these matters, quite apart from Skousen's books, can be unreliable. On September 22nd, amid a
diatribe about House, Beck cited a passage from "Secrets of the Federal Reserve," by Eustace Mullins. The book,
commissioned in 1948 by Ezra Pound, is a startlingly anti-Semitic fantasy of how a Jewish-led conspiracy of all-powerful
bankers established the Federal Reserve in service of their plot to dominate the world.
Part of Beck's allure is the promise that he will reveal secret information. In one segment last year, he produced a drawing
of fasces—which he described, anachronistically, as "the Roman symbol of Fascism"—and then a picture of an old
Mercury dime, with fasces on the reverse side. "Who brought this dime in? It happened in 1916—Woodrow Wilson was
the President," he said. "We've been on the road to Fascism for a while." Benito Mussolini, of course, didn't adopt the
ancient symbol of authority as the Fascist emblem until the nineteen-twenties; the designer of the coin, the sculptor
Adolph A. Weinman, intended it to signify the nation's military preparedness, and paired it with an olive branch to illustrate
the desire for peace.
Beck's readings of Progressive-era politics are nearly as bizarre. Whatever can be said about Theodore Roosevelt, he
was not a crypto-radical. It was Roosevelt who coined the term "lunatic fringe" to describe the extreme leftists of his day,
and his concept of New Nationalism—in which an activist government built a vibrant capitalism, partly by regulating big
business—looked back to Alexander Hamilton, not Karl Marx. Nor was Wilson a Bolshevik; in fact, in 1917 he sent
American troops to Russia to support the anti-Bolshevik White Army. At home, his reforms sought to break up monopolies
in order to restore competition among small companies. "If America is not to have free enterprise," Wilson declared, "then
she can have no freedom of any sort whatever."
In 2007, Beck, then the host of "Glenn Beck," on CNN's Headline News, brought to his show a John Birch Society
spokesman named Sam Antonio, who warned of a government plot to abolish U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada,
"and eventually all throughout the Americas." Beck told Antonio, "When I was growing up, the John Birch Society—I
thought they were a bunch of nuts." But now, he said, "you guys are starting to make more and more sense to me." His
guest beamed. "Yes, we at the John Birch Society are not nuts," Antonio said. "We are just exposing the truth that's been
out there for many, many years." Since then, the Birch Society's Web site has run clips from Beck's Fox broadcasts,
proudly pointing out similarities with their own ideas. Last June, an essay on the site described a presentation by Beck on
Communism in America as "the ultimate in complete agreement between the Beck and JBS presentations of American
history."
Beck has also praised Ezra Taft Benson, one of Skousen's close associates. Benson, the Secretary of Agriculture under
President Eisenhower and the thirteenth president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, gained notoriety for
a speech in 1966 in which he denounced Democratic officeholders and intellectuals (including the historian Arthur M.
Schlesinger, Jr.) as socialists and Communist sympathizers, warned that "the Constitution will be endangered and hang,
as it were, by a single thread," and praised the John Birch Society as "the most effective non-church organization in our
fight against creeping socialism and Godless Communism." Last June, Beck aired a clip from another Benson speech,
intoning, "Ezra Taft Benson warned about what was coming." The Birch Society's Web site subsequently praised Beck for
"getting progressively (sorry for the bad word choice) closer to presenting American history in the way that The John Birch
Society has been doing it for over 50 years."

Beck is no more the sole representative of today's multifaceted Tea Party than Welch or Skousen was of the nineteen-
sixties far right; he recently told the Times, a bit disingenuously, that he was "not involved with the Tea Party." Why, then,
have the politics of Skousen, Benson, and the John Birch Society had such a resurgence among conservative
Republicans—not just through Beck but through Tea Party heroes like the Nevada Republican Senate candidate Sharron
Angle? (Last month, Angle gave a warm address to a "freedom conference" in Salt Lake City, co-sponsored by the John
Birch Society and Skousen's old group, the National Center for Constitutional Studies, praising her audience as
"mainstream America" and patriots who had "heard the call.") The columnist Frank Rich, among others, has suggested
that the election of a black President sowed "fears of disenfranchisement among a dwindling and threatened minority in
the country." There are signs that this is so: Republicans' singling out of Thurgood Marshall as an "activist Justice" during
Elena Kagan's Supreme Court confirmation hearings, the warnings on Fox News about the terrible dangers posed by the
minuscule New Black Panther Party. But "socialist" is not a racial slur. Jim Crow was not built out of fears of the Federal
Reserve and the I.R.S. The Tea Party's fulminations against cap-and-trade, federal-government bailouts, and big
government generally play on very old themes that have nothing to do with the color of President Obama's skin.
The current right-wing resurgence has more to do with the inner dynamics of American conservatism in the past half
century. In the nineteen-fifties and nineteen-sixties, the far right was condemned by liberals, as might be expected; in
November, 1961, President Kennedy devoted part of a speech in Los Angeles to denouncing those "discordant voices of
extremism" that "equate the Democratic Party with the welfare state, the welfare state with socialism, and socialism with
Communism." But the Bircher right also provoked deep anxiety among conservatives, who feared being perceived as
paranoids and conspiracy-mongers.
The leading intellectual spokesman and organizer of the anti-Bircher conservatives was William F. Buckley, Jr., the editor
of National Review. Buckley was by no means moderate in his conservatism. He was a lifelong defender of Joseph
McCarthy and a foe of New Deal liberalism. But he drew the line at claiming that the course of American government was
set by a socialist conspiracy, and he feared that the ravings of the extreme right would cost more balanced, practical
conservatives their chance at national power. "By 1961," his biographer John B. Judis writes, "Buckley was beginning to
worry that with the John Birch Society growing so rapidly, the right-wing upsurge in the country would take an ugly, even
Fascist turn rather than leading toward the kind of conservatism National Review had promoted." In the next two decades,
with Buckley's support and counsel, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan completed a conservative revolution that
succeeded by keeping extremist elements far from the centers of power.
As confidant and adviser to leading conservative politicians, Buckley had far more political influence than might be
expected from the editor of a weekly journal. Yet in the early nineteen-sixties he found fighting the Birchers and their
fellow-travellers extremely difficult. Even though some of Buckley's colleagues at National Review thought that the Birch
Society went too far, they would not attack the society publicly, for fear of alienating both the Birchers and the
conservatives who sympathized with their views. When Buckley wrote an editorial in 1962 that accused Welch of
"distorting reality" and failing to make "the crucial moral and political distinction" between Communists and liberals, the
magazine immediately lost subscriptions and financial support.
By 1960, Senator Barry Goldwater, of Arizona, was emerging as the great political hope of conservative Republicans, and
he consulted closely with Buckley. At a meeting at the Breakers hotel, in Palm Beach, in January, 1962, Buckley urged
Goldwater to repudiate the Birch Society. Goldwater demurred; though he conceded that some embarrassing "kooks"
lurked among the Birchers, he insisted to Buckley that there were also some "nice guys," and that it would be injudicious
to attack the group in public. The Birchers' support helped gain Goldwater the Republican Presidential nomination in
1964, and he winked at them in his acceptance speech with his famous line: "Extremism in the defense of liberty is no
vice. . . . Moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue."
In the general election, though, Goldwater suffered a crushing loss to Lyndon Johnson, partly because Democrats
succeeded in making him look like a captive of the loony right. (To the Goldwater slogan "In Your Heart, You Know He's
Right," the Democrats shot back, "In Your Guts, You Know He's Nuts.") Buckley's fears had been confirmed. But he was
undeterred in his efforts to build a respectable and viable conservative movement. In 1967, he favored Richard Nixon
among a field of Republican aspirants. He liked Ronald Reagan's politics, but considered Reagan, who had only recently
been elected the governor of California, too new to national politics. George Romney, the governor of Michigan, a wishy-
washy moderate, was obviously unsuitable, to say nothing of the Republican archliberal Nelson Rockefeller, of New York.
Nixon was a hard-nosed Republican with strong conservative views, especially on Communism and the Cold War; he had
established himself as a Communist-hunter in the nineteen-forties by pressing the charge that Alger Hiss, a former official
at the State Department, had spied for the Soviets. And, promisingly, Nixon was the front-runner. "It seems to me that we
ought to have a real chance of winning this year," Buckley wrote to Goldwater around the time of the Republican National
Convention. He served the campaign as an adviser, and by aiding his friend Frank Shakespeare, who had taken charge
of Nixon's media operations.
But Buckley's candidate had a reputation for shiftiness that made him unpopular across the political spectrum. Some of
the editors of National Review, recalling that Nixon had cut a deal with Rockefeller in order to secure the G.O.P.
nomination in 1960, didn't sufficiently trust him. And the Birch Society had nothing but contempt for the figure whom
Welch had called one of "the slipperiest politicians that ever showed up on the American scene." As President, in 1969,
Nixon began to open diplomatic relations with Communist China, and the right wing placed him on its list of perfidious
appeasers. When he visited Beijing in 1972, even Buckley was deeply offended. But when the general election took place
later that year, with the antiwar Democratic candidate, George McGovern, voicing the country's anxieties over Vietnam,

Buckley and the mainstream of what he called "responsible conservatism" returned to Nixon. The purist conservatives
were left to back the third-party candidacy of John Schmitz, a Republican congressman and a member of the John Birch
Society.
Nixon won in a landslide, and the next year he appointed Buckley the American delegate to the United Nations. The
conservative pragmatists had found the way to real power. And, despite the embarrassment of Watergate, in Nixon's
second term, their strategy proved effective over time. Nixon's campaign against McGovern sharpened the Democrats'
internal divisions over civil rights and Vietnam, and, Buckley wrote, revealed that the Democrats had "an indifference
toward national independence and a hostility toward national freedom." Meanwhile, the Buckley mainstream, having read
the Birchers out of the conservative movement, established itself as a permanent and growing force in the Republican
Party and in national politics.
In 1976, Buckley and National Review supported Ronald Reagan's primary challenge to Nixon's successor, Gerald Ford.
After two terms as governor, Reagan had matured into what Buckley considered a nearly ideal conservative politician: a
shrewd leader as well as a man of principle. Reagan nearly succeeded in wresting the nomination from Ford,
demonstrating how formidable a national figure he had become. The Bircher right had flourished in his political bastion of
Orange County, and Reagan was adept at winning extremists' allegiance while he pursued realistic strategies. His
pragmatic side showed immediately after he finally secured the Republican nomination in 1980, when he chose the
relatively moderate George H. W. Bush, his bitter foe during the primaries, as his running mate. Though the decision
dismayed right-wing ideologues, it had two practical benefits: it instantly healed the divisions between Republican
moderates and conservatives, and it helped dampen charges from the Democrats that Reagan was a reckless right-
winger. Nobody was more pleased by Bush's selection than his fellow Skull and Bones man William F. Buckley, who
understood the political logic as clearly as Reagan had.
As President, Reagan flattered the extremists—he even delivered some admiring words about Skousen's Freemen
Institute—but he saved his political capital for his real goals: undoing the fiscal underpinnings of New Deal-style
government, and redirecting U.S. foreign policy by battling the Soviet Union and its proxies around the world. He
appointed moderates to positions of importance, as when he made James Baker III, Bush's close associate, his first chief
of staff, rather than the far more ideological Edwin Meese III, his former chief of staff from California. (As a top policy
adviser, Meese helped Reagan stack the federal bench with conservatives, but he was otherwise eclipsed by Baker and
Baker's deputy, the pragmatic Reaganite Michael Deaver, and his crusade, as Attorney General, to roll back civil-rights
legislation largely failed.) When zealots in the Administration were exposed, as in the Iran-Contra scandal, Reagan
skillfully evaded responsibility and replaced them with more centrist Republicans. And, when he recognized in Mikhail
Gorbachev a Soviet leader with whom he could undertake genuine efforts to reduce the nuclear threat, Reagan pushed
forward, ignoring the complaints that he had become, in the hard-liner Howard Phillips's phrase, "a useful idiot for Soviet
propaganda."
Whatever misgivings may have arisen about him on the right, Reagan achieved a dramatic conservative overhaul of the
federal tax code, a profound reconfiguring of the judiciary, and a near-victory for the West in the Cold War. From the
standpoint of the mainstream right, the only problem with his legacy was that no other Republican could come close to
matching his public appeal and political savvy. For the party of Reagan, his departure was the beginning of a long decline,
and it is the absence of a similarly totemic figure, during the past twenty years, that has allowed the current resurgence of
extremism. George H. W. Bush repelled right-wingers with his moderate tendencies—not least when, in the face of fiscal
calamity, he broke his campaign pledge not to raise taxes. Bill Clinton inspired them to an almost ecstatic series of
attacks, and though there remained enough of an older conservative establishment, personified by Senator Bob Dole, to
check some of the wildest charges, the new Republican House majority after 1994, pushed by such ideologues as Tom
DeLay and Dick Armey, had little interest in maintaining the center. They harassed Clinton, forcing an impeachment even
though polls showed that more than sixty per cent of the American people disapproved. George W. Bush seemed at first
to have a bit of Reagan's conservative charisma, but the right wing turned against him for failing to win the war in Iraq, for
his moderate position on immigration, and for spending hundreds of millions of federal dollars to combat the financial
collapse in 2008. When William F. Buckley died, during the 2008 primary season, it seemed to symbolize the end of a
conservative era. David Klinghoffer, a former literary editor at National Review, lamented that "urbane visionaries and
builders of institutions" such as Buckley have been replaced by media figures "who make their money by stirring fears and
resentments." Conservatism, Klinghoffer added, "has undergone a shift toward demagoguery and hucksterism," and is
now ruled by those he called "the crazy-cons."
Some Republicans have tried to extend the Buckley tradition, but to little effect. The commentator David Frum, a former
speechwriter for George W. Bush, lost his job at the American Enterprise Institute after he complained about the
Republicans' obstruction of health-care reform and called the right-wing surge a threat to conservatism. In June, the
congressman Bob Inglis, of South Carolina, a tough conservative who nonetheless backed Bush's financial bailout, lost a
vicious primary fight with a right-wing insurgent named Trey Gowdy. To his amazement, Inglis was confronted on the
campaign trail by voters who were convinced that numbers on their Social Security cards indicated that a secret bank had
bought them at birth. "And then, of course," he recalls, "it turned into something about the Federal Reserve and the
Bilderbergers and all that stuff." Not even Karl Rove can afford open dissent with the Tea Partiers. Appearing on Fox
News the night of the recent primaries, he described the Tea Party-backed Senate candidate in Delaware, Christine
O'Donnell, as probably unelectable and said that some of her statements were "nutty." Instantly, criticism came from
Sarah Palin, Rush Limbaugh, and other right-wing Republicans. Within days, he was back on Fox, proclaiming himself "a
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772691 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772691 Date: 08/31/2015
huge Tea Party fan," endorsing O'Donnell, and affirming that the National Republican Senatorial Committee would give
her its full backing.
So far, Rove, an unlikely dissident, is the only prominent Republican leader to so much as gesture at stepping forward, as
Buckley and his allies did. Even strong conservatives like Inglis have been pushed aside, as have such former G.O.P.
stalwarts as Charlie Crist, in Florida, and Mike Castle, in Delaware, both beaten in the primaries by Tea Party candidates;
Grist is now running a long-shot campaign as an Independent. Desperate for gains in the midterm elections, the
Republicans are neglecting the struggle it took to make politics safe for Reagan.
Fifty years ago, President Kennedy deplored the far right's "counsels of fear and suspicion." Today, Obama's White
House is still struggling to make sense of its enemies. In the absence of forthright leadership, on both the right and the
left, the job of standing up to extremists appears to have been left to the electorate. Candidates like O'Donnell may prove
too eccentric to prevail, or voters may simply become disillusioned by politicians who campaign on their hatred of
government. After the election, mainstream conservatives may well engage in what Richard Viguerie has forecast as "a
massive, almost historic battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party." (Already, Rove and some leading Bush
political operatives, including the former Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie, have been quietly
supplanting the battered G.O.P. establishment in the effort to raise funds for this year's candidates.) But, according to a
recent poll, more than seventy per cent of Republicans support the Tea Party, and it seems almost certain that a
Republican Party that has unstintingly appeased the far right will enjoy a strong and perhaps smashing victory in the
coming midterm elections.
In 1906, early in the Progressive era, the humorist Finley Peter Dunne's fictional barroom sage, Mr. Dooley, put the social
and political tumult of the day into perspective. "Th' noise ye hear is not th' first gun iv a revolution," Dooley remarked. "It's
on'y th' people iv th' United States batin' a carpet." A century from now, or even a year from now, Americans may say the
same about the Tea Party. For the moment, though, it appears that the extreme right wing is on the verge of securing a
degree of power over Congress and the Republican Party that is unprecedented in modern American history. For
defenders of national cohesion and tempered adversity in our politics, it is an alarming state of affairs. •

Bringing Up Boehner <http://www.huffingtonpost.com/drew-westen/post 1034 b 755497.html>
According to news reports, today Republican minority leader and Coppertone model
John Boehner will give his "closing argument" to the American people on why they
should throw out the Democrats and kill the Obama-Pelosi-Reid "job-killing
agenda." He will be returning to his working class roots, speaking at a piping
manufacturing plant, an unusual venue these days for a man who is seen much more
frequently at gatherings of Wall Street executives with open checkbooks and the
males-only country club where he works on his tan when not making the rounds at
other clubs with industry lobbyists.
Either the Speaker-to-be is following the model of Michael Steele and
free-lancing, or Karl Rove and the Republicans believe it is safe or even
advantageous to bring him out in public after the White House made an effort to
put Boehner's face on what a Republican majority might look like, with the
president invoking his name eight times in one speech.
I have to admit that at the time I was agnostic as to whether it made sense to
try to brand him at this late date, as Boehner has minimal name recognition
among voters. But the White House was no doubt responding to three realities.
First, Boehner is an unknown to most Americans, which means that, unlike most
Republicans in the news, he has not been well branded by the GOP -- which means
for once Democrats might actually brand someone or something first rather than
playing catch-up. Second, Boehner would indeed be the highest-ranking Republican
were the GOP to assume control over the House (other than of course Karl Rove,
who is now directing traffic on the right side of the street in Washington
again). And third, a concrete face is always better than an abstraction when
telling a story, and other than perhaps Sarah Palin, who Republicans could
alternately accept and decline as the leader of their party, Boehner's tanned
visage and history as errand-boy for virtually every major corporate special
interest in his two decades in Washington (including his stint as the Marlboro
Man, handing out tobacco lobby campaign checks to his fellow Republicans on the
floor of the House) made him a potential counter-villain to the Republican's
bogeywoman, Nancy Pelosi.
I remained agnostic until this week, when colleagues at Media Matters Action
Network and I conducted a national messaging survey
<http://cloudfront.mediamattersaction.org/static/images/pdf/BrandingBoehner.pdf>
with 1,000 registered voters, selected to match the demographics of the voting
and likely voting populations. The goal was to see how effectively we could
speak with voters about Boehner as not only the symbol and standard-bearer for
the GOP but also the water-boy for corporate America. (The results were
surprisingly similar whether we looked at registered voters or likely voters,
although as others have described, precisely how to determine who is a "likely
voter" in this election is as much art as science, and the point of good
messaging at this point is actually to change the dynamics of likely voting, not
just to reflect them.)
As detailed in a memo published in Politico, what we found was clear: Boehner is
a target well worth defining, who readily stands for precisely what Americans
perceive to be the reasons they would have to hold their noses to vote for
Congressional Republicans (perhaps the only group left who poll worse than
Congressional Democrats with swing voters). We tested both paragraph-length
narratives and single-sentence language designed to capture the essence of those
narratives, and in each case, we tested them against the toughest opposition
language we could test them against: the words of Boehner, Cantor, Limbaugh and
others combined in defining the "Obama-Pelosi-Reid" agenda.
What we found, in brief, is that we could beat a tough GOP narrative about the

actor going in one of the narratives to Karl Rove and his corporate allies), and
we could win with over 15 different sentence-long descriptions of "what's the
matter with Boehner" with margins ranging from 10 to 60 points against a tough
conservative attack on the Obama-Pelosi-Reid axis of conservative evil.
The narratives that most moved likely voters -- including swing voters, who
preferred them by double-digits over tough Republican rhetoric -- made clear
whose voices Boehner would be speaking for as Speaker (e.g., the Wall Street
executives he convened to try to block Wall Street reform). They harnessed the
same populist anger at the hijacking of Washington by corporate special
interests that has enlivened the tea partiers and is palpable across the
political spectrum, and they focused on the extremism of the party Boehner would
Speak for. A narrative that brought Karl Rove into the picture was slightly more
polarizing with swing voters but slightly more powerful with likely Democratic
voters.
In some ways what was most surprising was the success of the single-line
statements of what we need in a Speaker and who John Boehner really speaks for
(although these single-line statements came after the narratives, and likely
reflect the power of branding, even over the course of a brief online encounter
with voters). They ranged from relatively lofty and aspirational (e.g., "We need
a Speaker who is also a listener, who can hear the voices of ordinary Americans"
-- a theme colleagues and I found highly resonant across the political spectrum
in message testing on the role of money in politics) -- to the harder-edged
(e.g., "The Speaker of the House is a heartbeat away from the Presidency.
Unfortunately, we know where John Boehner's heart is, and it isn't with the
middle class," or "John Boehner understands deficits. He's spent nearly 20 years
in Washington creating them.")
If there's a message in this message research, it is at once short-term and
long-term. In the short run, if Democrats want to hang onto their seats in
November, they would do well to define this election in terms of the middle
class and small business versus the billionaires and big corporations that are
hijacking our democracy; to use Boehner as a poster child for the party whose
primary commitment is to the latter and whose tan is a testament to that
commitment; and to avoid giving voters reason to regret their vote if they give
it to Democrats again this time, by supporting the things they say they stand
for and avoiding that golden mean between the public interest and the special
interests that finance campaigns on both sides of the aisle.
In the longer run, branding matters. One of the biggest strategic and messaging
mistakes of the last two years was the failure of Democrats to brand their
opponents while their opponents were busy branding them -- and in particular the
failure to brand the Bush Recession as the natural consequence of failed
Republican economic principles. Two years ago, that was a virtually uncontested
political proposition, as the voters made clear in handing Democrats the White
House and supermajorities in both the House and Senate. Today, the public is
split down the middle as to who caused the recession.
Reality doesn't brand itself. Hopefully it won't take a. debacle in November and
another 10 million jobs lost for reality to unveil itself again for a brief
political moment and for progressives to have a second bite at the apple.

Why Obama Is Losing the Political War
By Mark Halperin
Barack Obama is being politically crushed in a vise. From above, by elite opinion about his competence. From below, by
mass anger and anxiety over unemployment. And it is too late for him to do anything about this predicament until after
November's elections.
With the exception of core Obama Administration loyalists, most politically engaged elites have reached the same
conclusions: the White House is in over its head, isolated, insular, arrogant and clueless about how to get along with or
persuade members of Congress, the media, the business community or working-class voters. This view is held by Fox
News pundits, executives and anchors at the major old-media outlets, reporters who cover the White House, Democratic
and Republican congressional leaders and governors, many Democratic business people and lawyers who raised big
money for Obama in 2008, and even some members of the Administration just beyond the inner circle. (See Obama's
troubled first year, issue by issue.)
On Friday, after the release of the latest bleak unemployment data — the last major jobs figures before the midterms —
Obama said, "Putting the American people back to work, expanding opportunity, rebuilding the economic security of the
middle class is the moral and national challenge of our time." But elites feel the President has failed to meet that challenge
and are convinced he will be unable to do so in the remainder of his term. Moreover, there is a growing perception that
Obama's decisions are causing harm — that businesses are being hurt by the Administration's legislation and that
economic recovery is stalling because of the uncertainty surrounding energy policy, health care, deficits, housing,
immigration and spending.
And that sentiment is spreading. Many members of the general public appear deeply skeptical of Obama's capacity to turn
things around, especially, but not exclusively, those inclined to dislike him — Tea Partyers and John McCain voters, but
also tens of millions of middle-class Americans, including quite a few who turned out for Obama in 2008. (See how some
Americans are facing the prospect of long-term unemployment.)
The misery afflicting the country has no political affiliation. Listen to the voices from this striking TV ad for Rob Portman,
the Republican former Congressman and Bush budget director who is running for Senate from Ohio. One woman at a
Dayton career fair says starkly, "There are no jobs." A man announces plaintively and with obvious frustration, "I've been
looking for a job now for 13 months." Events like this job fair are becoming the grim iconic gatherings of our time, the
breadlines for the Obama years.
Most of Obama's private (and sometimes public) rebuttals to the voices slamming him on all sides are justified or spot on.
He did inherit a lot of problems from the Bush Administration. He did act quickly in the initial weeks of his Administration to
stave off a worldwide depression. His efforts at job creation have been obstructed by Republicans (even the proposals
based on policies supported by the GOP in the past). His opponents haven't put forth specifics of their own, nor offered
genuine compromise, while the media have allowed the right's activists and gabbers to run wild with criticism without
furnishing legitimate alternative solutions. (See Barack Obama's top 10 sound bites.)
But Obama has exacerbated his political problems not just by failing to enact policies that would have actually turned the
economy around, but also by authorizing a series of tactical moves intended to demonize Republicans and distract from
the problems at hand. He has wasted time lambasting his foes when he should have been putting forth his agenda in a
clear, optimistic fashion, defending the benefits of his key decisions during the past two years (health care and the
Troubled Asset Relief Program, for example) and explaining what he would do with a re-elected Democratic majority to
spur growth.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772693 Date: 08/31/2015
Throughout the year, we have been treated to Obama-led attacks on George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, Rush Limbaugh,
Congressman Joe Barton (for his odd apology to BP), John Boehner (for seeking the speakership — or was it something
about an ant?) and Fox News (for everything). Suitable Democratic targets in some cases, perhaps, but not worth the time
of a busy Commander in Chief. In the past few days, we have witnessed the spectacle of the President himself and his
top advisers wading into allegations that Republicans are attempting to buy the election using foreign money laundered
through the Chamber of Commerce, combining with Karl Rove and his wealthy backers to fund a flood of negative
television commercials. Not only is this issue convoluted and far-fetched, but it also distracts from the issues voters care
about, frustrating political insiders and alienating struggling citizens (not that many are following such an offbeat story
line). Feinting and gibing can't obscure those job numbers. (See the best viral campaign ads of 2010.)
The President and Democrats have passed many significant measures (the stimulus spending, the auto-company rescue,
the health care law and the financial regulation effort) that someday may be seen as brave and bold, the foundation for a
better economy. Obama and his closest aides certainly think that will happen. But the President was correct when he said
Friday, "the only piece of economic news that folks still looking for work want to hear is, 'You're hired," and that's still not
occurring for too many Americans.
The politically good news for Obama is that no matter what the outcome of the midterm elections, everything changes in
January. Republicans will have a greater obligation, politically and morally, to help govern, rather than thwart and badger.
The President will get a chance, in his State of the Union address and in his budget proposal, to show he is turning the
page on the political horrors of 2010 for his party and the nation. But before then, Republicans are almost certainly going
to demonstrate that you can beat something with nothing, especially when Americans seem to think that the Obama
Administration hasn't much to offer either, except more of the same that isn't working.

Bringing Up Boehner <http://www.huffingtonpost.com/drew-westen/post 1034 b 755497.html>
According to news reports, today Republican minority leader and Coppertone model
John Boehner will give his "closing argument" to the American people on why they
should throw out the Democrats and kill the Obama-Pelosi-Reid "job-killing
agenda." He will be returning to his working class roots, speaking at a piping
manufacturing plant, an unusual venue these days for a man who is seen much more
frequently at gatherings of Wall Street executives with open checkbooks and the
males-only country club where he works on his tan when not making the rounds at
other clubs with industry lobbyists.
Either the Speaker-to-be is following the model of Michael Steele and
free-lancing, or Karl Rove and the Republicans believe it is safe or even
advantageous to bring him out in public after the White House made an effort to
put Boehner's face on what a Republican majority might look like, with the
president invoking his name eight times in one speech:
I have to admit that at the time I was agnostic as to whether it made sense to
try to brand him at this late date, as Boehner has minimal name recognition
among voters. But the White House was no doubt responding to three realities.
First, Boehner is an unknown to most Americans, which means that, unlike most
Republicans in the news, he has not been well branded by the GOP -- which means
for once Democrats might actually brand someone or something first rather than
playing catch-up. Second, Boehner would indeed be the highest-ranking Republican
were the GOP to assume control over the House (other than of course Karl Rove,
who is now directing traffic on the right side of the street in Washington
again). And third, a concrete face is always better than an abstraction when
telling a story, and other than perhaps Sarah Palin, who Republicans could
alternately accept and decline as the leader of their party, Boehner's tanned
visage and history as errand-boy for virtually every major corporate special
interest in his two decades in Washington (including his stint as the Marlboro
Man, handing out tobacco lobby campaign checks to his fellow Republicans on the
floor of the House) made him a potential counter-villain to the Republican's
bogeywoman, Nancy Pelosi.
I remained agnostic until this week, when colleagues at Media Matters Action
Network and I conducted a national messaging survey
<http://cloudfront.mediamattersaction.org/static/images/pdf/BrandingBoehner.pdf>
with 1,000 registered voters, selected to match the demographics of the voting
and likely voting populations. The goal was to see how effectively we could
speak with voters about Boehner as not only the symbol and standard-bearer for
the GOP but also the water-boy for corporate America. (The results were
surprisingly similar whether we looked at registered voters or likely voters,
although as others have described, precisely how to determine who is a "likely
voter" in this election is as much art as science, and the point of good
messaging at this point is actually to change the dynamics of likely voting, not
just to reflect them.)
As detailed in a memo published in Politico, what we found was clear: Boehner is
a target well worth defining, who readily stands for precisely what Americans
perceive to be the reasons they would have to hold their noses to vote for
Congressional Republicans (perhaps the only group left who poll worse than
Congressional Democrats with swing voters). We tested both paragraph-length
narratives and single-sentence language designed to capture the essence of those
narratives, and in each case, we tested them against the toughest opposition
language we could test them against: the words of Boehner, Cantor, Limbaugh and
others combined in defining the "Obama-Pelosi-Reid" agenda.
What we found, in brief, is that we could beat a tough GOP narrative about the

Goodbye, Mr. Jones
And good riddance. Why Jim Jones was the worst national
security advisor in decades.
BY DAVID J. ROTHKOPF I OCTOBER 8, 2010
The president's inexperience did in Jones more than any of the general's deficits. He didn't know what he wanted. He
vacillated on key issues. He simply demonstrated the problems America repeatedly has when it hires men with no foreign-
policy background to take on the most important international job in the world. Further, he did not really know enough
about how the presidency works to nip in the bud the creation of the inner-circle bubble that effectively negated much of
the work that the formal policy process did. Obama encouraged (or tolerated for long-enough that it looks like
encouragement) his campaign foreign-policy deputies to continue to report directly to him, and this led to some public and
private backdooring of Jones that undercut his authority dramatically. He did not empower Jones, and that combined with
Jones's own shortcomings led to the zero-chemistry, ineffective collaboration that has been openly criticized by senior
White House and foreign policy officials since the spring of Obama's first year in office.
In fact the situation got so bad that Jones was publicly undercut by true Obama confidante Denis McDonough more than
once. It is something of a surprise he lasted this long. As one former national security advisor said to me while we were
discussing a well-known instance of McDonough publicly undercutting Jones, "That would have only happened once on
my watch. It would have been me or him."

The Power Of Clinton, The Invisibility Of
Obama
First Posted: 10-12-10 02:37 PM I Updated: 10-12-10 02:37 PM
LOUISVILLE -- I see that Dr. Rand Paul has taken out after Bill Clinton, dredging up Monica Lewinsky. And I know why
Paul did so. The former president was here in Kentucky yesterday and in this state, as in many others, he is a far more
potent and popular foe than President Barack Obama.
On my first day working for The Huffington Post, I came back to Kentucky, where I began my career many years ago at
the Courier-Journal. The people who run the University of Louisville Kentucky Author Forum wanted me to do an on-stage
interview with a certain best-selling author who is also my new boss: Arianna Huffington. It was a tricky mix of professional
incest and personal nostalgia, but the event worked out well and I also got a chance to play Kentucky reporter once again
out in the state.
I raced over to Lexington and here is the ground-level, outside-the-Beltway reality I witnessed:
Like Voldemort's, Obama's is a name no one dares utter -- and that includes Clinton speaking to Democrats.
At a sunny, noontime rally on the campus of the University of Kentucky in Lexington yesterday, the former president made
a stirring, well-argued case for Democratic Senate candidate Jack Conway and for Democrats generally -- without once
mentioning Obama and rarely mentioning the presidency. It was as though we suddenly had only two branches of
government.
To be fair, almost no one else at the one-hour rally mentioned the sitting president. And Kentucky is staunch Republican
territory. "We're farther ahead in the generic ballot here than ever," GOP Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky told me
yesterday. "President Obama was never popular here, even at his peak."
Still, the eerie invisibility of the president is a telling commentary on the Democrats' confused, divided and defensive
predicament as they brace for the verdict of the voters on Election Day, Nov. 2. There was something odd -- and, if you're
a Democrat, depressing -- about a former Democratic president avoiding any mention of his Democratic successor.
Clinton sincerely wants to help out on the trail -- and certainly wants to avoid the accusation that he didn't try to help. But
his travels have turned into a personal victory lap that often makes him -- not the candidate he's touting -- the center of
attention. That was true here in Kentucky. The rally's mechanics were mostly handled by the Secret Service; more to the
point, the final (and therefore top-billed) speaker wasn't Conway. It was Clinton. The Conway people didn't mind. They
were glad to have him.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772705 Date: 08/31/2015
Rail-thin but not frail, wearing a tweedy professorial sports coat and his signature rueful, knowing smile, Clinton was
treated with a respect bordering on awe. His familiar mane of white hair, thinning now, was translucent in the sun, giving
him an almost otherworldly look: the Sage from a Better Age.
Clinton is beloved In Kentucky. He won the state twice. He speaks the local dialect, which contains Appalachian notes of
working-class pride, suspicion of big shots and Baptist revivalism. But more than that -- and more than just in Kentucky --
Clinton's economic record (22.7 million jobs created, and he tends not to forget to mention the .7) looks spectacularly
good in the context of what has followed.
These days there is almost an Old Testament, milk-and-honey reverence for that economic record, at least as expressed
by former Kentucky Sen. Wendell Ford. An old-school podium pounder, Ford -- stooped but still strong voiced at 86 --
talked of the former president in messianic terms. "Bill Clinton found us the path to gold!" he shouted. The crowd of 2,000,
most of them students, didn't laugh. They seemed to think he was right.
How any of this helps Obama is far from clear; it isn't even clear that it helps many Democrats -- since they'd be joining
the same Washington party that the current president ostensibly heads.
But Clinton is all too happy to show Obama how it's done. As a campaigner and as president, Clinton's gift was his ability
to untangle the knots of even the most complex policy issue and explain it in plain language to people suspicious of the
powerful -- but eager not to be screwed by them or to be seen as dupes. Republicans and their corporate allies were out
to shut down the few good things that government does for you, he said, in the name of balancing a budget that they
themselves destroyed. "I gave you budget surpluses!" Clinton said, as if this had been an act of personal beneficence.
Knowing his audience, the former president focused on Pell Grants, and on a new program that allows graduates to pay
back their loans over longer periods and at lower rates. Paul, he said, will try to take that new program away -- and, given
the GOP's deliberate vagueness about spending cuts -- there is reason to think Clinton is right.
Which is why Paul got personal today. Which means Clinton drew blood. Which means that he did what he came to do.
Which means Obama will remain invisible, at least in Kentucky, at least for now, and probably for a long time to come.

Declan,
Thanks for your email. Of course it's not personal. But I do think it's
wrong.
When we were in Government we believed we could only succeed if we treated
Northern Ireland as a bi-partisan issue and I encouraged other Governments
to adopt the same approach. That meant when President Bush was in the White
House, I went out of my way always to see and brief Democrats - in Congress
and in the Senate - whenever I came to the States. It also meant when we
held the first economic conference led by Mayor Bloomberg in Belfast, the
dinner we gave at Hillsborough was not restricted to just those in
respective Governments.
In respect of how we handled the issue within the UK, that didn't mean I
invited the Shadow Secretary of State to share every platform, but the
Shadow was not excluded from being at major events. Indeed we made a point
of not only saying we were bi-partisan, but acted accordingly.
Having brokered the Hillsborough Agreement and having discussed with your
Secretary of State - at all stages - how the US could help through an

Declan,
Thanks for your email. Of course it's not personal. But I do think it's
wrong.
When we were in Government we believed we could only succeed if we treated
Northern Ireland as a bi-partisan issue and I encouraged other Governments
to adopt the same approach. That meant when President Bush was in the White
House, I went out of my way always to see and brief Democrats - in Congress
and in the Senate - whenever I came to the States. It also meant when we
held the first economic conference led by Mayor Bloomberg in Belfast, the
dinner we gave at Hillsborough was not restricted to just those in
respective Governments.
In respect of how we handled the issue within the UK, that didn't mean I
invited the Shadow Secretary of State to share every platform, but the
Shadow was not excluded from being at major events. Indeed we made a point
of not only saying we were bi-partisan, but acted accordingly.
Having brokered the Hillsborough Agreement and having discussed with your
Secretary of State - at all stages - how the US could help through an
Economic Conference, I am obviously somewhat disappointed not to have been
invited to attend the Conference in any capacity.
That of course should never be confused with my deep respect and admiration
for Secretary Clinton. Frankly without her help during her time in the White

However, I don't have to rehearse with you that successful long-term
economic investment in Northern Ireland will require building not only a
stable peace process, but continuing to build cross-party and
cross-community consensus. I am sorry we have not been invited to help.
The current coalition Government in Britain will not always be in power and
it may not even last the course. It seems regrettable that in such a
challenging global economic environment that those of us who helped build
the peace are not even invited to continue helping.

Catty Carla Bruni lifts lid on Michelle Obama's
'hellish' job
By Peter Allen and Michael Seamark
Last updated at 1:26 AM on 16th September 2010
Michelle Obama thinks being America's First Lady is 'hell', Carla Bruni reveals today in a wildly indiscreet new book.
Miss Bruni reveals that Mrs Obama replied when asked about her position as the U.S. president's wife: 'Don't ask! It's
hell. I can't stand it!'
Details of the private conversation, which took place at the White House during an official visit by Nicolas Sarkozy last
March, emer ed in Carla And The Ambitious, a book written in collaboration with Miss Bruni.
No secrets: Michelle Obama, left, and Carla Bruni last year. Bruni made the revelations about the U.S. First Lady's
feelings in a wildly indiscreet new book
In it, she says one term as French president `will be enough' for her husband and suggests he might take tips from his
friend Tony Blair: Why not start making money?'

According to a friend quoted in the book, the Sarkozys have been 'impressed and inspired' by Mr Blair's fortune built up
since he left Downing Street.
Miss Bruni also takes a thinly veiled swipe at Princess Diana when talking about a visit to an African hospital full of Aids
victims earlier this year.
She says she refused requests by French cameramen for a photograph of her carrying a baby in her arms 'like Lady Di',
adding: 'There's something obscene in promoting yourself when you are giving of yourself.'

In the book, the Italian model 42, accuses French government officials of trying to 'kill' her husband with too much work,
and claims Mr Sarkozy lets himself be 'bullied' into complying.
Comparing herself to other leaders' wives, Miss Bruni says: 'I'm so different. I was a model. I sing, and I want to continue
to sing. And on top of that you expect me to be subtle?' And she admits: 'I am a femme fatale, my dear.'
She also recounts a telephone row with Mr Sarkozy's ex-wife Cecilia, who warned her that Mr Sarkozy had 'not yet turned
a new page' after their marriage.
Miss Bruni replied: 'Not only has he turned a page but he's changed books altogether. And you are the only person on
earth not to have noticed it.'

Days of rage: the Tea Party & America's right
Blumenthal begin of the skype highlighting end of the skype highlighting, 17 September 2010
About the author
Max Blumenthal begin_of_the_skype_highlighting end_of_the_skype_highlighting is a journalist whose work is
published in the New York Times, the Daily Beast, the Nation, the Huffington Post, Salon, and other publications. He is
author of Republican Gomorrah: Inside the Movement that Shattered the Party (Basic/Nation Books, 2009). His website is

The rise of the Tea Party movement in the United States in the first twenty months of Barack Obama '5 presidency is
shaking the political establishment, a trend reinforced by the victories of its candidates in Republican Party primaries. But
where has the movement come from, and what is its inner life? Max Blumenthal
begin_of the_skype highlighting end of the_skype highlighting, author of "Republican Gomorrah", enters the heady
world of the Tea Party to unravel the mix of driven personalities, feverish rhetoric, toxic hatreds, and flirtation with violence
that fuel its sub-culture's insurgent activism.
"He will tell you that he wants a strong authority to take from him the crushing responsibility of thinking for himself. Since
the Republic is weak, he is led to break the law out of love for obedience. But is it really strong authority that he wishes?
In reality he demands rigorous order for others, and for himself disorder without responsibility" - Jean-Paul Sartre, Anti-
Semite and Jew
I am not sure when I first detected the noxious fumes that would envelop the conservative movement in the Barack
Obama era. It might have been in April 2009, when I visited a series of gun shows in rural California and Nevada.
Perusing tables piled high with high-calibre semi-automatic weapons and chatting with anyone in my vicinity, I heard
urgent warnings of mass roundups, concentration-camps, and a socialist government in Washington. "These people that
are purchasing these guns are people that are worried about what's going on in this country", a gun dealer told me outside
a show in Reno. "Good luck Obama", a young gun enthusiast remarked to me. "We outnumber him 100 to 1." At this time,
the Tea Party movement had not even registered on the national media's radar.
In September 2009, I led a panel discussion at the University of California-Riverside about my book Republic Gomorrah
(Basic/Nation Books, 2009). Inside an auditorium filled with nearly 100 students and faculty, I sat alongside Jonathan
Walton, an African-American professor of religious studies and prolific writer, and Mark Takano, an erudite, openly gay

former Democratic congressional candidate and local community-college trustee. In the middle of our discussion, a dozen
college Republicans stormed the front of the stage with signs denouncing me as a "left-wing hack" while a hysterical
young man leaped from the crowd, blowing kisses mockingly at Takano while heckling Walton as a "racist". Afterward,
university police-officers insisted on escorting me to my ride after the right-wing heckler attempted to follow me as he
shouted threats.
Who was this stalker? Just a concerned citizen worried about taxes? His name was Ryan Sorba and he was an operative
of a heavily funded national conservative youth outfit, the Intercollegiate Studies Institute. Besides founding dozens of
Republican youth groups across the country, Sorba has devoted an exceptional amount of energy to his interest in
homosexuals. His intellectual output consists of a tract titled The Born Gay Hoax, arguing that homosexuality is at once a
curable disease and a bogus trend manufactured by academic leftists. Adding to his credentials, Sorba has a history of
run-ins with the law, he explained when I called him about the order.
My encounter with this aggressive right-wing cadre seemed a strange, isolated event. But the hostility turned out to be
symptomatic of the intensifying campaign to delegitimise President Obama and his allies in Congress. The right's days of
rage were only beginning.
The constellation
Through his first year in office, Obama seemed oblivious to the threat of the far right. He campaigned against
partisanship, declaring that there were "no red states" and no "conservative America". Apparently, he thought it was
merely a contrivance or myth that there were people who rejected science, demonised gays, assailed minority and
women's rights - not that they genuinely believed in what they said. Speaking of changing Washington, Obama seemed to
think that the entire history of politics since the rise of Ronald Reagan and the right and their strategies of polarisation was
not deeply rooted but a superficial problem attributable to certain "divisive" personalities, easily wiped away with gestures
toward bipartisanship. His view of the parties was that they were simply mirror images sharing fundamental beliefs but
separated by "partisans". The skilled and devoted community organiser could bring them together.
Many of his supporters in the media, often partisans of political wars over the years, reinforced and amplified his
innocence, proclaiming he was the one at last who could "bridge the partisan divide". Andrew Sullivan, a disaffected
conservative who once called critics of George W Bush policies "fifth columnists" but now fervently supported Obama,
wrote that the new president was destined to become "a liberal Reagan who can reunite America". This optimism
pervaded the White House as the new president and his aides sought out Republicans willing to vote for his programmes.
After all, why couldn't we all just get along?
In his autobiographical book The Audacity of Hope, Obama highlighted a key component of his political strategy: "I serve
as a blank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views." Once he was elected,
conservatives concluded that they could reverse Obama's strength by transforming him into a human tableau for the most
fearsome images they could conjure (see "Barack Obama, the fallen messiah", 23 December 2009).
Obama's multiracial background was crucial in cultivating resentment among the shock-troops. Those who rejected
Obama's legitimacy to serve as president on the basis of his background gave birth to the "Birther" movement that sought
to challenge his citizenship. The movement's most visible figure, and therefore the most eccentric, was Orly Taitz, a
dentist and self-trained lawyer who had immigrated from the former Soviet republican of Moldova to Israel before settling
in the conservative bastion of Orange County, California. Convinced by claims on the far-right website WorldNetDaily that
Obama planned to create a "civilian national security force", Taitz told me she "realised that Obama was another Stalin -
it's a cross between Stalinist USSR and Hitler's Germany."
After becoming transfixed by online conspiracy theories claiming Obama's family had forged his birth-certificate in Hawaii,
Taitz snapped into action. She filed a lawsuit in November 2008 with California's secretary of state Debra Bowen
demanding an investigation into Obama's eligibility to serve as president. Taitz's plaintiff in the case was Wiley Drake, an
Orange County radio-preacher and former second vice-president of the Southern Baptist Convention who once publicly
prayed for Obama's death. While her lawsuit went nowhere, and subsequent suits earned her angry rebukes from judges,
Taitz became an instant media sensation, delivering heavily accented screeds against Obama before friendly interviewers
from Sean Hannity to CNN's Lou Dobbs (the latter, described by Taitz as her "greatest supporter", was eventually fired as
an indirect result of his hosting of her).
In March 2009, the Texas Representative Randy Neugebauer signed on to a Birther bill proposing that future presidential
candidates must prove their citizenship before becoming eligible to campaign. The Birther movement had found its voice
in government and made an indelible impact on the Republican grassroots. By June 2009, 28% of Republican
respondents to a Kos/Research 2000 poll said they thought Obama wasn't born in the United States, while 30% "weren't
sure". "Obama should be in the Big House", Taitz shrieked to me, "not the White House!"

When Obama announced healthcare reform as the first major initiative of his administration, the conservative movement
activated a campaign of demonisation - transformational politics - designed to turn Obama into the "Other", making him
seem as unfamiliar, and therefore as threatening, as possible. When the president urged the Congress to deliver a
healthcare-reform bill in 2009, the right staged a living theatre of political hatred which turned Obama's dream of
bipartisanship into a nightmarish version of Peter Weiss's MaraVSade. On 12 September 2009, tens of thousands of far-
right activists belonging to a loose confederation of anti-government groups called the Tea Party Patriots converged on
Washington's National Mall for a giant protest against the Obama healthcare plan. The date was significant: Fox News's
top-ranked talk-show host Glenn Beck had declared the birth of the "9-12 Project" to restore the sense of unity (and siege
mentality) that Americans experienced on 11 September 2001. But this time, Obama - not Osama - was the enemy.
While covering the rally, I witnessed sign after sign declaring Obama a greater danger to America's security than al-Qaida;
demonstrators held images that juxtaposed Obama's face with images of evildoers from Hitler to Pol Pot to Bin Laden;
others carried signs questioning Obama's status as a United States citizen. "We can fight al-Qaida, we can't kill Obama",
said an aging demonstrator. Another told me, "Obama is the biggest Nazi in the world", pointing to placards he had
fashioned depicting Obama and House of Representatives' majority leader Nancy Pelosi in SS outfits. According to
another activist, Obama's agenda was similar to Hitler's: "Hitler took over the banking industry, did he not? And Hitler had
his own personal secret service police. [The community-organising group] Acorn is an extension of that."
The seemingly incongruous Tea Party propaganda recalled signs waved by right-wing Jewish settlers during rallies
against Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and his support of the peace process, portraying him as an SS officer and as
the French collaborator Marshall Petain. In 1995, amid this provocative atmosphere, a young right-wing Jewish zealot
assassinated Rabin. The Israeli tragedy was a cautionary example of targeted hatred leading to violence.
Members of the Tea Party "Patriots" did not seem to care that their rhetoric was irrational, or that comparing Obama to
Hitler and Stalin was contradictory and obviously hyperbolic. Their motives were entirely negative. By purging government
of the multicultural evil that had seized power through illicit means (several activists told me they believed Acorn helped
Obama steal the election), they were convinced that a mythical golden American yesteryear would return. They had no
interest in building anything new or even articulating an agenda, much less discussing the merits of policies. The Tea
Party's primary concern was cultural purification - freedom from, not freedom to. Against the dark image of the president
and his liberal allies, Tea Party activists defined themselves as the children of light. The racial subtext was always
transparent.
The Tea Party's strategy rested on a guerrilla campaign of chaos and sabotage designed not only to intimidate Democrats
but also to disorient independent voters who might have supported healthcare reform. The Tea Paters were convinced
this would be an easy feat, since they believed the majority of the country was on their side - that they represented the
"real America". At the 9-12 rally Matt Kibbe, one of the march organisers, told the crowd that ABC News was reporting
that 1 million to 1.5 million people were in attendance; ABC denied this, saying "ABCNews.com reported an approximate
figure of 60,000 to 70,000 protesters." Then one Dick Armey led the crowd in a chant of "Freedom works! Freedom
works!" Unknown to most of the Tea Paters, they were intoning the name of a corporate-funded Beltway advocacy-
group, not the battle-cry of Mel Gibson's version of William Wallace in Bra veheart.
Indeed, contrary to its image as a grassroots movement mobilised to stifle the machinations of Washington elites, the Tea
Party movement was the creation of a constellation of industry-funded conservative groups with close Republican ties.
The movement's leading puppet-master was the same Dick Armey, who directed resources and talking-points to the Tea
Party "Patriots" from his Washington-based advocacy group, FreedomWorks. Among the corporate clients of Armey's
lobbying firm, which he was forced to leave as a result of his involvement in the Tea Parties, was the pharmaceutical giant
Bristol Myers Squibb, a company with a clear interest in defeating healthcare reform. (Armey's other "real American"
clients included the Marxist terror-cult, the People's Mojahedin of Iran, which received funding and assistance from
Saddam Hussein in order to launch terrorist strikes throughout the 1990s against Iranian civilian targets.) Armey collected
a consulting fee of $250,000 directly from FreedomWorks and $300,000 from allied astroturf front groups. FreedomWorks
paid out much of its money to an assortment of Republican political consultants.
The rumour
If Dick Armey was the Tea Party king, Sarah Palin was eager to be crowned the Tea Party queen. Just days after
Obama's inauguration, Palin abruptly quit her job as Alaskan governor to vie for the honour. Palin's motives for quitting
became clear when she inked a lucrative deal to write her political memoir Going Rogue, signed on as a regular
contributor to Fox News, and received $1 million an episode for a reality-show on cable television, "Sarah Palin's Alaska".
Palin's book-tour, which sent her through Middle America in a luxuriously outfitted bus, resembled both a presidential
campaign and a travelling carnival.

Whether or not Palin intends to run for president, her growing media presence has magnified her influence within the
Republican Party. Yet the ever-expanding Palin phenomenon was greeted with hostility by Republican politicos
desperately seeking to expand the party's base after the drubbing in 2008. Steve Schmidt, formerly John McCain's
campaign manager in the doomed presidential campaign of 2008, warned that Palin's nomination in 2012 would be
"catastrophic" for the GOP. His doomsday prediction was backed by an Gallup poll in October 2009 revealing her as one
of the most polarising and unpopular political figures in the country with a disapproval rating of over 50%. Unfortunately for
Schmidt and other party pragmatists, those who approve of Palin represent the heartbeat of the Republican Party, its
most fervent activists, and cannot be dissuaded from following her, even if she is leading the party off a cliff.
A special congressional election in New York's heavily Republican 23rd district in November 2009 was the first major test
of Palin's power. Along with a parade of nationally recognised conservatives, Palin endorsed Doug Hoffman, an unknown
far-right third-party candidate closely allied with the Tea Party - in the process helping to force a popular moderate
Republican politician, Dede Scozzafava, from the race. In the end, Palin's ideological purge in upstate New York led to an
improbable Democratic victory, the first in that district in more than 100 years. After the disaster Palin and her allies
claimed victory, insisting they had at least hastened the purge of ideologically impure Republicans from the party. She
went on to endorse Rand Paul, the son of right-wing libertarian Representative Ron Paul and a candidate in Kentucky's
GOP senatorial primary; meanwhile George W Bush's vice-president Dick Cheney went out of his way to endorse Rand's
regular Republican opponent, Trey Grayson, the Kentucky secretary of state.
The self-described "hardcore pro-lifer" Palin followed the Tea Party script of avoiding social issues like abortion and gay
marriage in order to obscure the large presence of the Christian right within the movement's ranks, recasting herself
accordingly as a libertarian concerned primarily with issues of "economic freedom". She claimed the Democratic "cap-
and-trade" plan to limit carbon-emissions would harm the livelihood of blue-collar workers, and she assailed healthcare
reform as a Trojan horse for "socialism" (though she admitted her family "used to hustle over the border" to take
advantage of Canada's single-payer healthcare system). But no Palin attack had as much effect as the one she blasted
out on her Facebook page claiming the Obama healthcare plan included a provision for "death panels" that would
recommend euthanasia for severely ill patients like her Down syndrome-afflicted son, Trig. With the click of a button, Palin
transformed the tone of the healthcare debate from rancorous to poisonous.
The source of Palin's "death panels" smear was a practiced propagandist, former New York's lieutenant governor Betsy
McCaughey. When Bill Clinton introduced healthcare reform during his first term as president, McCaughey falsely claimed
in an article published in the New Republic that the plan would force consumers to drop their private plans and buy into
the government's programme (the article, widely circulated by Republicans, would go on to win a National Magazine
Award, only to be retracted years later by the New Republic's editors). Now she was back in the spotlight, pushing a
rumour that would be voted by the non-partisan fact-checking website Politifact.com as "the lie of 2009". McCaughey's
latest innuendo was boosted by the cult of political crank Lyndon LaRouche, which mobilised to push the rumour into the
mainstream.
In June 2009, one of LaRouche's top lieutenants publicly confronted Ezekiel Emanuel, the National Institute of Health's
chief bioethicist and brother of White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, accusing him of seeking to reintroduce Hitler's
T-4 programme to kill the handicapped through healthcare reform. "President Obama has put in place a reform apparatus
reviving the euthanasia of Hitler Germany in 1939, that began the genocide there", LaRouche staffer Anton Chaitkin
charged. Soon, LaRouche's followers were on street corners around the country with posters depicting Obama with a
Hitler moustache. At a townhall forum on healthcare reform hosted by Barney Frank, a Democratic Representative, a
LaRouche follower waved one of the Obama-as-Hitler posters and demanded: "Why do you continue to support a Nazi
policy, as Obama has expressly supported this policy?"
Two months later, after Palin whispered the rumour on Facebook, prominent conservatives from former House speaker
Newt Gingrich to ranking Senate finance-committee member Charles Grassley, parroted her claims before audiences of
indignant Tea Paters. Not to be outdone, Glenn Beck devoted an extended rant on his show to the reality of death
panels. Beck, echoing the LaRouche cultists, accused Ezekiel Emanuel of "the devaluing of human life, putting a price on
each individual." He thundered, "The death panel is not a firing-squad. Rationing is inevitable and they know it!"
The death-panel rumour served a variety of functions, all useful to the movement, but not necessarily to the Republican
Party. Most importantly, the rumour resonated both with hard-core libertarians who resented the very existence of the
federal government and Christian right activists who viewed the legalisation of abortion as a slippery-slope to government-
sponsored euthanasia. The hysteria it engendered helped repair the rift exposed by the Terri Schiavo charade in 2005,
when the evangelical conservative James Dobson publicly clashed with Armey, the libertarian leader, over the right of the
government to interfere in a private family matter of life and death.

The slurring of Obama as a sort of sleeper-agent crypto-Muslim helped bring the neo-conservatives back into the fray.
The new neocon generation was led by Dick Cheney's daughter, Liz, who founded an anti-Obama advocacy group, Keep
America Safe, by leveraging donations from pro-Israel sources. Asked by CNN's Larry King about the Birther movement
that was challenging Obama's status as an American citizen, Liz Cheney remarked: "One of the reasons you see people
so concerned about this is people are uncomfortable with having for the first time ever, I think, a president who seems so
reluctant to defend the nation overseas." With the libertarians, Christian right, and the neocons seated around the same
table, united in resentment of the alien president, the conservative movement was whole again.
The experiments in "terror-management theory" developed by three professors of psychology (Sheldon Solomon of
Skidmore College, Jeff Greenberg of the University of Arizona, and Tom Pyszczynski of the University of Colorado) have
demonstrated the connection between fear of death and intensification of conservative attitudes. The findings help explain
the effectiveness of the death-panel rumour and insinuations by conservative figures that Obama was not truly American
and somehow sympathetic to Islamic terrorists. Indeed, these seemingly irrational smears were guided by tactical
reasoning, calculated to agitate voters with constant reminders of their own mortality. Whether or not independent voters
responded, the rhetoric of death kept the Tea Party crowd in a persistent state of panic and rage, ensuring a standing
army ready to fan out to rallies and town halls at the first sign of liberal malfeasance.
Obama's first year in office was marked by more than raucous protests; there were several disturbing murders committed
by far-right extremists. In April 2009, a 22-year-old neo-Nazi wannabe named Richard Poplawsi mowed down a Swat
team of Pittsburgh cops, killing three. Poplawski's best friend told reporters the young killer "grew angry recently over
fears Obama would outlaw guns." Later it was discovered that Poplawski had posted a video-clip to a neo-Nazi website
portraying Fox's Glenn Beck contemplating the existence of concentration-camps. (After a characteristically thorough
investigation, Beck conceded they were not real.) On another occasion, the killer posted a video promoting Tea Party
rallies. A month after the Pittsburgh bloodbath, Scott Roeder, a supporter of the militant anti-abortion group Operation
Rescue, shot Dr George Tiller to death while he prayed at his church in Wichita, Kansas. Tiller was declared fair game by
the anti-abortion movement because of his role as Kansas's only late-term abortion provider. During at least twenty-eight
episodes of Bill O'Reilly's "O'Reilly Factor," O'Reilly had referred to Tiller as "Tiller the baby killer", a criminal guilty of
"Nazi stuff." "I wouldn't want to be [Tiller] if there is a Judgment Day", O'Reilly proclaimed.
In August 2009, a middle-aged professional named George Sodini walked into a health club in suburban Pittsburgh and
gunned down three women. The major media outlets explained Sodini's motives away by homing in on passages in his
online diaries describing his loneliness, inability to convince women to have sex with him, and descent into chronic
masturbation. Nearly every publication omitted or ignored a long deranged entry in which Sodini projected his sexual
frustration onto Obama, whom he seemed to view as a symbol of black male virility and predation.
The day after Obama's election victory, Sodini wrote: "Good luck to Obama! He will be successful. The liberal media
LOVES him. Amerika has chosen The Black Man. Good! In light of this I got ideas outside of Obama's plans for the
economy and such. Here it is: Every black man should get a young white girl ... Kinda a reverse indentured servitude
thing. Every daddy know when he sends his little girl to college, she be ... real good. I saw it. 'Not my little girl', daddy
says! (Yeah right!!) Black dudes have thier [sic] choice of best white?? [ellipses in original]."
In another posting to an anti-Clinton forum in 1994, during the height of the Republicans' Whitewater investigation, Sodini
revealed that he had purchased a bumper-sticker reading, "Stop Socialism, Impeach Clinton," from a National Review ad.
A year later, Sodini ranted on an anti-government militia site: "I am convinced that more drastic action is required to bring
the country back to the Constitutional order that it was 200 years ago. I don't think any group of political leaders will
achieve this for us." Whether or not Sodini's murder-spree was motivated by his political passions, he was pathologically
death-driven and fixated on the phantasmagoria of right-wing imagery. In his final diary entry, Sodini proclaimed: "Death
lives!"
The bible
More than any other media figure of the Obama era, Glenn Beck encouraged the campaign of racial demonisation and
conspiracy that consumed the Tea Party "Patriots". During a broadcast of "Fox and Friends", Beck opined that Obama
"has exposed himself over and over and over again as a guy who has a deep-seated hatred for white people, or the white
culture." As evidence, Beck pointed to White House green-jobs czar Van Jones, an African-American former community
organiser who was eventually forced to resign as a direct result of Beck's crusade. From there, Beck targeted another
black Obama adviser, Valerie Jarrett, highlighting her ties to Acorn while upholding her and Jones as evidence of
Obama's "socialist" agenda. In another broadcast, Beck played an audio clip of unidentified African-Americans referring to
"Obama money" as they collected welfare-cheques in Detroit. Then he showed footage of members of a Kansas City-
based youth group practicing a step show, a traditional African-American group dance apparently unfamiliar enough to
Beck and his transfixed audience that he felt at liberty to claim the footage as evidence that "Obama's SS" was being
trained across inner-city America.

In September 2009, Beck relentlessly targeted Acorn, the rights new favourite hobgoblin, admitting that he intended to
use the poor people's advocacy group to distract his viewers from the healthcare debate. "Trust me", Beck said,
"Everybody now says they're going to be talking about healthcare. I don't think so." (His statement was reminiscent of
Rush Limbaugh's scandal-mongering remark during the early Clinton administration: "Whitewater is about healthcare.")
Beck promptly cued up a series of hidden-camera videos shot by conservative youth activists James O'Keefe and Hannah
Giles inside Acorn field offices.
In the videos, O'Keefe baited African-American staffers into making statements explaining that Giles, who claimed she
was a prostitute, could obtain low-income housing. O'Keefe edited in images of himself clad in an outlandish pimp
costume to create the impression that he was dressed that way during the meetings with Acorn; however, Giles later
admitted her partner had lied about wearing his costume to further incriminate Acorn. In the end, Acorn was exonerated of
all criminal wrongdoing.
In a separate incident O'Keefe was arrested and charged with a federal crime after he and several conservative pals
disguised themselves as telephone repairmen and attempted to wiretap phone-lines in the office of Senator Mary
Landrieu of Louisiana. Like Ryan Sorba, O'Keefe and his posse were movement cadres paid and directed by well-funded
conservative outfits; O'Keefe had been trained by the Leadership Institute, the right-wing youth group that nurtured
leading lights like Jack Abramoff, Karl Rove, Ralph Reed, and Jeff Gannon.
While O'Keefe and his buddies plea-bargained with prosecutors, Beck basked in his formula for success. His show earned
the highest ratings at Fox News, topping network franchises like O'Reilly and Sean Hannity. In the process, Beck's
opinions became firmly implanted in the nervous systems of Tea Party activists. "Glenn Beck has taught us everything we
know", a demonstrator at the 9-12 rally told me. "He's opened our eyes to so much."
But unlike the right-wing radio warhorses who helped usher in Newt Gingrich's Republican counter-revolution of 1994,
Beck was not an authentic product of the movement. When Rush Limbaugh first began dominating the AM airwaves,
Beck was mired in the world of mid-level commercial radio, delivering corny yarns about lesbians and celebrity trash in
hopes of becoming the next Howard Stern. By night, as he has tirelessly recounted, he medicated his anxiety with cocaine
and alcohol, destroying his first marriage in the process. "We remember Glenn from the womanising, the drinking, the
drugs. Everybody who knew him at the time saw what a complete mess he was", a shock- jock from Tampa, Florida, who
called himself Bubba the Love Sponge remarked to me during a broadcast of his nationally syndicated show.
Like Dusty Rhodes, the pseudo-populist demagogue of Elia Kazan's 1957 film, A Face in the Crowd, Beck was a self-
destructive drifter who might have been crumpled up with a bottle of Mad Dog 20/20 in an alleyway or been locked away
in a prison cell had fame not found him first. Beck was only able to stabilise his life when he made his escape from
freedom, marrying a conservative Mormon, converting to her religion, and transmuting his urge to abuse drugs into
conservative radio diatribes.
,When Beck first broke into television on CNN's Headline News Channel, he struggled to articulate a coherent political
worldview. If he distinguished himself from other big-time conservative hosts in any way, he did so through strained and
often snide attempts at humour, remnants of his failed radio career. Nevertheless, with help from his liberal agent,
Matthew Hiltzik, Beck snagged a primetime slot at Fox News in early 2009. Around this same time, Beck began promoting
the work of an arcane Mormon conspiracy-peddler named W Cleon Skousen, whom he described as his political lodestar.
Suddenly, Beck had something more to offer than irritable mental gestures.
Thanks to Beck's designation of Skousen's pseudo-historical tract The 5000 Year Leap as "required reading" on the
website of his 9-12 Project, and his promotion of the book on his show, the previously obscure Skousen became the
Hidden Imam of the Tea Party movement. By summer 2009, Skousen's Leap was among the top ten books on Amazon
and a fixture on literature tables at Tea Party gatherings. It went from selling a puny couple of thousand copies in 2007 to
selling over 200,000 copies in 2009. Just why the book generated such an instant appeal is difficult to understand. It is
little more than a slapdash of quotes from the Founding Fathers, often taken out of context and deliberately oversimplified,
to explain why America is the greatest nation in history. In the process, Skousen claims that church and state separation
is un-American, that "coercive taxation" is communist, and that marriage is the underpinning of a free society. Benjamin
Franklin, who wrote at length on the merits of "amours" with "old women," and who famously solicited prostitutes and
fathered a son of out of wedlock, was the ultimate authority Skousen quoted on the importance of marriage.
Though Skousen claims the Founders as the world's foremost source of eternal wisdom, he buttressed his points with
fringe sources like the conspiracist Norman Dodd's screeds about the Illuminati. According to Skousen, Dodd claimed that
"powerful influences congregating in the United States" like the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds had forced the United
States into the first world war. Skousen published Dodd's manifestoes in his obscure journal Freemen's Digest, which he
founded for the express purpose of propagating conspiracies.

Skousen's paranoid politics were an outgrowth of his participation in extreme anti-communist groups during the 1950s. He
boasted of a close friendship with then-FBI director J Edgar Hoover and said he provided him with research on communist
plots, claims disputed by FBI historians. (During a recent interview, Skousen's son, Paul, told me that contrary to rumours
of Hoover's cross-dressing and homosexual dalliances, he would set the top cop up on blind dates with live women.)
Skousen was fired from his job as Salt Lake City's police chief for, in the words of the city's conservative Mormon mayor,
"conduct[ing] his office as chief of police in exactly the same manner in which the communists operate their government."
From there, Skousen sailed off to the far shores of the right-peddling conspiracy tracts like The Naked Communist, and
earning condemnation from his beloved FBI, which accused him in an internal memo of "promoting [his] own anti-
communism for obvious financial purposes."
Skousen's vocal support for the far-right John Birch Society's claim that communists controlled President Dwight
Eisenhower cost him the support of the corporate backers who had paid for his Red-bashing lecture tours. He went off the
radar for several years, returning during the late 1960s to accuse the Jewish Rothschild family of secretly bankrolling
everyone from Ho Chi Minh to the civil-rights movement. By the late 1970s, even the Church of Latter-Day Saints
distanced itself from Skousen and his conspiracy theories. His work fell through the margins and might have disappeared
entirely had Beck not revived it, turning The 5000 Year Leap into the bible of the Tea Party movement. Alexander Zaitchik
observed in his authoritative profile of Skousen on Salon that Skousen's renewed influence through Beck and the Tea
Party "suggests that the modern base of the Republican Party is headed to a very strange place."
The descent
Besides influencing Beck, Skousen's teachings inspired one of the Tea Party movement's most visible grassroots
celebrities, retired sheriff Richard Mack. I met Mack in February at a far-right rally just outside of Montgomery, Alabama.
On a makeshift stage towed into the middle of a rodeo arena by a pickup truck, Mack recalled with reverence his
mentorship by Skousen, who he said taught him everything he needed to know about the constitution. Mack urged his
spellbound audience to stockpile ammo and store food. "If you control the food supply", Mack warned, "you control the
people. And that's the first step to slavery."
Already a hero to conservatives for successfully suing the Clinton administration over the provision in the Brady Handgun
Violence Prevention Act requiring law enforcement to conduct criminal-background checks of gun purchasers, Mack
reemerged in the Obama era as the archetypal local lawman who vowed to resist the tyrannical federal government.
Along with a few dozen former and active military and law-enforcement personnel, Mack helped form a self-styled Tea
Party militia called the Oathkeepers. Galvanised by their fear of creeping socialism, the Oathkeepers solemnly swore to
refuse tyrannical federal orders such as cooperating with foreign troops and forcing Americans into concentration-camps.
Because the group's members trained for combat, the vow came with suggestion of armed resistance.
Besides Mack, the Oathkeepers attracted a coterie of militia-movement retreads into its ranks. The most well-established
figure was Mike Vanderboegh, a longtime militia fanatic who published a booklet in the mid-1990s entitled Strategy and
Tactics fora Militia Civil War, calling for sniper attacks on "war criminals, secret policemen, rats." With Obama in office,
Vandeboegh churned out anti-government screeds on right-wing blogs with renewed passion and supported his efforts by
cashing in the $1,300 in federal disability compensation he received each month.
For all the energy the far right exerted in its campaign to strangle Obama's agenda, it was a Democrat who posed the
greatest threat to the passage of healthcare reform. Representative Bart Stupak of Michigan had been in office since
1993, placing him among the senior leadership of the so-called centrist Blue Dog Democrats. When healthcare reform
was introduced in Congress, Stupak became the leader of an informal caucus of anti-abortion Democrats, making him the
de facto swing vote on the House version of the bill. By extension, Stupak was the point man in the campaign to ensure
that the bill would not allow federal funding for abortion for low-income women.
But after close consultation with leaders of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, Stupak went a step further. He
introduced a draconian amendment to block women from paying for abortions from even their own private insurance
plans. The amendment, which passed the House but was shut down in the Senate, became a key sticking point in
healthcare negotiations. "He's a big hero now in the pro-life community", Deal Hudson - former Catholic issues adviser to
George W Bush - told me in November 2009. "Thanks to him, this is the first time I can remember the pro-life Democrats
having any power."
To the chagrin of the Republicans, Stupak entertained offers of compromise from the Democratic leadership. According to
Hudson, the Catholic bishops were keen to see healthcare reform pass, but only if the bill contained a clear provision
forbidding patients from spending federal money on abortion. Finally, in March 2010, after pressure from Nancy Pelosi,
Obama agreed to sign an executive order forbidding the federal funding of abortion. Stupak had been mollified. Now he
and his anti-abortion caucus pledged to deliver the swing votes the Democrats needed to pass the bill. As soon as reports
seeped out declaring the imminent passage of healthcare reform, major right-wing blogs like RedState.org churned out

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773028 Date: 08/31/2015
virulent denunciations of Stupak, calling him a traitor and sellout. The blog comment sections filled up with dozens of
diatribes referring to Stupak in language previously reserved for Dr George Tiller: "Bart the Baby-Killer."
On 20 March 2010, thousands of Tea Party activists surrounded the Capitol's Longworth Building in expectation of
Obama's pep talk to the House Democrats and the healthcare vote. Democratic Representative John Lewis, a hero of the
civil-rights movement, and Representative Barney Frank, the first openly gay member of Congress, passed through the
crowd on their way inside the Capitol. "Nigger!" a demonstrator barked at Lewis. Another called Frank a "faggot", eliciting
laughter and cheers from nearby protesters. Meanwhile, as another African-American Democrat, Representative Emanuel
Cleaver, ascended the Capitol steps, a protester who had been screaming at Lewis and Frank spat on his face.
With the demonstration carried on into the night, cries of "Kill the bill!" drifted into calls for violence. "I would gladly stand
with any of you men here and take these fascists down", a man in camouflage battle-dress uniform proclaimed in front of
an amateur videographer, pointing toward the Capitol. "You haven't heard the last of me!"
The next day, Republican members of Congress emerged from the Longworth Building to salute the Tea Paters. The
demonstrators cheered wildly for their proxies on the inside. Finally, after hours of impassioned speeches on the House
floor, the bill passed. But the drama was hardly over.
Republican Representative Joe Pitts, an anti-abortion Catholic who co-authored Stupak's original amendment, demanded
a motion to bring it back to the floor for a vote, a transparent exercise in grandstanding that was certain to fail. In
response, Stupak rushed to the podium with a stinging rebuke to Pitts and the Republicans. "The motion to commit does
not support life", Stupak declared. "It is the Democrats who have stood up...." Heckling from the Republican side
interrupted his statement. As Stupak looked around the House chamber, Representative Randy Neugebauer, a right-wing
Republican from Texas who openly supported the Birther movement, began shouting at him from the backbench, "Baby
killer!" Other Republicans joined in, parroting base insults.
While the Republicans sank their heads in defeat, some more militant devotees of the Tea Party movement called for a
right-wing Kristallnacht. "If you wish to send a message that Pelosi and her party cannot fail to hear, break their windows",
Vanderboegh of the Oathkeepers wrote on a far-right blog hours after the bill passed. "Break them NOW. Break them and
run to break again." Within three days, windows and doors at Democratic Party headquarters in New York, Kansas and
Arizona had been shattered.
Meanwhile, at least ten Democratic members of Congress reported receiving death threats. Images of nooses were faxed
to the offices of Stupak and James Clyburn, an African-American congressman from South Carolina. Representative
Anthony Weiner, an especially vocal proponent of healthcare reform, received a menacing letter filled with white powder.
The brother of Representative Tom Perriello, another healthcare supporter, had his home gas line deliberately sabotaged
after a local Tea Party organiser posted his address online (he had meant to post the congressman's) and encouraged
activists to "drop by" to express their anger about Perriello's recent vote. In Tucson, Arizona, the windows of Democratic
Representative Gabrielle Giffords' office were shattered by shots from a pellet gun. And a brick was thrown through the
window of Representative Louise Slaughter's office in New York as her voicemail filled with threats of impending sniper
attacks.
After the passage of the healthcare bill, the Tea Party floated into a grey zone between authoritarianism and anarchy.
Crusading to restore a holy social order, they promoted disorder. Claiming to protect democracy, they smashed windows
of elected representatives. Warning of death panels, they called in death threats. With the atmosphere of violence
thickening, Palin took to her Twitter account to issue a battle-cry: "Don't Retreat, Instead-RELOAD!" Thus concluded the
first phase of the Obama era that was to usher in a peaceable kingdom of bipartisanship.

Moments of imperial and economic decline
-- according to a recent poll, 65% of
Americans now believe this country to be
"in a state of decline" -- can also be periods
of cultishness, even of madness
incarnate. Such a mood now seems to be
spreading through the United States. It's
not so surprising, really: Since the attacks
of September 11, 2001, fear has
been iniiecttcl into this "homeland" like a
drug and a penumbia of official secrecy has
settled over the land in a way that makes
the secrecy of the Cold War years (when
this country faced a superpower, not a
ragtag set offihadis, guerrillas, and
terrorists) seem like an era of sunshine.
In an atmosphere of swirling fears and
hysteria amid declining living conditions,
"explanations" that at other times might
have remained confined to tiny crews of
conspiracy-mongers can suddenly gain a
patina of plausibility and so traction. No
wonder then that, as hard times hit, as the
financial system seemed on the verge of
collapse, as unemployment soared and a
massive wave of home foreclosures swept
into view, increasing numbers of
Americans became prey to any wacky
explanation for our troubles, none more so
than the idea that Islam was somehow

campaign of islamophobia
wounded President Oba.ma

false rumors about his secret

have tainted views of

among Americans, the

Erupting so many years after

this spasm of anti-Muslim

spontaneous. But think
again: it's the fruit of an
organized, long-term
campaign by a tight
confederation of right-Wing
activists and operatives who
first focused on
Isia.mophobia soon after the
September 11th attacks, but
only attained critical mass
during the Obama era. It

from Tea Party activists here

brings together in common
cause right-wing ultra-
Zionists, Christian
evangelicals, and racist
British soccer hooligans. It
reflects an aggressively pro-
Israel sensibility, with its
key figures venerating the
Jewish state as a Middle
Eastern Fort Apache on the
front lines of the Global
War on Terror and urging
the U.S. and various
European powers to emulate
its heavy-handed methods.
Little of recent American
Jslamophobia (with a.strong
emphasis on the "phobia") is
sheer happenstance. Years
before Tea Party shock
troops massed for angry
protests outside the
proposed site of an Islamic
community center in lower
Manhattan, representatives
of the Israel lobby and the
Jewish-American
establishment launched a
campaign against pro-
Palestinian campus activism
that would prove a seedbed
for everything to come. That
campaign quickly -- and
perhaps predictably --
morphed into a series of
crusades against mosques
and islarilic schools which,
in turn, attracted an
assortment of shady but
exceptionally energetic
militants into the network's
ranks.
Besides providing the initial
energy for the islamophobic
crusade, conservative
elements from within the
pro-Israel lobby bankrolled

national debate. One
philanthropist in particular
has provided the
beneficence to propel the
campaign ahead. He is a
little-known Los Angeles-
area software security
entrepreneur named Aubrey
Chernick, who operates out
of a security consulting firm
blandly named the National
Center for Crisis and
Continuity Coordination. A
former trustee of the
Washington Institute for
Near East Policy, which has
served as a think tank for the
American Israeli Public
Affairs Committee
(AIPAC), a frontline
lobbying group for Israel,
Chernick is said to be worth
$750 million.
Chemick's fortune is puny
compared to that of the
billionaire Koch Brothers,
extraction industry titans
who fund Tea Party-related
groups like Americans for
Prosperity, and it is dwarfed
by the financial empire of

ranging from the Anti-
Defamation League (ADL)
and CAMERA, a right-
wing, pro-Israel, media-
watchdog outfit, to violent
Israeli settlers living on
Palestinian lands and figures
like the pseudo-academic
author Robert Spencer, who
is largely responsible for
popularizing conspiracy
theories about the coming
conquest of the West by
Muslim fanatics seeking to
establish a worldwide
caliphate. Together, these
groups spread hysteria about
Muslims into Middle
American communities
where immigrants from the
Middle East have recently
settled, and they watched
with glee as likely
Republican presidential
frontrunners from Mike
Huckabee to Sarah Palin
pmmoted their cause and
oarpe.ki their tropes.
Perhaps the only thing more
surprising than the
increasingly widespread
appeal of islamophobia is
that, just a few years ago,
the phenomenon was
confined to a few college
campuses and an inner city
neighborhood, and that it
seemed like a fleeting fad
that would soon pass from
the American political
landscape.
Birth of a Network
The fslamophobic crusade
was launched in earnest at
the peak of George W.
Bush's prestige when the
neoconservatives and their
allies were riding high. In
2003, three years after the
collapse of President Bill
Clinton's attempt to resolve

the Israeli-Palestinian issue
and in the immediate wake
of the invasion of Iraq, a
network of Jewish groups,
ranging from ADL and the.
American Jewish
Committee to AIPAC,
gathered to address what
they saw as a sudden rise in
pro-Palestinian activism on
college campuses
nationwide. That meeting
gave birth to the David
Project, a campus advocacy
group led by Charles Peters,
who had co-founded
CAMERA, one of the many
outfits bankrolled by
Chernick. With the help of
public relations
professionals,. Peters
ci a plan to "take
back the campus by
influencing public opinion
through lectures. the
Internet, and coalitions," as
a memo produced at the
time by the consulting firm
McKinsey and Company
stated.
In 2004, after conferring
with Martin Kramer, a
fellow at the Washington
Institute for Near East
Policy, the pro-Israel think
tank Where Chernoff had
served as a trustee, Peters
produced a documentary
film that he called Columbia
"rbecornint., It was -filled
with claims from Jewish
students at Columbia
University claiming they
had endured intimidation
and insults from Arab
professors. The film
portrayed that New York
City school's Department of
Middle East and Asian
Languages and Cultures as a
hothouse of anti-Semitism.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773349 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773349 Date: 08/31/2015
In their complaints, the
students focused on one
figure in particular: Joseph
.vlassa.d, a Palestinian
professor of Middle East
studies. He was known for
his passionate advocacy of
the formation of a binational
state between Israel and
Palestine, as well as for his
strident criticism of what he
termed "the racist character
of Israel." The film
identified him as "one of the
most dangerous intellectuals
on campus," while he was
featured as a crucial villain
in The Professors: The 101
Most Dangerous Academics
in America, a book by the
(Chemick-•funded)
neoconservative activist
David Horowitz. As
Massad was seeking tenure
at the time, he was
especially vulnerable to this
sort of wholesale assault.
When the controversy over
Massad's views intensified,
Congressman Anthony
Weiner, a liberal New York
Democrat who pqee
:lescri himself as a
representative of "the ZOA
[Zionist Organization of
America] wing of the
Democratic Party,"
demanded that Columbia
President Lee Bollinger,
a
renowned First Amendment
scholar, fire the professor.
Bollinger responded by
issuing uncharacteristically
defensive statements about
the "limited" nature of
academic freedom.
In the end, however, none of
the charges stuck. Indeed,
the testimonies in the David
Project film were eventually
either discredited or never
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773349 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773349 Date: 08/31/2015
corroborated. In 2009,
Massad earned tenure after
winning Columbia's
prestigious Lionel Trilling
Award for excellence in
scholarship.
Having demonstrated its
ability to intimidate faculty
members and even powerful
university administrators,
however, Kramer claimed a
moral victory in the name of
his project, boasting to the
press that "this is a turning
point." While the David
Project subsequently
fostered chapters on
campuses nationwide, its
director set out on a
different path -- initially,
into the streets of Boston in
2004 to oppose the
construction of the Islamic
Society of Boston Cultural
Center.
For nearly 15 years, the
Islamic Society of Boston
had sought to build the
center in the heart of
Roxbury, the city's largest
black neighborhood, to
serve its sizable Muslim
population. With
endorsements from Mayor
Thomas Menino and leading
Massachusetts lawmakers,
the mosque's construction
seemed like a fait accompli -
- until, that is, the Rupert
Murdoch-owned Boston
Herald and his local Fox
News affiliate snapped into
action. Boston Globe
columnist Jeff Jacoby also
chimed in with a series of
reports claiming the center's
plans were evidence of a
Saudi Arabian plot to bolster
the influence of radical
Islam in the United States,
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773349 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773349 Date: 08/31/2015
and possibly even to train
underground terror cells.
It was at this point that the
David Project entered the
fray, convening elements of
the local pro-Israel
community in the Boston
area to seek strategies to
torpedo the project.
According to emqiis
obtained by the Islamic
Society's lawyers in a
lawsuit against the David
Project, the organizers
settled on a campaign of
years of nuisance lawsuits,
along with accusations that
the center had received
foreign finding from "the
Wahhabi movement in
Saudi Arabia or... the
Moslem Brotherhood."
In response, a grassroots
coalition of liberal Jews
initiat4d inter-faith efforts
aimed at ending a
controversy that had
essentially been
manufactured out of thin air
and was corroding relations
between the Jewish and
Muslim communities in the
city. Peters would not,
however, relent. 'We are
more concerned now than
we have ever been about a
Saudi influence of local
mosques," he ,apounced at
a suburban Boston
synagogue in 2007.
After paying out millions of
dollars in legal bills and
enduring countless smears,
the Islamic Society of
Boston completed the
construction of its
community center in 2008.
Meanwhile, not surprisingly,
nothing came of the David
Project's dark warnings. As
Boston-area National Public

Radio reporter Philip Martin
reflected in September 2010,
"The horror stories that
preceded [the center's]
development seem shrill and
histrionic in retrospect."
The Network Expands
This second failed campaign
was, in the end, more about
movement building than
success, no less national
security. The local crusade
established an effective
blueprint for generating
hysteria against the
establishment of Islamic
centers and mosques across
the country, while
galvanizing a cast of
characters who would form
an anti-Muslim network
which would gain attention
and success in the years to
come.
In 2007, these figures
coalesced into a proto-
movement that launched a
new crusade, this time
targeting. the Khalil Gibran
International Academy, a
secular Arabic-English
elementary school in
Brooklyn, New York.
Calling their ad hoc pressure
group, Stop the Madrassah
madrassah being simply
the Arab word for "school" -
- the coalition's activists
included an array of
previously unknown zealots
who made no attempt to
disguise their extreme views
when it came to Islam as a
religion, as well as Muslims
in America. Their stated
goal was to challenge the
school's establishment on
the basis of its violation of
the church-state separation
in the U.S.
Constitution. The true aim

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773349 Date: 08/31/2015
of the coalition, however,
was transparent: to pressure
the city's leadership to adopt
an antagonistic posture
towards the local Muslim
community.
The activists zeroed in on
the school's principal,
Debbie Almontaser, a
veteran educator of Yemeni
descent, and baselessly
.branded her "a jihadist" as
well as a 9/11 denier. They
also accused her of-- as
Pamela Geller, a far-right
blogger just then gaining
prominence put it,
"whitewash[ing] the
genocide against the
Jews." Daniel Pipes, a
neoconservative academic
previously active in the
campaigns against Joseph
Massad and the Boston
Islamic center (and whose
pro-Likud think tank,
Middle East .Forum, has
received $150,000 from
Chernick) Jamed the
school should not go ahead
because "Arabic-language
instruction is inevitably
laden with Pan-Arabist and
Islamist baggage." As the
campaign reached a fever
pitch, Almontaser reported
that members of the
coalition were actually
stallsinQ her wherever she
went.
Given what Columbia
Journalism School professor
and former New York Times
reporter Samuel Freedman
called "her clear, public
record of interfaith activism
and outreach," including
work with the New York
Police Department and the
Anti-Defamation League
after the September 11th
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773349 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773349 Date: 08/31/2015
attacks, the assault on
.Almontaser seemed little
short of bizarre -- until her
assailants discovered a
photograph of a T-shirt
produced by AWAAM, a
local Arab feminist
organization, that read
"Intifada NYC." As it
turned out, AWAAM
sometimes shared office
space with a Yemeni-
American association on
which Almontaser served as
a board member. Though
the connection seemed like a
stretch, it promoted the line
of attack the Stop the
Madrassah coalition had
been seeking.
Having found a way to
wedge the emotional issue
of the Israel-Palestine
conflict into a. previously
New York-centered
campaign, the school's
opponents next gained a
platform at the Murdoch-
owned New York Post,
where reporters Chuck
Bennett and Jana Winter
claimed her T-shirt was
"apparently a call for a
Gaza-style uprising in the
Big Apple." While
Almontaser attempted to
explain to the Post's
reporters that she rejected
terrorism„ the Anti-
Defamation League chimed.
in on cue. ADL spokesman
Oren Segal told the Post:
"The T-shirt is a reflection
of a movement that
increasingly lauds violence
against Israelis instead of
rejecting it. That is
disturbing."
Before any Qassam rockets
could be launched from
Almontaser's school, her

former ally New York
Mayor Michael Bloomberg
caved to the growing
pressure and threatened to
shut down the school,
prompting her to resign. A
Jewish principal who spoke
no Arabic replaced
Almontaser, who later filed
a lawsuit against the city for
breaching her free speech
rights. In 2010, the Equal
Employment Opportunity
Commission ui that New
York's Department of
Education had "succumbed
to the very bias that the
creation of the school was
intended to dispel" by firing
Almontaser and urged it pay
her $300,000 in damages.
The commission also
concluded that the Post had
quoted her misleadingly.
Though it failed to stop the
establishment of the Khalil
Gibran Academy,•the
burg:eoning anti-M sliin
movement succeeded in
forcing city leaders to bend
to its will, and having
learned just how to do that,
then moved on in search of
more high-profile targets.
As the ,New York Times
s!..t_..at the time, "The
fight against the school...
was only an early skirmish
in a broader, national
struggle."
s a battle that has really
just begun." Pipes told the
Times.
From Scam to Publicity
Coup
Pipes couldn't have been
more on the mark. In late
2009, the Isiamophobes
sprang into action again
when the Cordoba Initiative,
a non-profit Muslim group
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773349 Date: 08/31/2015

headed by Feisai Abdul
Rauf, an exceedingly
moderate Sufi Muslim imam
who regularly
lepic,,etiting the
United States at the behest
of the State Department,
announced that it was going
to build a community center
in downtown New "NCork
City. With the help of
investors, Raufs Cordoba
Initiative purchased space
two blocks from Ground
Zero in Manhattan. The
space was to contain a
prayer area as part of a large
community center that
would be open to everyone
in the neighborhood.
None of these facts mattered
to Pamela Geller. Thanks to
constant prodding at her

made Cordoba's
construction plans a national
issue, provokino fervent

time blogger the attention
she apparently craved.,
including a • 1 in

frequent cable news spots,

to focus on Geller's bizarre
stunts. She posted a video

Lauderdale beach, for
instance, while ranting about
"left-tards" and "Nazi
Hezbollah." Her gall for
boycotting Campbell's Soup
because the company

food is under Jewish law) --
versions of its products got
her much attention, as did
her .cron-lotior of a screed
claiming that President
Barack Obama was the
illegitimate lovechild of
Malcolm X.
Geller had never earned a
living as a journalist. She
supported herself with
millions of dollars in a
divorce settlement and life
insurance money from her
ex-husband. He died in
2008, a year after being
for an alleged $1.3
million scam he was
accused of-running out of a
car dealership he co-owned
with Geller. Independently
wealthy and with time on
her hands, Geller proved
able indeed when it came to
exploiting her strange media
stardom to in.cite the already
organized political network
of islamophobes to intensify
their crusade.
She also benefited from
close alliances with leading
islamophobes from Europe.
Among Ocher's allies was
Andrew Gravers, a Danish
activist who formed the
group Stop the
Islamicization of Europe,
and :.1a.-ye it the unusually
blunt motto: "Racism is the
lowest form of human
stupidity, but Islamophobia
is the height of common

sense." Gravers' group
inspired Geller's own U.S.-
based outfit, Stop the
Islamicization of America,
which she formed with her
friend Robert Spencer, a
pseudo-scholar whose
bestselling books, including
The Truth About
Muhammad, Founder of the
World's Most Intolerant
Religion, prompted former
advisor to President Richard
Nixon and Muslim activist
Robert Crane to ca/1
"the principal leader... in
the new academic .field of
Muslim bashing."
(According to the website
almost $1 million
in donations from Chernick
has been steered to
Spencer's Jihad Watch
group through David
Horowitz's Freedom
Center.)
Perfect sources for
Republican political figures
in search of the next hot-
button cause, their rhetoric
found its way into the
talking points of Newt
Gingrich and Sarah Patin as
they propelled the crusade
against Cordoba House into
the national spotlight.
Gingrich soon pared the
community center to a Nazi
sign next to the Holocaust
Memorial Museum, while
Patin called it "a stab in the
heart" of "the Heartland."
Meanwhile, Tea Party
candidates like Republican
Ilario Pantano, an Iraq war
veteran who killed two
unarmed Iraqi civilians,
shooting them 60 times -- he
even stopped to reload
made their opppsition to
Cordoba House the

centerpiece of midterm
congressional campaigns
conducted hundreds of miles
from Ground Zero.
Geller's campaign against
"the mosque at Ground
Zero" gained an unexpected
assist and a veneer of
legitimacy from established
Jewish leaders like Anti-
Defamation League
National Director Abraham
Foxman. "Survivors of the
Holocaust are entitled to
feelings that are irrational,"
he et.:narked to the New
York Times. Comparing the
bereaved family members of
9-1 1 victims to Holocaust
survivors, Foxman insisted,
"Their anguish entitles them
to positions that others
would categorize as
irrational or bigoted."
Soon enough, David Harris,
director of the (Chernick-
funded) American Jewish
Committee, was demanding
that Cordoba's leaders be
compelled to reveal their
"true attitudes" about
Palestinian militant groups
before construction on the
center was initiated. Rabbi
Marvin Hier of the Simon
Wiesenthal Center of Los
Angeles, another major
Jewish group, insisted it
would be "insensitive" for
Cordoba to build near "a
cemetery," though his
organization had recently
been granted permission
from the municipality of
Jerusalem to build a
"museum of tolerance" to be
called The Center for
Human Dignity directly on
top of the Mamilla
Cemetery, a Muslim
Graveyard that contained

thousands of grave sites
dating back 1,200 years.
Inspiration from Israel
It was evident from the
involvement of figures like
Gravers that the
Islamophobic network in the
United States represented a
trans-Atlantic expansion of
simmering resentment in
Europe. There, the far-right
was storming to victories in
parliamentary elections
across the continent in part
by appealing to the
simmering anti-Muslim
sentiments of voters in rural
and working-class
communities. The extent of
the collaboration between
European and American
Islamophobes has only
continued to grow with
Geller, Spencer, and even
Gingrich standing beside
Europe's most prominent
anti-Muslim figure, Dutch
pad iamentarian Geed
Wilders, at a rally against
Cordoba House. In the
meantime. Geller was
issuing statements of
sunport for the Emdish
Defense League, a band of
uoorlstruc[ed riec)-Nazis
and former members of the
whites-only British National
Party who intimidate
Muslims in the streets of
cities like Birmingham and
London.
In addition, the trans-
Atlantic Islamophobic
crusade has stretched into
Israel, a country that has
come to symbolize the
network's fight against the
Muslim menace. As Geller
told the New York Times'
Alan Feuer, Israel is "a very
good guide because, like I
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773349 Date: 08/31/2015

said, in the war between the
civilized man and the
savage, you side with the
civilized man."
EDL members regularly
wave Israeli flags at their
rallies, while Wilders claims
to have formed his views
about Muslims during the
time he worked on an Israeli
cooperative farm in the
1980s. He has, he says,
visited the country more
than 40 times since to meet
with rightist political allies
like Aryeh Eldad, a member
of the Israeli Knesset and
leader of the far right
Hatikvah faction of the
National Union Party. He
has called for forcibly
"transferring" the
Palestinians living in Israel
and the occupied West Bank
to Jordan and Egypt. On
December 5th, for example,
Wilders traveled to Israel for
a 'ffrjend nieei,imr, with
Foreign Minister Avi2clor
Lieberman, then declared at
a press conference that
Israel should annex the West
Bank and set up a
Palestinian state in Jordan.
In the apocalyptic clash of
civilizations the global anti-
Muslim network has sought
to incite, tiny armed Jewish
settlements like Yitzar,
located on the hills above
the occupied Palestinian city
of Nablus, represent front-
line fortresses. Inside
Yitzar's state-funded
yeshiva, a rabbi named
Yitzhak Shapira has
instructed students in what
rules must be applied when
considering killing non-
Jews. Shapira summarized
his opinions in a widely
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773349 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773349 Date: 08/31/2015
publicized book. Torat
HaMelech, or The King's
Torah. Claiming that non-
Jews are "uncompassionate
by nature," Shapira cited
rabbinical texts to declare
that gentiles could be killed
in order to "curb their evil
inclinations." "There is
justification," the rabbi
proclaimed, "for killing
babies if it is clear that they
will grow up to harm us, and,
in such a situation they' may
be harmed deliberately, and
not only during combat with
adults."
In 2006, the rabbi was
briefly held by Israeli police
for urging his supporters to
murder all Palestinians over
the age of 13. Two years
later, according to the Israeli
newspaper Ilaaretz, he
a rabbinical letter in
support of Israeli Jews who
had brutally assaulted two
Arab youths on the country's
Holocaust Remembrance
Day. That same year,
Shapira was arrested as a
suspect in helping
a rocket attack
against a Palestinian village
near Nablus.
Though he was not charged,
his name came up again in
connection with another act
of terror when, in January
2010, the Israeli police
raided his settlement
seeking vandals who had set
fire to a nearby mosque.
One of Shapira's followers,
an American immigrant,
Jack _Mite", has confessed to
murdering two innocent
Palestinians and attempting
to the kill the liberal Israeli
historian Ze'ev Sternhell
with a mail bomb.

What does all this have to
do with Islamophobic
campaigns in the United
States? A great deal,
actually. Through New
York-based tax-exempt non-
profits like the Central Fund
of Israel and Ateret
Cohenim, for instance, the
omnipresent Aubrey
Chernick has sent tens of
thousands of dollars to
support the Yitzar
settlement, as well as to the
messianic settlers dedicated
to "Judaizing" East
Jerusalem. The settlement
movement's leading online
news magazine. Arutz
Sheva, has feattired Geller

Subject: H: Predictable Woodward outcome. Sid
aned by Woodward's Fire
by Leslie H. Gelb
September 23, 2010 I 1:32pm
The president and his team cooperated with the famed author's new book. Leslie H. Gelb on the
fallout—and how Obama's Wars shows the U.S. is stuck in an open-ended conflict.
Lots of White House officials observed Bob Woodward, Mr. First Draft of History, repeatedly and boldly slipping behind the
closed doors of President Obama's most intimate advisers. They all knew what was happening. The president's men were
helping The Washington Post's sleuth write "the inside story" of how the boss masterfully managed the most trying of
Herculean labors—the war in Afghanistan. There's only one very big problem in dealing with Woodward in this manner:
Once the boss opens the doors to spilling the secrets, many of his subordinates feel liberated to "tell their side of the
story." By the time each has exhausted tales of his own heroism and the shortcomings of his fellow senior officials, well,
no one looks terribly heroic.
Let's start with Obama, who emerges from the pages of Obama's Wars as he is—brilliant, emotionless, abstract, focused,
and confused, a Chicago law-school professor in presidents' clothes. He obviously wanted Woodward to portray him as a
brilliant intellectual leader of a government that was not giving him too much help in solving the Afghan mystery, but that
he trudged on, doing the best anyone possibly could under these terrible circumstances.
The worst circumstance, as Team Obama alleged to Woodward, was that the Pentagon leadership and the U.S. generals
did not give him the real choices he was asking for. He wanted options for troop increases below, even far below, what
the generals were giving him. He didn't get them. He wanted a strategy for how U.S. forces would be drawn down after
they reached their projected peak of about 100,000 (more than three times the number George W. Bush left him). The
military didn't provide him with that, either.
As they say in Missouri, "Give me a break." If the commander in chief of the United States doesn't know how to get what
he wants from the U.S. military, he might want to do something about that. And some of the many generals in the White
House who he picked to guide him might have told him how to go about that task. To cut to the chase: Obama didn't
understand what he had to do—tell Defense Secretary Bob Gates to tell the generals either they meet the president's
wishes or they will be fired. Republican presidents do just that. And so, as Woodward describes, Obama had to write the
strategy all by himself.
This was and still is an awful situation that springs from two sources. One is that the president has just not been clear
enough about his thinking and objectives for Afghanistan, and the military and the rest of us must have real clarity to
pursue wars. Woodward has this right. Here are a few Obama quotes that illustrate the problem. The president told
Woodward that he didn't think about the Afghan war in the "classic" terms of the U.S. winning or losing. "I think about it
more in terms of: Do you successfully prosecute a strategy that results in the country being stronger rather than weaker at
the end?" What on earth does that mean? Or try this one, to Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) about whether the July 2011
deadline to begin withdrawal was firm: "I have to say that. I can't let this be a war without end, and I can't lose the whole
Democratic Party." Does that mean Obama really believes in the war, but his party doesn't? Or to White House aides:
"This needs to be a plan about how we're going to hand it off and get out of Afghanistan." So, if he wanted such a plan, he
should have gotten such a plan. He is president after all.
Which leads to the second problem: When a president is not clear about a tough problem, the military smells vacillations.
And they sure don't like vacillation when it comes to dispatching their men and women to war. Americans don't fathom
well the military mentality. The military in most countries throughout history doesn't like to go to war; they like to build up
their arms and overall strength. But once in war, they want only more troops, fewer restrictions on their use, and above all,
victory, victory, victory. Since Vietnam, they smell only vacillation among Democrats, and they don't like it. For their part,
Democrats see insubordination and worse among the military toward them, and they don't care for the suits either. It's not
a happy circumstance. Woodward didn't explore this underlying reality, which is critical for Americans to understand.
breakAd
The White House clash with the military could get worse over the latest news about Gen. Stanley McChrystal's firing over
naughty things said about the White House to a reporter. According to a preliminary Army investigation, the general—and

perhaps even his senior Army aides—were not the sources of those nasty quotes. It was some other guys—you know, the
usual culprits, the Navy and civilians. There will be further formal inquiries on this, but nothing good will come of them.
There's another important thread running throughout the Woodward account that, I believe, he gets more wrong than
right. That is, Woodward's repeated insistence of open and bitter policy brawls in the good old Situation Room (the inner
sanctum for White House meetings) over Afghan policy. Mr. Instant Historian paints a picture of a war of all against all. My
information has always been that there was relative agreement on major policy. Based on my sources, there is no doubt
that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Defense Secretary Bob Gates, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mike Mullen were almost
always quite cordial and in full lock step. They, along with the NSC Adviser Jim Jones and field commanders like General
McChrystal and General Petraeus, are the key players. Of course, Vice President Joe Biden and Chief of Staff Rahm
Emanuel were the only regular critics of where policy was heading. The generals did lobby for their positions in public—in
advance of presidential decisions. And that's a big no-no. But by that standard, almost all Obama's top advisers did as
much. The day after his West Point speech last December, where he set the firm date of July 2011 to begin unspecified
U.S. troop withdrawals, almost all the advisers publicly stated that maybe one didn't have to take this date too seriously,
that everything was "conditions based." That group of rebels included Gates and Clinton.
So, if anything, most of Obama's top counselors were more or less united—sometimes against where he seemed to be
going. Here is what Petraeus had to say to Woodward on the subject of goals, and it's a stunner: "You have to recognize
also that I don't think you win this war. I think you keep fighting. It's a little bit like Iraq, actually.... Yes, there has been
enormous progress in Iraq. But there are still horrific attacks in Iraq, and you have to stay vigilant. You have to stay after
it. This is the kind of fight we're in for the rest of our lives and probably our kids' lives." The brilliant general said as much
to others over the last year. It's enough to knock your socks off.
So far, there are no heroes to this narrative, only self-described heroic skeptics of the war and warriors who would fight on
forever.
Doubtless, President Obama does not want to fight an open-ended war. He's sworn to that time and again, and I believe
him, despite his history of calling for "victory" and "defeat" of the Taliban and al Qaeda. But what the Woodward book
demonstrates is that Obama and his team just don't know how to get from here to there. So far, there are no heroes to
this narrative, only self-described heroic skeptics of the war and warriors who would fight on forever.

Re: Iran, Saudi
Had dinner last night (Tuesday, February 16) with Joschka Fischer. We had an interesting
conversation on Iran and Saudi Arabia, among other things. (As you know Fischer is now
director of the Nabucco pipeline project.) On Iran, harsh, targeted sanctions are absolutely
necessary, but are most effective diplomatically when always coupled with an offer to negotiate.
The iron fist in the velvet glove approach achieves several objectives: According to Fischer's
intelligence, Ahmanijehad wished some negotiated settlement but was blocked. The regime has
splits at the top. Perhaps true, perhaps not. But constantly pushing negotiations alongside
sanctions puts additional pressure on internal divisions, whatever they are. Extending an open
hand while brandishing a stick closes diplomatic and political room to maneuver for Iran. Its
refusal to accept the open hand justifies application of the stick. Even when sanctions are
enforced it always remains useful to say another way is open. The damage done to Iran is
therefore the result of its own choice. This approach also aids the opposition. A purely condign
sanctions strategy can contribute to the regime's will to punish and tighten repression. Talking of
regime change, of course, undermines the cause of regime change. It is a gift to the regime. The
opposition is a new factor in the Iran equation that must be taken into account on the political
and moral level. Pushed to the wall, the regime may feel compelled to repress, which might
involve thousands or tens of thousands of political killings. On Saudi Arabia, Fischer points out
that if Iran develops nuclear weaponry the Saudis already have their own bomb. The Saudis
invested in Pakistan's nuclear weaponry partly for this eventuality; that's their bomb in reserve.

Iraq. I also assume that you saw the report last June that they were seized by a Revolutionary Guard officer now held for

US Hikers Were Seized in Iraq
By Babak Sarfaraz
Posted on June 24, 2010, Printed on October 22, 2010
http://www.theinvestigativefund.org/investigations/internationa1/1338/
KURDISTAN PROVINCE, IRAN—
Since their arrest last July by Iranian forces near the Iraq
border, three Americans — Shane Bauer, Josh Fattal and
Sarah Shourd — have been at the center of a high-stakes
diplomatic struggle between Tehran and Washington. Iranian
authorities have repeatedly accused the three of entering Iran
to conduct espionage. Meanwhile, friends and family of the
three, along with the State Department, the Committee to
Protect Journalists, The Nation and The Investigative Fund
[Bauer has written Investigative Fund stories that appeared in
The Nation and Mother Jones], have rejected the spying
charge and suggested that the Americans accidentally crossed
the border while on a recreational hike. Despite a well-
publicized visit by the detainees' mothers in May, Iran has
released little information about the circumstances of their
arrest or the status of their case.
The Nation and The Investigative Fund have located two
witnesses to the arrest who claim that Bauer, Fattal and
Shourd were on Iraqi territory when they were arrested — not
in Iran, as Iranian officials have asserted. Two additional
sources report that the Revolutionary Guards officer who
likely ordered their detention has since been arrested on
charges of smuggling, kidnapping and murder.
The witnesses are residents of a Kurdish village in Iraq called
Zalem, which lies a few miles from the Iran border; they
declined to be identified, fearing retaliation from Iranian
forces, who have been known to conduct missions across the
border. The witnesses separately reported noticing the three
Americans as they hiked up a mountain in the scenic Khormal

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774160 Date: 08/31/2015
region, which straddles the border. Part of the mountain lies
in Iraq and part in Iran, but except for a few watchtowers and
occasional signposts, the border here is largely unmarked,
although local residents are familiar with its boundaries.
The witnesses, who followed the Western-looking hikers out
of curiosity, say that around 2 pm on July 31, as the hikers
descended the mountain, uniformed guards from NAJA,
Iran's national police force, waved the hikers toward the
Iranian side using "threatening" and "menacing" gestures.
When their calls were ignored, one officer fired a round into
the air. As the hikers continued to hesitate, the guards walked
a few yards into Iraqi territory, where they lack jurisdiction,
and apprehended them.
These witness accounts corroborate a statement Bauer made
on May 20 during a tele-vised reunion at a Tehran hotel
between the hikers and their mothers. As the New York Times
reported, Bauer "denied that they had walked into Iran, as
they were accused of doing, before stopping himself and
saying, 'We can't really talk about that."
Farhad Lohoni, a local tribal leader, had previously claimed
that the American hikers had been snatched from Iraq in a
cross-border raid by Iranian agents, as reported in the Daily
Telegraph in August 2009. Lohoni said that his relatives had
seen a group of men cross the border into Iraq, and he told the
Telegraph that the hikers "were targeted and captured by a
group that came over from Iran, ignoring Iraq's sovereignty.
We know this and it means that Iran must have wanted to take
Americans hostage at this sensitive time."
A State Department spokesman said that he had been unaware
of evidence that the three were arrested in Iraqi territory but
would not comment further.
Once captured, Bauer, Fattal and Shourd were sped by car to
the local headquarters of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in
Marivan, a town close to the border in the province of
Kurdistan. When they arrived, according to two sources, the
Americans were remanded into the custody of Lt. Col. Heyva
Taab, then head of the Revolutionary Guards' intelligence
unit in the region. According to these sources — a former
member of the Revolutionary Guards and an official who
serves in the provincial government at Sanandaj — only Taab
would have had the authority to order the Americans'
detention and eventual transfer to Tehran. A branch of the
Iranian military with at least 125,000 personnel, the
Revolutionary Guards are responsible for maintaining
national security throughout the Islamic Republic.
"When I heard the news that they had arrested American
hikers, I immediately thought, This is the work of the
intelligence arm of the Revolutionary Guards, because they
have people in this region," says Idris Ahmedi, an Iranian
Kurdish exile and a regional expert who is a visiting scholar
at Georgetown University. "I thought they were most likely

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774160 Date: 08/31/2015
lured into Iranian Kurdistan, where they could arrest them. It
is consistent with Iran's past actions."
Less than a month later, in late August 2009, Taab himself
was arrested and charged with the July 6 murder of the son of
Mostafa Shirzadi, the Imam Joma (Friday prayer leader) of
Marivan, an influential cleric in the region. Shirzadi's nephew
was also allegedly killed by Taab. Since his arrest Taab has
been implicated in a vast criminal enterprise encompassing a
profitable smuggling operation and dozens of murders, rapes
and kidnappings. According to the Sanandaj official,
numerous lawsuits, perhaps hundreds, have been filed against
Taab in Kurdistan, alleging libel, theft, rape, kidnapping and
murder. Taab's case has twice been before a judge, and he
awaits execution in a Tehran prison.
Although the state-run Iranian press has not reported on
Taab's crimes, they were made public in a series of articles in
January and February by a Kurdish news site, Kurdistan Va
Kurdnews, run by the Kurdistan Democratic Party. A
February 17 article describes Taab as the head of a "criminal
band" and reports that Taab and seven accomplices were
under arrest by the Revolutionary Guards for their role in a
vast number of illegal killings.
Several sources describe Taab as the central power in
Kurdistan province. According to locals and experts, control
of the border lies in the hands of the Revolutionary Guards, in
particular their intelligence unit, Etelaat Sepah, whose local
division had been commanded by Taab for about five years.
"At this point it's really the Sepah, the Revolutionary Guards,
that are in charge, especially in the western provinces,
especially because the Americans are on the other side, in
Iraq," says Kaveh Ehsani, an assistant professor of
international studies at DePaul University and an Iran expert
who serves as a contributing editor to the journal Middle East
Report. "On the surface the security force [NAJA] is in
charge, but it really is the Revolutionary Guards that control
the borders."
It is a region where, according to several Iran experts,
smuggling and cross-border traffic are routine. The Iraq-Iran
border is "relatively porous because it's mountainous," says
Faraz Sanei, an Iran researcher at Human Rights Watch,
which issued a report last year on political freedom in Iranian
Kurdistan. Sanei describes the border as a common escape
route for dissidents —journalists, human rights advocates
and Iranian Kurds—as well as a commonly used trade route
for goods. "Smuggling is something that has taken place and
continues to take place there, whether it be of goods or of
humans across the border. It's something that happens quite
often."
Soon after Taab took charge of the Sepah in the northwestern
quadrant of Kurdistan, he began to enrich himself off the
black-market border economy. According to the Sanandaj

official and the former Revolutionary Guards officer, who
had firsthand knowledge of Taab's activities, Taab's first
scheme involved selling merchandise confiscated from petty
smugglers, known as koolbars, who traffic consumer goods
across the border (a trade depicted in the Iranian film A Time
for Drunken Horses, which won the Camera d'Or at Cannes
in 2000).
The region is also home to a variety of Kurdish nationalist
groups that have been demanding autonomy from the central
Tehran government. One of these, the Party for Free Life in
Kurdistan (PJAK), is affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers'
Party, a Kurdish separatist organization that engages in armed
conflict within Turkey and has been labeled a terrorist
organization by the United States and other governments.
Since 2005 PJAK, based in the mountains in Kurdish Iraq,
has been in open conflict with Tehran and has claimed
responsibility for killing dozens of Revolutionary Guards
soldiers in cross-border raids on Iranian military bases, as
well as for the February 2007 downing of an Iranian military
helicopter by a shoulder-launched missile in Khoy, in
Western Azerbaijan province, which killed thirteen Iranian
soldiers.
It has been speculated that some of these Kurdish militants
enjoy US support. In April 2006, Representative Dennis
Kucinich wrote a letter to President Bush questioning whether
the US government was "fomenting opposition and
supporting military operations in Iran among insurgent groups
and Iranian ethnic minority groups, some of whom are
operating from Iraq." Kucinich named two groups, including
PJAK. In November of that year, Seymour Hersh reported in
The New Yorker that "Israel and the United States have also
been working together in support of a Kurdish resistance
group known as the Party for Free Life in Kurdistan," and that
a government consultant told him that the Israeli government
had provided "equipment and training" to PJAK.
The United States and Israel have denied any involvement
with PJAK. Still, these allegations of support have gained
substantial traction inside Iran and may have undergirded
Taab's decision to detain Bauer, Fattal and Shourd as well as
the repeated public charges of espionage against the three. In
early April, for instance, Iranian Intelligence Minister Heydar
Moslehi told Iran's Press TV that "it is quite obvious to us
that the three Americans arrested in Iran last year had links
with Western and Israeli intelligence services."
The Iranian government has retaliated against rising Kurdish
militancy by launching a counteroffensive on PJAK, inside
Iran and across the border in Iraq. In August 2007, for
example, Iranian soldiers crossed into Iraq and attacked
several villages, McClatchy reported. Most recently, on June
4, officials in Iraq's semiautonomous Kurdish region alleged
that "a small unit of Iranian soldiers," including a tank and

several other vehicles, had penetrated more than a mile into
Iraqi Kurdistan's Arbil province in search of Kurdish rebels.
Until his arrest, Taab was a key player in Iran's counter-
offensive. The former Revolutionary Guards officer says that
several current members of the Guards told him that Taab's
stated goal was to "completely wipe out PJAK" in his
jurisdiction. According to Alunedi, the scholar at
Georgetown, Taab was involved in recent cross-border
assassinations of Iranian Kurds in Iraqi Kurdistan. The
Kurdish weekly Awena reported that Taab and his unit
assassinated two Kurds on December 15, 2008.
According to the former officer and the Sanandaj official,
Taab's criminal enterprise grew beyond smuggling in 2007,
when he made his first forays into murder. Koolbars, the petty
border smugglers, are often killed by land mines or fatally
shot by border police. So Taab concocted a scheme to kidnap
koolbars as well as ordinary unemployed Iranian Kurdish
civilians, dress them in the uniforms of PJAK insurgents and
then kill them—claiming they'd died in a military clash—in
order to collect a bounty, as high as $40,000 a head, from his
superiors in the Revolutionary Guards. He was assisted in this
plot by at least nine others, seven of whom have been
apprehended. The article in Kurdistan Va Kurdnews named
all seven, including Haji Majid Muqimiyan of Kermansha,
identified as a ringleader.
PJAK has officially denied involvement in these border
clashes, including in a May 3, 2009, post to the Iranian
website Tabnak, which is published by Mohsen Rezai, a
former head of the Revolutionary Guards. Many of the PJAK
clashes may, in fact, have been "bogus," said the Sanandaj
official. "More or less no clashes with PJAK have been
reported in the area since Heyva Taab and his gang were
busted."
A mother of one koolbar tearfully described her son's
disappearance. She said he went missing the same day in
early 2009 that the government later claimed a clash with
PJAK had taken place. The woman, a resident of a border
town in Iranian Kurdistan, is a plaintiff in one of the lawsuits
against Taab; she asked that her name and location not be
mentioned, for fear that it would harm her case in court.
Taab's scheme was wildly successful, according to the
Sanandaj official, who said one bank account under Taab's
name has had nearly $6 million deposited in it since 2008.
This macabre scheme ended only in the spring of 2009, when
Taab killed a local official's brother who was seeking work in
the area and, more decisively, last July when he killed the
cleric's son.
On June 11 Mohammad Javad Larijani, secretary general of
Iran's High Council for Human Rights, said that the
government's investigation was nearly complete and a trial
for Bauer, Fattal and Shourd "should not be very far from

now." In a statement issued on June 17, the mothers of the
hikers called on Iran either to prosecute or release their
children. "Iran has no legitimate reason at this stage not to
release them or move forward with a fair trial in which our
children can openly answer any allegations against them."
"These new revelations, if indeed true, show the hikers have
been victims of political machinations and manipulation,"
said Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the International
Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. "The fact that they have
been held for so long without prosecution strongly supports
this trend. Under Iranian laws, they have committed no crime
and should be released immediately. Their Iranian lawyer,
who has studied the judicial files against them, has
consistently maintained the only charge against them is illegal
entry, which is subject to a fine and not arbitrary detention for
so long. With this new information, even that charge appears
fabricated, and there is no basis for holding them."
As of the press date, Shane Bauer, Josh Fattal and Sarah
Shourd have been detained by Iran for ten months and
twenty-three days.

Iran Seized U.S. Hikers in Iraq, U.S. Report
Asserts
By MICHAEL R. GORDON and ANDREW W. LEHREN
Iran has accused three American hikers of illegally crossing into Iranian territory in July 2009 and is still holding two of
them in prison. But a classified American military report made public by WikiLeaks, which describes the chaotic day when
the hikers were detained, asserts that the hikers were on the Iraqi side of the border when they were seized.
The initial reports of any incident are not always correct. But one American government official who served in Iraq said
that the field report was generally consistent with what he had been told by Iraqi officials — namely, that the hikers were
close to the border but on the Iraqi side.
The episode began when four Americans traveled from Syria to northern Iraq, planning to hike up the Ahmed Awa, a
mountainous area with a dramatic waterfall. One American, Shon Meckfessel, became ill and stayed behind when his
friends — Shane M. Bauer, Joshua F. Fattal and Sarah E. Shourd — set out on July 31.
A July 31 field report states that Mr. Meckfessel learned of the arrests when a "female called him saying they were being
surrounded by armed men."

At first, the American military did not know who was holding the Americans. An intelligence officer at the American Army
division based in northern Iraq, the report notes, initially described the event as a "kidnapping" and said the three
American tourists "were being taken to the Iranian border."
The report lists a number of military grids where the Americans were believed to have been hiking or had been detained
— all on the Iraqi side of the border.
As documented in the report, the frenetic effort to locate the American hikers and to inter-view Mr: Meckfessel appeared to
support the claim that they were tourists and not American intelligence operatives, as Iran has alleged. A drone aircraft
was sent to look for the missing Americans, and two F-16s jet fighters were alerted. American Special Operations forces
were sent to pick up Mr. Meckfessel, so he could be taken to Baghdad for questioning.
As the day wore on, the Americans received a report from an officer with the pesh merga, the Kurdish military force in
northern Iraq, that the Iranians had detained three American citizens "for being too close to the border." The July report
reflects some frustration with the hikers for their "lack of coordination" in venturing to northern Iraq and offers some
thoughts on the episode's broader implications.
"The leadership in Iran benefits as it focuses the Iranian population on a perceived external threat rather than internal
dissension," it notes. Read the Document >>

John Rentoul: The party voted for David
Miliband but got the Panda instead
New Labour leader won't stand a chance against David
Cameron
The result is the worst possible for the Labour Party. A decisive victory for Ed Miliband would have been one thing. The
party would have made the wrong decision, but it would have done so with its eyes open and with the leader's legitimacy
unchallenged.
Instead, Ed Miliband lost the election in two parts of Labour's electoral college, among MPs and among Labour Party
members, but won thanks to a 60-40 margin the other way among trade union members on a very low turnout.
If he had won by a clear margin I would have said that Labour had chosen the Panda as its leader. He is soft, cuddly and
panders to every oppositional instinct in the party. There has been no position taken by the Labour government of which
he was a member that he was not prepared to trash if he thought Labour members would like it. Tuition fees, Iraq, the
third runway for Heathrow: you name it, he disowned it. Even, in the case of the third runway, a policy for which he had
direct ministerial responsibility. There has been no part of the manifesto, which he wrote, that he has not been prepared to
ditch.
But that is not what the party did. Labour Party members chose David Miliband. Labour MPs chose David. The party itself
voted for what Ed Miliband tried to dismiss as the "New Labour Establishment", in other words, the supposedly hated
Blairites. The party read the signals from the voters correctly. It knows that, although it didn't do as badly as it feared in the
general election, a lurch to the left was not the answer. Party members and MPs took on board Tony Blair's warning that
Labour lost because Gordon Brown "moved a millimetre" to the left of New Labour. They did not fall for the argument that
Labour did better than expected by moving a millimetre to the left and, therefore, to do better still they needed to move a
couple of centimetres further to the left.
They did not think that, because Labour has pulled level in the opinion polls, the next election is in the bag. They know
that the opposition party often moves ahead of the government in the opinion polls within months of an election. They also
know that Labour's poll rating is artificially inflated by the absence from the fray of the Liberal Democrats as a protest
party, and they know that this protest vote cannot be relied upon in a general election.
The Labour Party and Labour MPs got it right, and the election was won by an operation run by the trade union machines.
That means that Ed Miliband, who would have struggled against David Cameron in the House of Commons in any event,
is going to be roasted every week.
Every week, the Prime Minister is going to point out that the Leader of the Opposition does not have the support of the
members on the benches behind him. Not only that, he does not have the support of the members of his party in the
country. Every week, Cameron is going to portray Miliband as the place person of the trade union bosses and the
beneficiary of a boss-politics stitch-up.
If Ed Miliband had won the party members but lost among MPs, which is what I expected, the Conservatives would have
teased him in the Commons, but he would have had as much legitimacy as lain Duncan Smith - the choice of the party
activists against the wishes of his MPs. No wonder Ed was the "cork-popper" candidate in Conservative HQ. The way

things have turned out, that's not just a phrase; it would be worth lifting the austerity ban on bubbly for. David Cameron,
lucky general, faces an opponent with less of a mandate than IDS.
Even if Ed Miliband had won comfortably in all three sections of Labour's electoral college, I feel he would have struggled
against Cameron. This way, I fear that he fights with both hands tied behind his back.

October 24, 2010
From: David Brock
Re: Memo on Impeaching Clarence Thomas
Lillian McEwen — a former prosecutor, law professor and administrative law judge --says publicly for the first time she was
romantically involved with Clarence Thomas during the entire time that Anita Hill worked for Thomas. She was
subpoenaed neither by the Democrats nor the Republicans during the hearings (even though she wrote a personal note to
Biden, for whom she had once worked on the Judiciary Committee, telling him that she had personal knowledge of
Thomas). Her recent interviews with the Washington Post (10-22) and The NY Times (10-23) and the ABC Washington
affiliate (10-23) are the first record of her information.
(Personal note: During my reporting for The Real Anita Hill, every potential friendly witness for Thomas was made
available to me through close Thomas associates. They held McEwen forth to me as evidence that her relationship with
Thomas negated the possibility that he pressured Hill to date him and also that Hill's knowledge of the relationship made
Hill angry that she could not attract Thomas's romantic attention. In his Senate testimony Thomas himself had made that
suggestion in an exchange with Specter. Thomas said he had tensions with Hill because of "the complexion of the woman
I dated." McEwen is light-skinned. McEwen, assumed by me to be a friendly witness, was NOT made available to me by
the Thomas associates, however. It is now obvious why. They knew better).
PORNOGRAPHY IN THE WORKPLACE
NYT: Ms. McEwen said that pornography for Justice Thomas was "just a part of his personality structure." She said he
kept a stack of pornographic magazines, "frequented a store on Dupont Circle that catered to his needs" and allowed his
interest in pornography to bleed into his professional relationships.
Dowd (10/24): In her interviews McEwen confirmed Thomas's obsession with women with "huge, huge breasts," with
scouting the women he worked with as possible partners and with talking about porn at work— while he was the head of
the federal agency that polices sexual harassment.
Thomas testimony:
Leahy: Let me ask you — she has asked whether this happened — let me ask you: Did you ever have a discussion of
pornographic films with Professor Hill?
Thomas: Absolutely not.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775405 Date: 08/31/2015
LEAHY: Have you ever had such discussions with any woman?
Thomas: Senator, I will not get into any discussion that I might have had about my personal life or my sex life with any
person outside the workplace.
Leahy: I'm not asking –
Thomas: I will categorically say that I have not had any such discussions with Professor Hill.
Leahy: Please don't misunderstand my question judge. I am confining it to the workplace. I have no interest in what may
be your personal life in this. That's yours. What I'm asking is within – she alleges within the workplace. Make sure I fully
understand—I'm asking you this question so that you can give the answer. Am I correct in understanding your answer,
within the workplace with Professor Hill, you never had such a discussion?
Thomas: Right.
Leahy: You never had such discussions within the workplace with any other women?
Thomas: That's right.
Leahy: Or with anyone for that matter?
Thomas: Right.
WORKPLACE BEHAVIOR
WP: To McEwen, Hill's allegations that Thomas had pressed her for dates and made lurid sexual references rang familiar.
"He was always actively watching the women he worked with to see if they could be potential partners. It was a hobby of
his."
WP: According to McEwen, Thomas would also tell her about women he encountered at work. He was partial to women
with large breasts, she said. In an instance at work, Thomas was so impressed that he asked one woman her bra size,
McEwen recalled him telling her.
McEwen told ABC News (10-22): "He was constantly evaluating women in terms of whether they would be a good sex
partner or not."
Thomas testimony:
"Senator [Biden] my attitude at work was in my work environment my staffs were almost invariably predominantly women.
The senior person on my staff was a woman. I could not tolerate individuals making that environment uncomfortable or
hostile. I could tolerate individuals who had to segregate their language or conduct in order to get along. The conduct had
to be purged of offensive attitudes and I made a constant effort, and that was something that I was proud of and it was
something I am sure the people who worked for me felt comfortable with and understood."
WP: In her Senate testimony, Hill, who worked with Thomas at two federal agencies, said that Thomas would make
sexual comments to her at work, including references to scenes in hard-core pornographic films.
Thomas testimony:
"If I used that kind of grotesque language with one person it would seem to me that there would be traces of it throughout
the employees who worked closely with me; there would be other individuals who heard it, or bits and pieces of it, or
various levels of it."
SUPPRESSED EVIDENCE
There were five other individuals, including now McEwen, who had first-hand knowledge of Thomas's behavior as Hill
described it, but none testified in the hearing.
NYT: Ms. McEwen has generally kept a low profile all these years, largely, she explains, out of respect for the wishes of
Justice Thomas, who asked her to "take the same position toward him as his first wife had take" and not speak publicly
about their relationship. A former prosecutor and judge, she is now retired.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775405 Date: 08/31/2015
WP: McEwen recalls writing Thomas a short note before the confirmation hearings, curious about what she should say if
she were quizzed about their relationship. She said Thomas preferred that she would take the same attitude of his first
wife" who never talked publicly about their relationship.
WP: Angela Wright, who in 1984 worked as a public affairs director at the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission —
which polices sexual harassment claims — during Thomas's long tenure as chairman, shared similar accounts with Senate
investigators. Once when walking into an EEOC seminar with Thomas, he asked her "What size are your breasts?"
according to the transcript of her Senate interview.
WP: Her (Wright's) story was corroborated by a former EEOC speechwriter, Rose Jourdain, who told Senate investigators
that Wright had become increasingly uneasy around Thomas because of his comments about her appearance.
WP: Another woman, Sukari Hardnett, who worked as a special assistant to Thomas in 1985 and 1986, wrote in a letter to
the Judiciary Committee: "If you were young, black, female and reasonably attractive, you knew full well you were being
inspected and auditioned as a female" by Thomas.
Neither Wright, nor Rose Jourdain (her corroborator), nor Sukari Hardnett testified at the hearing. As he drew the hearing
to a close, Biden lifted a subpoena for Wright to testify and instead transcripts of the interviews with Wright and her
corroborator were simply entered into the record then the hearing was concluded, and Thomas was confirmed the next
day.
Dowd: "For the written record Biden allowed negative accounts only from women who had worked for Thomas. He also
ruled out testimony from women who simply had personal relationships with Thomas, and he did not respond to a note
from McEwen — as a former US attorney who had once worked as a counsel for Biden's committee — reminding him of her
long relationship with Thomas."
INTIMIDATING A WITNESS
A fourth woman with knowledge of Thomas's behavior, Kaye Savage, was first named in a 1994 book Strange Justice by
Jill Abramson and Jane Mayer. Savage was a close colleague of Thomas's and Hill's in the Reagan Administration.
Savage was interviewed by Judiciary Committee staff after she contacted the committee, and a staffer made notes, but
she was never called to testify. Her story did not become public until Abramson and Mayer obtained the staff notes and
interviewed Savage, who told the authors of visiting Thomas's apartment during the time Hill was working for Thomas and
observing stacks of pornographic magazines and all of the walls of the apartment papered with centerfolds of large-
breasted nude women.
From Blinded by the Right:
"The biggest problem raised by the Strange Justice authors for the Thomas camp was the testimony of yet another
woman, Kaye Savage, who had not been heard from during the first round of hearings."
"I called Mark Paoletta (a close Thomas friend and former associate White House counsel under Bush) at his Washington
law office and discussed the Savage matter with him. Mark had been helping me on all other aspects of (my) review (of
Strange Justice for The American Spectator) and we developed a plan for dealing with Savage. I needed to find out
quickly who she was and what negative information might exist about her before confronting her and trying to force her
into backing off the story she had told the Strange Justice authors. I was intent on doing to Savage what had been done to
Anita Hill and Angela Wright during the Thomas hearings. Mark said he would call Clarence Thomas (then a sitting
Justice) and see what he could find out."
"Within an hour or so that morning Mark phoned me back. He said he had posed my question about how to discredit
Savage to Thomas, who knew I was at work on a review of the Mayer and Abramson book. (Personal note: I had
personally told Thomas this when I met him at a Paoletta family event only days prior). Mark told me that Thomas had, in
fact, some derogatory information on his former friend Savage; he passed it along to Mark so that Mark could give it to
me. Quoting Thomas directly, Mark told me of unverified embarrassing personal information about Savage that Thomas
claimed had been raised against her in a sealed court record of a divorce and child custody battle more than a decade
ago. Thomas also told Mark where Savage worked after Mark related that I was eager to hunt her down as soon as
possible. Surely skirting the bounds of judicial propriety to intimidate and smear yet another witness against him, Thomas
was playing dirty and so was I."
After an excerpt of Blinded featuring the Savage story was published in TALK magazine in 2001, The NYT reported (6-27-
01): "Reached at home in Washington last night, Ms. Savage said that Mr. Brock had tried to intimidate her but that he

had not told her the source of the negative information. 'I didn't think to ask,' she said. But she said that she had shared
the information about her divorce with few people and that Justice Thomas and Ms. Hill were 'primarily' those to whom
she had confided. 'He either got it from Clarence or he got it from Anita, Ms. Savage said. 'and Anita's my friend."
(Personal note: Though I confronted Savage with the information in an effort to get her to recant, she never did, although I
made it appear otherwise by journalistic sleight-of-hand involving a written statement Savage had given me under duress
about her interviews with Mayer and Abramson in my Spectator review).
Frank Rich, NYT (12-29-94): "This time Mr. Brock's partisan desperation has led him to a tactic that is beyond the pale of
even tabloid journalism and that would make any citizen think twice before speaking freely to any journalist: He tried to
bully a source in Strange Justice, a one-time Hill and Thomas associate named Kaye Savage, to get her to sign a
statement denying her own contribution to the book."
Jamin Raskin, a law professor and associate dean at American University in Washington, received a call seeking advice
from Ms. Savage after her encounter with Mr. Brock a few weeks ago: "She was distraught and said Brock was
threatening to reveal damaging information about her from a divorce situation unless she agreed to retract everything she
had said to the authors of Strange Justice, he said in an interview. 'I told her this is a clear violation of journalistic ethics
and might be blackmail and that she shouldn't give in to it. She was beside herself because she had told the truth."
MORE CONFIRMATION ON PORNOGRAPHY
Blinded by the Right:
"I next set out to blow away the Mayer and Abramson story that Thomas had been a frequent customer of an X-rated
video store near Dupont Circle, called Graffiti, where in the early 1980s he was alleged to have rented X-rated videos of
the type that Hill claimed he had discussed with her in graphic terms. In the hearings Thomas had pointedly refused to
answer questions about his personal use of pornography, other than to categorically deny that he had ever talked about
porn with Hill (or with anyone in the workplace). The Graffiti story was another theretofore unknown piece of evidence for
Hill's case..."
"Now that Mark had opened up a channel directly to Thomas, I asked him to find out for me whether Thomas had owned
the video equipment needed to view movies at home in the early 1980s...Mark came back with a straightforward answer:
Thomas not only had the video equipment in his apartment, but he also habitually rented pornographic movies from
Graffiti during the years Anita Hill worked for him. Here was the proof that Senate investigators and reporters had been
searching for during the hearings.
NYT: (Lillian McEwen) said he kept a stack of pornographic magazines, "frequented a store on Dupont Circle that catered
to his needs."
CALLS FOR INVESTIGATION
Partial Transcript of CNN's Crossfire, 6-28-2001, after TALK published the excerpt from Blinded on Kaye Savage:
Eleanor Smeal, President of Feminist Majority Foundation: "I think there should be a hearing. Not only do I think there
should be a hearing, I think that we can get to the bottom of it. There's other people now involved. There's Kaye Savage,
who was, in fact, discredited by Brock. There are other authors who have written and were discredited by Brock. There is
— essentially what Brock is saying they're very serious charges, they're not light charges. They are charges that he was
fed information, and being fed this information, they discredited people wrongfully and knowingly. And this is serious.
"And let's face it, the Supreme Court these are life-time appointments. We are sitting here with a Supreme Court that
elected this president by a five to four decision, but a Supreme Court that could reverse Roe v Wade and many many
serious things affecting women...

Wiki Leaks Accidentally Helps U.S.
by Leslie H. Gelb
November 30, 2010 I 10:42pm
Julian Assange clearly intended the State Dept. cable leaks to smear the U.S. as evil and selfish. Leslie
H. Gelb on how he inadvertently proved the opposite.
The Wikileakers dumped a vast pile of secrets to prove that the United States was selfish, stupid and wicked—but their
revelations proved just the opposite. When you remove the gossip and obvious trivia that mesmerized the press, you
clearly see what the Wikileakers never expected: A United States seriously and professionally trying to solve the most
dangerous problems in a frighteningly complicated world, yet lacking the power to dictate solutions. U.S. policymakers
and diplomats are shown, quite accurately, doing what they are supposed to do: ferreting out critical information from
foreign leaders, searching for paths to common action, and struggling with the right amount of pressure to apply on allies
and adversaries. And in most cases, the villain is not Washington, but foreign leaders escaping common action with
cowardice and hypocrisy.
Don't think for a New York minute that Julian Assange, the Wikileaker, unloaded this trove to save humankind. Why did he
toss in those cables about Italy's leader being a rake and Germany's chancellor being a cautious fuddy-duddy, and
President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan being "paranoid"? To save the world? Not a chance. He did it to get attention, and
he got attention from a drooling press, which then went on to call the very material they were highlighting trivial. Did
Assange leak critical conversations with Chinese or Arab leaders to help solve the problems in Korea and Iran? Not by the
hair on your chinny chin chin. He did it to show that he could do it—and for the attention. Anyone who is not a hopeless
left-wing ideologue knows that such leaks will crush future serious conversations with those leaders for some time to
come. Just think: if you told someone a serious and critical confidence about someone else, and your confidant went out
and told others, would you soon repeat that mistake? Assange did not leak these cables to help solve world problems.
These leaks were absolutely gratuitous and served only the purpose of making him a media marvel.
When you actually read the cables, here's what you see: American leaders and American diplomats trying to solve crucial
world In explaining his deed publicly, Assange suggests that what he's doing is uncovering American misdeeds and lies.
His aim, he says, is to inform citizens of democracies and peoples around the world about what their leaders are really
doing. Assange also insists he did this for transparency's sake. Yet when he got to look inside, he didn't see what was
plain: that our diplomats were doing a good job. Indeed, when you turn off his nonsense and stop listening to the strange
commentary on cable news and even on the front pages of great newspapers, when you actually read the cables, here's
what you see: American leaders and American diplomats trying to solve crucial world problems.
But when you turn off his nonsense and stop listening to the strange commentary on cable news and even on the front

—Washington needs China's help in bolstering sanctions against Iran, and China balks for fear of jeopardizing its oil and
gas flow from that country. The Obama team arranges for Saudi Arabia to guarantee any loss in supply to China. If the
world wants to slow or even prevent Iran's march to nuclear weaponry, this is a key path to doing so.
—
The U.S. discovers that North Korea has manufactured new medium-range missiles and is trying to deliver them to Iran
through China. The Obama team discovers this, informs Beijing, and asks Beijing to stop the transfer. Beijing declines.
Really creepy.
—
Yemen's leader takes public responsibility for American missile attacks against Al Qaeda in Yemen. He wants to
diminish the power of these terrorists, as do Americans and most others in the world. The "lie" by the Yemeni president is
a harmless way to get a critical job done—that is, the job of fighting international terrorism. Wikileaks tears away the
political cover of Yemen's leaders.

—No country has anywhere near as much influence over nutty North Korea as China. So, U.S. diplomats are searching
desperately to figure out Chinese thinking about North Korea in order to compose a plan for avoiding war on the Korean
Peninsula. So, the Wikileakers expose some Chinese leaders who are actually trying to give us some insight into Chinese
thinking about North Korean craziness. They won't do that again soon.
Time and again, as one actually reads these cables, one has to be heartened by the professionalism and the insights of
U.S. diplomats. What are they doing? They are not lying, and U.S. leaders are not lying. They are actually, believe it or
not, trying to solve problems. That seriousness of purpose and the professionalism to execute it is what jumps out at you
in these materials.
So, the naïve say, it's good to show the effectiveness of our diplomats. Give me a break. Ask any American diplomat to
choose between looking intelligent in leaked cables and making progress toward avoiding war.
None of this is to say that there should not be leaks, or that the press should not pursue classified information that is
necessary or very helpful to a sensible public debate on policy. If a U.S. administration is lying, or distorting the facts, or
telling one story to the public and another to itself, then by all means, let's have it out in public. If the U.S. government is
concocting intelligence in order to justify wars, let's hope an enterprising reporter finds it out for the rest of us.
But the Wikileaks dump is not about providing essential information to Americans or to others—information they need for
serious policy discussion. This massive trashing by Wikileaks of a legitimate effort by the U.S. government to preserve
confidentiality is the very least a shame and at the most, a crime.

Subj: Developments in Kyrgyzstan
I was in Kyrgyzstan from June 1– 6, during which time I met with almost all the
members of the interim government, with special focus on foreign relations, security and
legal issues. Here are major points that emerged from my visit:
1. Crisis in the South. Although I departed before the pogroms had commenced in Osh,
I found that the interim government fully expected violence to break out there but did not
anticipate the inter-ethnic element. Several candidly acknowledged that the
government's grip on the south, particularly Osh and Djalalabad provinces, was
extremely tenuous. They said they had severe "loyalty" problems with key figures in the
police and military. When I pressed on what they meant by "loyalty," I was told that the
Bakiyev family had "its people" in key positions in the police and army and that they had
intercepted communications between Janysh Bakiyev and a number of key security
officers in the south. "Something is being planned to disrupt the referendum," I was told.
Beknazarov told me he believed that, following the pattern of the last two revolutions,
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776492 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776492 Date: 08/31/2015
they anticipated that there would be an attack on administrative offices in the south,
following quickly within a few days by attacks in Bishkek. Government leaders I spoke
with over the weekend told me they now recognize they had misassessed the data they
had, that the Bakiyev plan was obviously to instigate inter-ethnic violence.
Precisely what led to the tragedy in and around Osh is still unclear and requires careful
investigation, but people I have spoken with in Osh describe police and army leaders
directing the pogroms, and they were able to identify some of these individuals as
persons close to the Bakiyevs. Moreover, the timing and some of the specific
descriptions of events support this thesis—Bakiyev was the only person who clearly had
something to gain from the violence. If that is so, then Bakiyev adopted an extremely
cynical, indeed criminal strategy. His objectives would have been to derail the
referendum, demonstrate the weakness of the interim government, and fuel calls for an
iron-fisted central government through the resurrection of his presidency. The tactics
used bear comparison with those used by Slobodan Milosevia and Radovan Karathle as
Yugoslavia disintegrated or by the Soviet MVD in the waning days of the Soviet empire
in programs like "Operation Koltso." If the government's charges bear out, serious
crimes were committed by the Bakiyev faction.
While Otunbayeva publicly states that order has been restored in the south and that
foreign intervention is no longer needed, I am not persuaded that this is what she actually
thinks. She is anxious to build public confidence in her government and its abilities.
Confidentially she acknowledges that the interim government's grip over the situation in
the south is extremely weak and that the government does not feel it can necessarily
count on the local police and military there, whose loyalties are plainly divided. This in
turn suggests that the international community should give active consideration to both
the humanitarian and the security dimensions of the situation in the south. My sense
remains that Otunbayeva would strongly welcome such an initiative.
2. Internal Workings of the Interim Government. The interim government verges on
being completely dysfunctional. It operates as a collection of individual fiefdoms, with
leaders engaged in constant squabbles over patronage appointments. Career civil service
personnel report being terrorized and extorted. I spent the better part of three days inside
the current government headquarters on Staraya Ploshchod and was able to directly
observe primitive horse-trading, threats and counterthreats between key government
functionaries, sometimes in agitated voices. Roza Otunbayeva and a handful of figures
closest to her were exceptions in this process—admonishing others about the
unseemliness of their conduct, urging moderation and. restraint. But Otunbayeva also
acknowledges that the limitations on her own authority and states that she "has to put up
with it," at least for the moment. Three government members advised me during
meetings of their intention to resign before the end of the month in order to start running
for parliament. Significantly, I sense sharp rifts within the government—between
Atembayev and Beknazarov, for instance, who could not refrain from criticizing one
another in my interviews with them, or between Sariyev and Beknazarov.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776492 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776492 Date: 08/31/2015
Only Otunbayeva (and to a lesser extent her close ally Elmira Ibraimova) appear to be the
glue that holds things together, commanding the respect of the other government
members. I found that the admiration for Otunbayeva was almost universal—she appears
to be the only figure in the government emerging from the interim period with an
untarnished reputation. Still the special order under which she has assumed power as
"president of the interim government" presents some clear problems for her authority.
She has a fixed term into 2011, but she will have no democratic mandate. After the new
government is formed, based on the parliamentary elections, they will have democratic
legitimacy and she will not—this sets up a situation in which her authority may well be
eclipsed or at least made more narrow. Still, all the members of the current government
recognize that she has essential skills that they do not—particularly her ability to
conciliate and her ability to reach out to other leaders on the international stage.
There is an expectation that the parliamentary elections will result in a weeding out of the
government. The next government is expected to be formed through a parliamentary
coalition. But only two or perhaps three of the current seven factions will survive. Much
of the bickering and instability in the current government is keyed to the coming game of
parliamentary moving chairs—there is an intense struggle now to secure personal loyalty
and funds to use in the parliamentary elections; the entire process has an aura of sink or
swim about it. Ironically the immediate prospect of parliamentary elections and the sense
that they will be genuinely open and fair thus contributes to the ineptness and near
chaotic appearance of the current government.
3. Constitution and Referendum. Under the guidance of Tekebayev, the government
put forward a proposed new constitution, which it seeks to have confirmed through a
referendum vote on June 27. The constitution itself does shift the country further in the
direction of a parliamentary democracy, and it contains unusual protection for
parliamentary minority factions. Government leaders told me that Kazakh president
Nursultan Nazarbayev had waded in on the question of the constitution directly, pressing
them to retain a "strong president" system. They say this was coupled with not-very-
subtle threats, and that the frontier between Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan remains closed,
with harmful consequences for the Kyrgyz economy. A major question exists about
holding the referendum as scheduled. The events in the south have resulted in the mass
displacement of population and if held as planned, a large part of the population in the
south would probably be disenfranchised. However, government leaders say that their
current problems all come back to legitimacy, and they will not be able to form a
government with democratic legitimacy without a new constitution and new elections.
Accordingly, they resist any further delays and are even contemplating moving the date
of the parliamentary election forward to the last week of August (it is now set for October
10). The crisis in the south presents a severe dilemma in this regards, and it seems that
this would have been Bakiyev's objective in instigating it, if indeed he did.
4. Manas Transit Center. As expected, I discovered that the interim government is
deeply fragmented on the question of MTC. One faction headed by Otunbayeva favors a
"pragmatic solution" to the base issue under which it will be continued but placed on a
more transparent basis in which the economic benefits to the government are clear.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776492 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776492 Date: 08/31/2015
Otunbayeva argues that the base can only be accepted under circumstances in which it
presents no friction for Kyrgyz-Russian relations; she seeks to have disputes surrounding
fuel supply, for instance, resolved directly between the United States and Russia.
Another faction, headed by Beknazarov, takes a more demagogic approach, denouncing
the base and seeking its closing in internal meetings. Talking with Beknazarov, I had the
clear impression that his attitudes were entirely opportunistic—he thinks this will be a
good campaign issue to use on the hustings. He suggested rather strongly that he could
accept a continued base presence under the right circumstances and that he views threats
to close the base as a sort of stick to use to extort more money and other concessions
from the Americans. In general, Beknazarov strikes me as hot-headed and crass and an
untrustworthy partner in any future discussions. Atembayev also has somewhat
demagogic impulses, though they are mild by comparison. Otunbayeva, the third and
most senior member of the government engaged on base issues, is the critical voice of
reason in the process. My impression based on discussions with numerous figures is that
Otunbayeva's views currently hold sway. However, all the government members are
agreed that the economic deal struck by Bakiyev is unfavorable to the Kyrgyz state and
that the base must rest on transparent economic concessions and there can be no more
under-the-table dealings with political figures.
5. Resolving the Crisis in the South. I believe that two key points should be kept in
mind when approaching the humanitarian crisis that has emerged in the south. First, the
crisis probably has its origins in a raw struggle for power. The interim government's
legitimacy deficit contributed to the problem, because it left the government with weak
tools to control the situation in the south. A long-term solution to the problem must
involve the creation of governments at the national (Bishkek) and regional (Osh,
Djalalabad) levels that have an essential modicum of democratic legitimacy. Delaying
this process may only hasten the entire country's continued descent into chaos. This
highlights the need to conduct free, fair and open elections as quickly as possible.
Second, the last thing the interim government needs is a "Sophie's choice" between the
United States and Russian Federation. International assistance needs to reflect a joint
U.S.-Russian approach and showcase U.S. and Russian leadership (not merely
participation). With President Medvedev's visit to the White House now on the horizon,
this would be a good opportunity to establish joint sponsorship of an international
humanitarian initiative. Here, I believe, are the essential elements of a program that
could achieve U.S.-Russian co-sponsorship:
An Appeal for Restraint: Although the instigation of the conflict appears clearly
to rest with ethnic Kyrgyz agitators, including a number in uniform and operating
military equipment, at present both Uzbek and Kyrgyz armed groups are involved in
random shootings designed to reinforce perceptions of their group being persecuted
(rapes etc.) by another. Credible reports are suggesting that there has been political
manipulation (including payment of money to drug and other criminal gangs) aimed at
fomenting violence. The attack on a sports facility set up by a prominent Uzbek drug
baron (murdered several years earlier) in Osh shortly before the violence started also
suggests that criminal gangs involved in drug transshipment had another motivation for
engaging in the violence. It may be that the violence was an initiative of the deposed
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776492 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776492 Date: 08/31/2015
president, but once it began, it provided cover for numerous incidents of score-settling
and criminal mischief. In these circumstances, a strong appeal for restraint is appropriate
and martial law rules including curfews may legitimately be imposed by the interim
government. An imprimatur of support from the international community would help
establish the authority of the interim government in this process.
• Exit Corridors for Civilians: Civilians who feel threatened must be allowed to
leave the high risk zones, and access of humanitarian aid, and creation of a safe zone for
humanitarian operation should be priorities at locations created to shelter them. The EU,
OSCE and UN issued a statement on June 16 calling for a humanitarian corridor in the
southern regions of Osh and Jalalabad provinces, as well as of ensuring the equitable
distribution of humanitarian aid among those in need. The cooperation of the Uzbek
government may be particularly important in this process.
• Peacekeeping/Policing Operation: The international community should support
special arrangements with broad international legitimacy and participation to enhance
peacekeeping and police operations in the affected area. As I noted, even though
Otunbayeva made a public statement on June 15 to the effect that foreign military/police
intervention was no longer needed, the situation remains precarious and in her
confidential discussions Otunbayeva acknowledges the benefits in confidence building
that would emerge from an qualified, professional and international presence in the
region. Peacekeeping/policing operations should at a minimum include security for
designated sheltering areas for refugees and internally displaced persons and monitoring
operations in tandem with local police and military, to build confidence in their protective
functions.
• Investigation of Events: a broad, credible, independent investigation should be
undertaken into the events and their origin. The investigation should be under the aegis
of an international organization, such as the Security Council or OSCE and it should be
conducted by an individual of stature with strong credentials as a fact-finder and
prosecutor. The investigation should particularly take cognizance of accusations that
crimes against humanity were perpetrated, potentially including crimes of genocide. The
involvement of persons exercising ostensible government authority—policemen, military
figures, leaders of the civil administration—should be given special scrutiny in this
process. The person commissioned to handle the investigation should be specifically
empowered to recommend criminal charges be brought against individuals identified in
his investigation—either by the criminal authorities of the Kyrgyz Republic or before an
international body seized of proper jurisdiction.
Effective Post-Conflict Reconstruction. UN authorities are estimating that as
many as 450,000 persons may have been displaced by the current violence. The
devastation in central Osh and in numerous villages is reported to be near total. There
will be an intense housing shortage and a crisis with respect to food supply and
healthcare. The international community under United States and Russian leadership
should provide generous support to jumpstart the reconstruction process, prioritizing its
assistance to benefit those most egregiously injured by the violence.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776492 Date: 08/31/2015
• The Referendum/Parliamentary Elections. In view of the disruption and
violence, the interim government may well conclude that the constitutional referendum
must be postponed. However, if it does not postpone the referendum, then extraordinary
measures should be taken.to insure that internally displaced persons and refugees are
given an opportunity to vote—in both cases this will be a reemphasis of the bond of
citizenship and a promise of inclusion in the democratic process that will be critical to the
resolution of the crisis. The international community should also mobilize observers in
connection with the parliamentary elections to help assure that candidates have fair
access to the ballot and to media, that campaigns are permitted to proceed without
unreasonable limitations and that voting occurs in a fair and free manner across the
country. Special attention in this process should be given to the affected areas to insure
that refugees and IDPs have a fair opportunity to vote and are freed from unreasonable
limitations in the process.

American Diplomacy Revealed as Good
By ROGER COHEN
NEW YORK — Let's hear it for the men and women of the U.S. Foreign Service!
They are, to judge from the WikiLeaks dump of a quarter-million of their private or secret cables, thoughtful, well-informed
and dedicated servants of the American interest who write clear, declarative English sentences.
I've not heard much in the torrent of Wiki-chatter about these admirable career diplomats whose diplomacy is now
condemned to be unquiet. Yet it is they whose lives have been upturned. Every journalist knows that if their
correspondence over several years was suddenly made public, they would lose most of their sources. That should give
every journalist pause.
So it will be on the front line of U.S. diplomacy. Contacts will self-censor. They will go quiet, particularly in the more
conspiratorial parts of the world which also tend to be the most unstable, like the Middle East. Layers of secrecy will be
added.
Julian Assange, the thin-skinned founder of WikiLeaks, has hurt U.S. interests across a broad but probably shallow
spectrum. That will satisfy him in that he's a self-styled foe of the United States. The guy makes me queasy.
Perhaps the most shocking thing about the Assange treasure trove — beyond the "shock" of venal Gulf Arab Sunni
leaders looking for war on the cheap against Shiite Iran so long as it doesn't disrupt their U.S.-armed fiefdoms; or the
"shock" of Pakistani double-dealing and nuclear procrastination; or the "shock" of yet more premature Israeli predictions
on when Iran will have a nuclear weapon; or the "shock" of continued Saudi funding of Al Qaeda; or the "shock" of the
Chinese Politburo hacking into Google; or the "shock" of Muammar el-Qaddafi's taste for voluptuous Slavic women and
Silvio Berlusconi's taste for all women — perhaps the biggest shock of all is just how professional, sober and short on
embarrassment all these cables are and just how much they conform with the world as we already knew it, right down to
the familiar adjectives evoking French President Nicolas Sarkozy: "hyperactive," "mercurial," "authoritarian," "erratic,"
"monarch-like."

American Diplomacy Revealed -- as Good
By ROGER COH.E,N
NEW YORK-- Let's hear it for the men and women of the U.S. Foreign Service!
They are, to judge from the WikiteakS dump of a 'quarter-million of their private or secret
cables, thoughtful, well-informed and dedicated servants of the American interest who write
clear, declarative English sentences.
I've not heard much in the torrent of Wiki-c.hatter about these admirable career diplomats whose
diplomacy is now condemned to be unquiet. Yet it is they whose byes have been upturned. Every
journalist knows that if their correspondence over several years was suddenly made public, they
would lose most of their sources. That should give every journalist pause.
So it will be on the front line of U.S. diplomacy. Contacts will self-censor. They will go quiet,
particularly in the more conspiratorial parts of the world which also tend to be the most unstable,

Julian Assange, the thin-skinned founder of WikiLeaks, has hurt U.S. interests across a broad but
probably shallow spectrum. That will satisfy him in that he's a self-styled foe of the United
States. The guy makes me queasy.
Perhaps the most shocking thing about the Assange treasure trove — beyond the "shock" of
venal Gulf Arab Sunni leaders looking for war on the cheap against Shiite Iran so long as it
doesn't disrupt their U.S.-armed fiefdoms; or the "shock" of Pakistani double-dealing and
nuclear procrastination; or the "shock" of yet more premature Israeli predictions on when Iran
will have a nuclear weapon; or the "shock" of continued Saudi funding of Al Qaeda; or the
"shock" of the Chinese Politburo hacking into Google; or the "shock" of Muammar el-Qaddati's

biggest shock of all is just how professional, sober and short on embarrassment all these cables

Sarah Palin is wrong about John F. Kennedy, religion and
politics
By Kathleen Kennedy Townsend
Friday, December 3, 2010; 6:00 PM
Sarah Palin has found a new opponent to debate: John F. Kennedy.
In her new book, "America by Heart," Palin objects to my uncle's famous 1960 speech to the Greater Houston Ministerial
Association, in which he challenged the ministers - and the country - to judge him, a Catholic presidential candidate, by
his views rather than his faith. "Contrary to common newspaper usage, I am not the Catholic candidate for president,"
Kennedy said. "I am the Democratic Party's candidate for president who happens also to be a Catholic."
Palin writes that when she was growing up, she was taught that Kennedy's speech had "succeeded in the best possible
way: It reconciled public service and religion without compromising either." Now, however, she says she has revisited the
speech and changed her mind. She finds it "defensive . . . in tone and content" and is upset that Kennedy, rather than
presenting a reconciliation of his private faith and his public role, had instead offered an "unequivocal divorce of the two."
Palin's argument seems to challenge a great American tradition, enshrined in the Constitution, stipulating that there be no
religious test for public office. A careful reading of her book leads me to conclude that Palin wishes for precisely such a
test. And she seems to think that she, and those who think like her, are qualified to judge who would pass and who would
not.
If there is no religious test, then there is no need for a candidate's religious affiliation to be "reconciled." My uncle urged
that religion be private, removed from politics, because he feared that making faith an arena for public contention would
lead American politics into ill-disguised religious warfare, with candidates tempted to use faith to manipulate voters and
demean their opponents.
Kennedy cited Thomas Jefferson to argue that. as part of the American tradition, it was essential to keep any semblance
of a religious test out of the political realm. Best to judge candidates on their public records, their positions on war and
peace, jobs, poverty, and health care. No one, Kennedy pointed out, asked those who died at the Alamo which church
they belonged to.
But Palin insists on evaluating and acting as an authority on candidates' faith. She faults Kennedy for not "telling the
country how his faith had enriched him." With that line, she proceeds down a path fraught with danger - precisely the path
my uncle warned against when he said that a president's religious views should be "neither imposed by him upon the
nation or imposed by the nation upon him as a condition to holding that office."
After all, a candidate's faith will matter most to those who believe that they have the right to serve as arbiters of that faith.
Is it worthy? Is it deep? Is it reflected in a certain ideology?
Palin further criticizes Kennedy because, "rather than spelling out how faith groups had provided life-changing services
and education to millions of Americans, he repeatedly objected to any government assistance to religious schools." She
does not seem to appreciate that Kennedy was courageous in arguing that government funds should not be used in
parochial schools, despite the temptation to please his constituents. Many Catholics would have liked the money. But he
wisely thought that the use of public dollars in places where nuns explicitly proselytized would be unconstitutional. Tax
money should not be used to persuade someone to join a religion.
As a contrast to Kennedy's speech, Palin cites former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney's remarks during the 2008
Republican primary campaign, in which he spoke publicly of "how my own faith would inform my presidency, if I were
elected." After paying lip service to the separation of church and state, Romney condemned unnamed enemies "intent on
establishing a new religion in America - the religion of secularism."
"There is one fundamental question about which I am often asked," Romney said. "What do I believe about Jesus Christ?"
Romney, of course, is a Mormon. He answered the question, proclaiming that "Jesus Christ is the son of God."

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777458 Date: 08/31/2015
Palin praises Romney for delivering a "thoughtful speech that eloquently and correctly described the role of faith in
American public life." But if there should be no religious test in politics, then why should a candidate feel compelled to
respond to misplaced questions about his belief in Jesus?
When George Romney, Mitt Romney's father, was a presidential candidate in 1968, he felt no such compulsion. Respect
for the Constitution and the founders' belief in the separation of church and state suggests that those kinds of questions
should not play a role in political campaigns.
Palin contends that Kennedy sought to "run away from religion." The truth is that my uncle knew quite well that what made
America so special was its revolutionary assertion of freedom of religion. No nation on Earth had ever framed in law that
faith should be of no interest to government officials. For centuries, European authorities had murdered and tortured those
whose religious beliefs differed from their own.
To demand that citizens display their religious beliefs attacks the very foundation of our nation and undermines the
precise reason that America is exceptional.
Palin's book makes clear just how dangerous her proposed path can be. Not only does she want people to reveal their
beliefs, but she wants to sit in judgment of them if their views don't match her own. For instance, she criticizes Rep. Nancy
Pelosi (Calif.), a Democrat and a faithful Catholic, for "talking the (God) talk but not walking the walk."
Who is Palin to say what God's "walk" is? Who anointed her our grand inquisitor?
This is a woman who also praises Abraham Lincoln's Second Inaugural, even though Lincoln explicitly declared, "But let
us judge not that we not be judged." The problem for those setting up a free-floating tribunal to evaluate faith is that,
contrary to Lincoln, they are installing themselves as judges who can look into others' souls and assess their worthiness.
Kennedy did not and would not do that, but not because he was indifferent to faith. In fact, unlike Romney or Palin, in
fealty to both his faith and the Constitution, he promised on that day in Houston that he would resign if his religion ever
interfered with his duty as president.
My uncle was a man who had his faith tested. His brother and brother-in-law were killed in World War II, and his sister
died in a plane crash soon after the war. He suffered from painful injuries inflicted during his Navy service when his PT
boat was cut in two by a Japanese destroyer. His God did not make life easy but did require a commitment to justice.
America's first and oniy Catholic president referred to God three times in p_;.-:
.:1,rai.adc'res and invoked the Bible's
command to care for poor and the sick. Later in his presidency, 1.-.a ur;:•:-.1uvocaliv. about riohi:s: We are
confronted primarily with a moral issue. It is as old as the Scriptures and is as clear as the American Constitution."
Faith runs as a deep current through my family. Faith inspired my uncles' and my father's dedication to justice. My father,
Robert F. Kennedy, on returning from apartheid-era South Africa in 1966, wrote a magazine article titled "Suppose God Is -
Black." And my uncle Teddy fought for health care for all Americans, even if in her book }Dalin presumes to judge that he
took positions "directly at odds with his Catholic faith."
Teddy Kennedy believed that his stands were at one with his faith. He did disagree with the Roman Catholic hierarchy at
times. But as we have seen, the hierarchy's positions can change, and in our church, we have an obligation to help bring
about those changes. That may not be Palin's theology, but the glory of America is its support for those who would
disagree - even on the most difficult and personal matters, such as religion.
John F. Kennedy knew that tearing down the wall separating church and state would tempt us toward self-righteousness
and contempt for others. That is one reason he delivered his Houston speech.
Palin, for her part, argues that "morality itself cannot be sustained without the support of religious beliefs." That statement
amounts to a wholesale attack on countless Americans, and no study or reasonable argument I have seen or heard would
support such a blanket condemnation. For a person who claims to admire Lincoln, Palin curiously ignores his injunction
that Americans, even those engaged in a Civil War, show "malice toward none, with charity for ail."
Pal in fails to understand the genius of our nation. The United States is one of the most vibrant religious countries on Earth
precisely because of its religious freedom. When power and faith are entwined, faith loses. Power tends to obfuscate,
corrupt and focus on temporal rather than eternal purposes.
Somehow Palin misses this. Perhaps she didn't read the full Houston speech; she certainly doesn't know it by heart. Or
she may be appealing to a religious right that really seeks secular power. I don't know.
I am certain, however, that no American political leader should cavalierly - or out of political calculation - dismiss the hard-
won ideal of religious freedom that is among our country's greatest gifts to the world. As John F. Kennedy said in Houston,
that is the "kind of America I believe in."

U.S. Orders Diplomats to Sto Telling Truth
httrzquIrmw.truf,hdig.coardreipiartliteir/us orders dirtbrnats to stoo teilinq truth 20'1012051
Posted on Dec 5, 2010
Fake news by Andy Borovvibe;
WASHINGTON—In the first major policy fallout from the WikiLeaks disclosures, the State Department has ordered all
U.S. diplomats to "cease and desist telling the truth until further notice."
"We are working overtime to fly to make sure that leaks like these don't happen again," Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
told reporters. "But until we've got the leaks plugged, it's incumbent on all our diplomats to put on their lying caps."
Clinton noted that since many U.S. diplomats are major political donors with long careers in the business world, "this
shouldn't be a reach for them." But for those career diplomats who came up through the Foreign Service, the State
Department will be holding a series of "truth avoidance seminars," led by executives of Goldman Sachs.
Additionally, Clinton said, the State Department would install on all diplomats' computers new software called
CandorShield', which automatically translates truthful language into a less embarrassing truth-free version. For
example, she explained, the software would translate the phrase "two-faced weasels" into "trusted Pakistani allies" and
would delete all references to French President Nicolas Sarkozy as "Monsieur Shorty Pants."
Elsewhere, Interpol issued this statement about its pursuit of WikiLea.ks founder Julian Assange: "We will find Julian
Assange, and then we will hire him."

In the Bitter New Washington

Of course Obama should have gotten out of Washington more and listened to people, not just talked at them; and, as
Walter Mondale said recently, he should have gotten rid of "those idiot boards"—the TelePrompters on which the great
orator has been strangely dependent and which divide him from his audiences. Last year, a friend of mine was invited to a
Hanukkah party that the Obamas gave for prominent Jews (a group with whom there had been tensions), and after the
Obamas descended the grand stairway, they stood in the foyer briefly; the President made a few remarks and shook a
few hands, and back up the stairs they went. No mingling.
In their first two years, the Obamas have seemed a bit tone-deaf: there were too many vacations while people were
hurting, especially Michelle's extravagant trip to Spain. (I'm as interested in Michelle's clothes as the next woman but at
the same time think she and her staff are too focused on her looking smashing, which she does. Her wardrobe seems
quite extensive for these troubled times.)
Barack Obama's personality has been much mulled over in the past two years, but it seems inescapable that his high self-
esteem often slides over the thin line to arrogance, which trickles down (with some exceptions) to much of his staff, some
of whom are downright rude to all but a chosen few. °barna has seemed uninterested in anyone but his immediate group,
and three of the four members of his immediate circle--Jarrett, Robert Gibbs, David Axelrod—had had no experience in
governing. The fourth, Rahm Emanuel, expressed himself with such flippancy, arrogance, and overuse of the F-word that
he offended not just members of Congress but also would-be allies of the President.
Vice President Joe Bider), who is liked on Capitol Hill, was virtually shut out of the dealings with people in Congress in the
first two years—"I can handle them," Obama told Biden—but Biden is now expected to be given a larger role as part of the
White House's new determination to "reach out." (A few months ago highly placed members of the staff also swore they
would "reach out," but that seemed to last for just a few days.) One of the oddest aspects of Obama's persona is that
someone who seems so confident has insisted thus far in having people around him with whom he is said to be
"comfortable."
For example, Torn Donilon, his recently appointed national security adviser (a promotion from his role as deputy), is by all
accounts a capable man but is no one's idea of a serious strategic thinker. The explanation I was given for Donilon's
being given his new position was that "the President is comfortable with him." Just as Obama is described as pleased with
himself, he has been treated with hero worship by much of his staff. After all, he had taken on the formidable Clintons,
and, against the expectation of almost all the pundits and the experts, he had beaten them. Why should he listen to those
who had doubted him? A common complaint about the Obama White House in the first two years has been that there
were no "grown-ups" around, people who knew more about governing and who would tell Obama that he was wrong.
When people tried to suggest someone who should be brought in, that person was rejected as "not one of ours." Joe
Biden is said to argue with Obama on issues, such as Afghanistan, but not to get into the management of the White
House....
Those who supported Obama in 2008 expected him to be able to move public opinion, to get people to follow him. The
fact that the Obama White House has been so poor at "messaging" baffles even his strongest supporters. In fact, he had
no overall message. As Winston Churchill put it, there was no theme to his pudding. When I asked a White House aide
about this, he pointed to what had been billed as a "major speech on the economy," at Georgetown University in April
2009. But the speech was utterly forgettable—and forgotten. One ally attributes this problem to the inexperience of both
Obama and his top staff. An ally says, "You can't leave a message if you don't have a strategy and you don't know where
you're going." Another says, "They had something that worked in the campaign but didn't work in the White House."

Thus, Obama didn't see the need to explain what he was doing. His 2010 campaign themes seemed to wander all over
the place: Stanley Greenberg, a pollster and former aide to Bill Clinton, said that Obama's oft-used theme, that we
shouldn't go back to the Bush days, actually tested negatively, because people didn't believe that the country was making
economic, progress.
So Obama's biggest failure was not to be the leader that so many expected him to be. The jubilation that surrounded his
swearing-in may have gone to his head, while the celebrants overlooked that there were plenty of people out there who
were not overjoyed at the advent of a black president, or even a Democrat. Obama was, apparently in his own estimation,
so smart and so adored that he seems to have felt no need to explain—and explain again—to the country what he was
doing and to take the country along with him. This failure to put his programs across came up a few times in the 2010
campaign....
More than once, people in town hall meetings told him that they were behind him but were having great trouble trying to
defend or explain his agenda. In a backyard gathering on October 21 he made the most awkward reply of those I heard:
"Our attitude was that we just had to get the policies right and we didn't always think about making sure we got the
advertising properly about what was going on." Advertising. (When I mentioned this to a Democratic senator who was
generally supportive of Obama, this ordinarily polite man responded, "Bullocks! What policies?")
The risk-averse Obama had left it to Congress to write the big bills such as on the economic stimulus and health care
(with strong participation by White House aides). But he kept up this line of defense all the way through to his pathetic
press conference on the day after the election. In these comments, Obama gave away the devastating fact that he didn't
really understand the role of the president as leader. A friend of the Obama administration said to me, "Their definition of
governing is passing bills." Someone else relatively close to the White House explained that since Obama had been so
criticized for being "arrogant" and "aloof," he had to eat large portions of humble pie. ("And I take responsibility for that,"
Obama said again and again.)

The unsigned editorials will appear in all of Bloomberg's online and print media properties — including Bloomberg
Businessweek, Bloomberg.corn and the nearly 300,000 financial data terminals leased to Wall Street traders and
businesses around the world. It will be run by two distinguished voices: James P. Rubin, a former assistant secretary of
state under Bill Clinton, and David Shipley, editor of The New York Times Op-Ed page.

loomberg to Publish Editorials
By ,IERE-:EviY PE.TEP.S
Being mayor of New York City would be a large enough platform for just about anyone. But apparently not for Michael R.
The mayor's company, 3loomber,
,3 L.P., said on Wednesday that it would begin publishing editorials across its vast media
enterprise in an effort to broaden the company's influence on national affairs. And though Mr. Bloomberg has an
agreement with the city to have no involvement in the "day-to-day operations" of his company, the endeavor, called
Bloomberg View, is intended to channel his personal philosophy and worldview.
"I think it's very important that everyone understands that our editorial page is going to be, for sure, consistent with the
values and beliefs of the founder — even if he happens to be mayor of New York City," said Matthew Winkler, the editor in
chief of Bloomberg News. "I fully expect us in our Bloomberg View always to reflect those values. In fact, I want people to
come away from reading the Bloomberg View infused with those beliefs and values."
The effort presents a host of conflict-of-interest questions for the mayor. The new venture provides the mayor with yet
another potent communications apparatus — one that carries his name and imprimatur — to sound off on issues that
collide with his job as mayor, his corporate interests and his expanding philanthropic empire.
Bloomberg L.P. executives said they would not shy away from publishing editorials on issues in which Mr. Bloomberg has
a direct interest as mayor, like education, public health and environmental policy. Mr. Winkler said the editorials would not
avoid such issues but would disclose the mayor's involvement when warranted.
Though Mr. Bloomberg will not have a hand in conceiving and writing the editorials, he is likely to offer feedback from time
to time before they are published, Mr. Winkler said.
"I think that there's a very good chance that's going to happen," he said, referring to Mr. Bloomberg's occasional
involvement. It is unclear whether that level of involvement is permitted under his agreement with the city to remain at
arm's length from the company.
A spokesman for the mayor, Stu Loeser, said the mayor was allowed limited involvement in his agreement with the city.
"Weighing in from time to time is consistent with his being the majority shareholder of the company he founded," he said.
As someone whose presidential ambitions are the source of endless speculation, acquiring the platform of an editorial
page is certain to draw more attention to Mr. Bloomberg's plans. (On Sunday, Mr. Bloomberg ruled out a run for
president.)
The unsigned editorials will appear in all of Bloomberg's online and print media properties — including Bloomberg
Businessweek, Bloomberg.com and the nearly 300,000 financial data terminals leased to Wall Street traders and
businesses around the world. It will be run by two distinguished voices: James P. Rubin, a former assistant secretary of
state under Bill Clinton, and David Shipley, editor of The New York Times Op-Ed page.
Opinion and commentary have not typically been areas of focus for Bloomberg, with its just-the-facts approach. In fact,
the mayor has complained about the corrosive effect of the 24-hour news cycle and overheated political commentary in
the blogosphere.
But company leaders, including Mr. Bloomberg, who has been aware of the project since it was conceived more than two
years ago, saw an opportunity to extend their influence.

For a firm that has made no secret of its ambitions to become the most influential media company in the world, starting an
editorial operation is the latest effort to propel it beyond its core mission as a financial news service.
The notion of media barons using editorials to shape public opinion and policy according to their personal views is an old
one in American journalism. William Randolph Hearst, for example, often wrote front-page editorials for his newspapers.
Mr. Bloomberg, it would seem, is casting himself in that mold, though there are no plans for him to begin writing signed
editorials. For now, he is content letting his trusted deputies speak for him.
"He's accepting and embracing the privilege of a media mogul," said David Nasaw, a professor of history at the City
University of New York Graduate Center, who wrote a biography of Hearst. "This is what we all do. We try to persuade the
rest of the world we are right. Of course we don't have the vehicles to do so. The rich have the vehicles to do so."
Mr. Winkler said: "There's a huge opportunity here for Bloomberg L.P. and Bloomberg News to seize the day, literally
seize the day by bringing wisdom to events as they unfold. And one can't always do that with the best result with
reporting."
"That certainly is a benefit to the founder of the company, the man. But it is also a huge opportunity for Bloomberg, the
company, that it should take advantage of," Mr. Winkler added.
Bloomberg L.P. acquired BusinessWeek last year, giving the 29-year-old company a print product with a long legacy of
accomplishment.
Bloomberg is in the midst of an expansion in Washington. With a service called Bloomberg Government, an operation that
will eventually employ 300 journalists and analysts, the company will sell, for $5,700 a year, information about government
services and contracts to lobbyists and others with business interests in the nation's capital.
