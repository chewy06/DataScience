Hilary,
You may know but for the last four years I have been working with the Qatari's and in particular with Sheikha Moser on
disability issues in Qatar and I have built up a good relationship with them
Sheikha Moser has approached me privately saying they are keen to get their relationship with the USA onto a more
positive footing and she was hoping for a "women-to women" one to one private meeting with you. She is happy to
come to Washington if you could make some time available.
Is this something you would be prepared o do. Sheikha Moser is someone who has real influence in Qatar and she has
made a lot of difference already with her education city and with the Shaffalah Centre for people with Disabilities in
which I am involved as the Co Chair of its Annual Disability conference. I am sure the conversation would not be
confined to these issues but would be about the US/Qatar relationship generally.

Dear Cherie--
I could make time to meet in DC during the weeks of June 8th and 15th. Would that work? I would rearrange my
schedule to fit her time.
Otherwise, I will be in Trieste, Italy and Corfu, Greece for meetings the last week in June.
Let me know if this works. Thx and all the best, H

As you know I have good links to the Qataris. Sheikha Mosah's son is the 31/32 year old Crown Prince and she is keen
that he starts to build a wider international profile. He has been appointed head of the Qatar National Food Security
Programme which is designed to deal with Qatar's food security issues its a $30 billion programme. He is aware that
food security is an issue you are majoring on and would love to meet with you in person to discuss this and to explore
potential partnership areas between US and Qatar including possible participation in the US/World Bank Food Security
Fund. He is also keen to talk more generally about US/Qatari cooperation and even suggested they could help out with
the Oil spill problem. There is apparently a Arab Food Security Summit in October 2010 and he would like to discuss Us
participation in that too.
IS a meeting possible Or maybe we could set up an initial phone
call.
Can you let me know if this appeals to you at all?

As you know I have good links to the Qataris. Sheikha Mosah's son is the 31/32 year old Crown Prince and she is keen
that he starts to build a wider international profile. He has been appointed head of the Qatar National Food Security
Programme which is designed to deal with Qatar's food security issues its a $30 billion programme. He is aware that
food security is an issue you are majoring on and would love to meet with you in person to discuss this and to explore
potential partnership areas between US and Qatar including possible participation in the US/World Bank Food Security
Fund. He is also keen to talk more generally about US/Qatari cooperation and even suggested they could help out with
the Oil spill problem. There is apparently a Arab Food Security Summit in October 2010 and he would like to discuss Us
participation in that too.
IS a meeting possible he is more flexible on place and times than his mother! Or maybe we could set up an initial phone
call.
Can you let me know if this appeals to you at all?

How about arranging a phone call between the two of you first to discuss the issues briefly then you could agree
mutually when to meet.
If you give me a time when you can take a quick phone call from the Crown Prince I will get the number for you to ring.
